<P ALIGN=CENTER>------------</P>

<P>The importance of the letters of eminent men, as illustrations of their life, character, and
times, is too well understood to need remark. The Letters of Cicero and Pliny have given us a more
vivid conception of Roman life than the most careful history could have given; the Letters of
Erasmus, Luther, and Calvin furnish us with the most trustworthy material for understanding the rapid
movement and fierce conflict of their age; when we read the voluminous correspondence of Pope and his
compeers, or the unstudied beauties of Cowper's letters of friendship, we seem to be in the company
of living men; and modern history has in nothing more distinctly proved its sagacity, than by its
diligence in publishing the Letters of Cromwell, of Washington, of Chatham, and of other historical
personages.</P>

<P>For biography, familiar letters are the most important material. In a man's published writings we
see the general character of his mind, and we ascertain his opinions in so far as he deemed it safe
or advisable to lay these before a perhaps unsympathizing public; in his letters he reveals his whole
character, his feelings as well as his judgments, his motives, his personal history, and the various
ramifications of his interest. In his familiar correspondence we see the man as he is known to his
intimate friends, in his times of relaxation and unstudied utterance.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn26.htm#P2662_987091">1</A></SUP> Few men, in writing for the public, can resist the
tendency towards a constrained attitudinizing, or throw off the fixed expression of one sitting for
his portrait; and it is only in conversation, spoken or written, that we get the whole man revealed
in a series of constantly varying and unconstrained expressions. And even where, as in Augustin's
case, we have an autobiography, we derive from the letters many additional traits of character, much
valuable illustration of opinions and progress.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn26.htm#P2663_987630">2</A></SUP> </P>

<P>In their function of appendices to history they are equally valuable. It was a characteristic
remark of Horace Walpole's, that "nothing gives so just an idea of an age as genuine letters; nay,
history waits for its last seal from them." A still greater authority, Bacon, in his marvellous
distribution of all knowledge, gives to letters the highest place among the "Appendices to History."
"Letters," he says, "are, according to all the variety of occasions, advertisements, advices,
directions, propositions, petitions commendatory, expostulatory, satisfactory; of compliment, of
pleasure, of discourse, and all other passages of action. And such as are written from wise men are,
of all the words of man, in my judgment, the best; for they are more natural than orations and public
speeches, and more advised than conferences or present speeches. So, again, letters of affairs from
such as manage them, or are privy to them, are of all others the best instructions for history, and
to a diligent reader the best histories in themselves."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn26.htm#P2665_988710">3</A></SUP> This is especially true of the Letters of Augustin.
A large number of them are ecclesiastical and theological, and would in our day have appeared as
pamphlets, or would have been delivered as lectures. There are none of his writings which do not
receive some supplementary light from his letters. The subjects of his more elaborate writings are
here handled in an easier manner, and their sources, motives, and origin are disclosed. Difficulties
which his published works had occasioned are here removed, new illustrations are noted, further
developments and fresh complications of heresy are alluded to, and the whole theological movement of
the time is here reflected in a vivid and interesting shape. No controversy of his age was settled
without his voice, and it is in his letters we chiefly see the vastness of his empire, the variety of
subjects on which appeal was made to him, and the deference with which his judgment was received.
Inquiring philosophers, puzzled statesmen, angry heretics, pious ladies, all found their way to the
Bishop of Hippo. And while he continually complains of want of leisure, of the multifarious business
of his episcopate, of the unwarranted demands made upon him, he yet carefully answers all. Sometimes
he writes with the courier who is to carry his letter impatiently chafing outside the door; sometimes
a promptly written reply is carried round the whole known world by some faithless messenger before it
reaches his anxious correspondent; but, amidst difficulties unthought of under a postal system, his
indefatigable diligence succeeds in diffusing intelligence and counsel to the most distant
inquirers.</P>

<P>In the present volume we have, as usual, followed the Benedictine edition. Among the many labours
which the Benedictine Fathers encountered in editing the works of Augustin, they undertook the
onerous task of rearranging the Epistles in chronological order. The manner in which this task has
been executed is eminently characteristic of their unostentatious patience and skill. Their order has
been universally adopted; it is to this order that reference is made when any writer cites a letter
of Augustin's; and therefore it matters less whether in each case the date assigned by the
Benedictine editors can be accepted as accurate. It will be seen that we have not considered it
desirable to translate all the letters. Of those addressed to Augustin we have omitted a few which
were neither important in themselves nor indispensable for the understanding of his replies; and,
when any of his own letters is a mere repetition of what he has previously written to another
correspondent, we have contented ourselves, and, we hope, shall satisfy our readers, with a reference
to the former letter in which the arguments and illustrations now repeated may be found.</P>

<P>No English translation of these Letters has previously appeared. The French have in this, as in
other patristic studies, been before us. Two hundred years ago a translation into the French tongue
was published, and this has lately been superseded by M. Poujoulat's four readable and fairly
accurate volumes.</P>

<P>The Editor. 1872.</P>

<P>In the second volume of Letters in Clark's series the editor adds the following</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT  SIZE="+2">Prefatory Note.</FONT></P>

<P>Of the two hundred and seventy-two letters given in the Benedictine edition of Augustin's works,
one hundred and sixty are translated in this selection. In the former volume few were omitted, and
the reason for each omission was given in its own place. As the proportion of untranslated letters is
in this volume much larger, it may be more convenient to indicate briefly here the general reasons
which have guided us in the selection.</P>

<P>We have omitted-</P>

<P>I. Almost all the letters referring to the Donatist schism, as there is enough on this subject in
the works on the Donatist controversy (vol. iii. of this series) and in numerous earlier letters.
This excludes-105, 106, 107, 108, 128, 129, 134, 141, 142, and 204.</P>

<P>II. Almost all the letters relating to Pelagianism, as the series contains three volumes of
Augustin's anti-Pelagian writings (vols. iv. xii. xv.). This excludes-156, 157, 175, 176, 177, 178,
179, 181, 182, 183, 184, 184 <I>bis</I>, 186, 193, 194, 214, 215, 216, 217. </P>

<P>III. Almost all the letters referring to the doctrine of the Trinity, as this has been already
given, partly in earlier letters, and more fully in the volume on the Trinity (vol. vii. of this
series). This excludes-119, 120, 170, 174, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242.</P>

<P>IV. Almost all those which in design, style, and prolixity, are exegetical or doctrinal treatises
rather than letters. This excludes-140, 147, 149, 152, 153, 154, 155, 162, 187, 190, 196, 197, 198,
199, 202 <I>bis</I>, 205.</P>

<P>V. Some of the letters written by others to Augustin. This excludes-94, 109, 121, 160, 168, 225,
226, 230, 270.</P>

<P>VI. A large number of miscellaneous smaller letters, as, in order to avoid going beyond the limits
of one volume, it was necessary to select only the more interesting and important of these. This
excludes-110, 112, 113, 114, 127, 161, 162, 171, 200, 206, 207, 221, 222, 223, 224, 233, 234, 235,
236, 243, 244, 247, 248, 249, 251, 252, 253, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 264, 265, 266,
267, 268. </P>

  <UL><P><I>To Hermogenianus</I><SUP><A HREF="#P2684_993969">1</A></SUP><I> Augustin
Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I Would not presume, even in playful discussion, to attack the philosophers of the
Academy;<SUP><A HREF="#P2686_994226">2</A></SUP> for when could the authority of
such eminent men fail to move me, did I not believe their views to be widely different from those
commonly ascribed to them? Instead of confuting them, which is beyond my power, I have rather
imitated them to the best of my ability. For it seems to me to have been suitable enough to the times
in which they flourished, that whatever issued pure from the fountainhead of Platonic philosophy
should be rather conducted into dark and thorny thickets for the refreshment of a very few
<I>men</I>, than left to flow in open meadow-land, where it would be impossible to keep it clear and
pure from the inroads of the vulgar herd. I use the word herd advisedly; for what is more brutish
than the opinion that the soul is material? For defence against the men who held this, it appears to
me that such an art and method of concealing the truth<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn26.htm#P2687_995439">3</A></SUP> was wisely contrived by the new Academy. But in
this age of ours, when we see none who are philosophers,-for I do not consider those who merely wear
the cloak of a philosopher to be worthy of that venerable name,-it seems to me that men (those, at
least, whom the teaching of the Academicians has, through the subtlety of the terms in which it was
expressed, deterred from attempting to understand its actual meaning) should be brought back to the
hope of discovering the truth, lest that which was then for the time useful in eradicating obstinate
error, should begin now to hinder the casting in of the seeds of true knowledge.</P>

<P>2. In that age the studies of contending schools of philosophers were pursued with such ardour,
that the one thing to be feared was the possibility of error being approved. For every one who had
been driven by the arguments of the sceptical philosophers from a position which he had supposed to
be impregnable, set himself to seek some other in its stead, with a perseverance and caution
corresponding to the greater industry which was characteristic of the men of that time, land the
strength of the persuasion then prevailing, that truth, though deep and hard to be deciphered, does
lie hidden in the nature of things and of the human mind. Now, however, such is the indisposition to
strenuous exertion, and the indifference to the liberal arts, that so soon as it is noised abroad
that, in the opinion of the most acute philosophers, truth is unattainable, men send their minds to
sleep, and cover them up for ever. For they presume not, forsooth, to imagine themselves to be so
superior in discernment to those great men, that they shall find out what, during his singularly long
life, Carneades,<SUP><A HREF="#P2689_997211">4</A></SUP> with all his diligence,
talents, and leisure, besides his extensive and varied learning, failed to discover. And if,
contending somewhat against indolence, they rouse themselves so far as to read those books in which
it is, as it were, proved that the perception of truth is denied to man, they relapse into lethargy
so profound, that not even by the heavenly trumpet can they be aroused.</P>

<P>3. Wherefore, although I accept with the greatest pleasure your candid estimate of my brief I
treatise, and esteem you so much as to rely not less on the sagacity of your judgment than on the
sincerity of your friendship, I beg you to give more particular attention to one point, and to write
me again concerning it,-namely, whether you approve of that which, in the end of the third
book,<SUP><A HREF="#P2691_998286">5</A></SUP> I have given as my opinion, in a tone
perhaps of hesitation rather than of certainty, but in statements, as I think, more likely to be
found useful than to be rejected as incredible. But whatever be the value of those treatises [the
books against the Academicians], what I most rejoice in is, not that I have vanquished the
Academicians, as you express it (using the language rather of friendly partiality than of truth), but
that I have broken and cast away from me the odious bonds by which I was kept back from the
nourishing breasts of philosophy, through despair of attaining that truth which is the food of the
soul.</P>

HREF="footnote/fn26.htm#P2696_999017">6</A></SUP><I> </I></P>

</UL><P>1. We are, I suppose, both agreed in maintaining that all things with which our bodily senses
acquaint us are incapable of abiding unchanged for a single moment, but, on the contrary, are moving
and in perpetual transition, and have no present reality, that is, to use the language of Latin
philosophy, do not exist.<SUP><A HREF="#P2698_999497">7</A></SUP> Accordingly, the
true and divine philosophy admonishes us to check and subdue the love of these things as most
dangerous and disastrous, in order that the mind, even while using this body, may be wholly occupied
and warmly interested in those things which are ever the same, and which owe their attractive power
to no transient charm. Although this is all true, and although my mind, without the aid of the
senses, sees you as you really are, and as an object which may be loved without disquietude,
nevertheless I must own that when you are absent in body, and separated by distance, the pleasure of
meeting and seeing you is one which I miss, and which, therefore, while it is attainable, I earnestly
covet. This my infirmity (for such it must be) is one which, if I know you aright, you are well
pleased to find in me; and though you wish every good thing for your best and most loved friends, you
rather fear than desire that they should be cured of this infirmity. If, however, your soul has
attained to such strength that you are able both to discern this snare, and to smile at those who are
caught therein, truly you are great, and different from what I am. For my part, as long as I regret
the absence of any one from me, so long do I wish him to regret my absence. At the same time, I watch
and strive to set my love as little as possible on anything which can be separated from me against my
will. Regarding this as my duty, I remind you, in the meantime, whatever be your frame of mind, that
the discussion which I have begun with you must be finished, if we care for each other. For I can by
no means consent to its being finished with Alypius, even if he wished it. But he does not wish this;
for he is not the man to join with me now in endeavouring, by as many letters as we could send, to
detain you with us, when you decline this, under the pressure of some necessity to us unknown.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Nebridius Augustin Sends Greeting.</I><SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2703_1001488">8</A></SUP><I> </I></P>

</UL><P>1. Whether I am to regard it as the effect of what I may call your flattering language, or
whether the thing be really so, is a point which I am unable to decide. For the impression was
sudden, and I am not yet resolved how far it deserves to be believed. You wonder what this can be.
What do you think? You have almost made me believe, not indeed that I am happy-for that is the
heritage of the wise alone-but that I am at least in a sense happy: as we apply the designation
<I>man</I> to beings who deserve the name only in a sense if compared with Plato's ideal man, or
speak of things which we see as <I>round</I> or <I>square</I>, although they differ widely from the
perfect figure which is discerned by the mind of a few. I read your letter beside my lamp after
supper: immediately after which I lay down, but not at once to sleep; for on my bed I meditated long,
and talked thus with myself-Augustin addressing and answering Augustin: "Is it not true, as Nebridius
affirms, that I am happy?" "Absolutely true it cannot be, for that I am still far from wise he
himself would not deny." "But may not a happy life be the lot even of those who are not wise?" "That
is scarcely possible; because, in that case, lack of wisdom would be a small misfortune, and not, as
it actually is, the one and only source of unhappiness." "How, then, did Nebridius come to esteem me
happy? Was it that, after reading these little books of mine, he ventured to pronounce me wise?
Surely the vehemence of joy could not make him so rash, especially seeing that he is a man to whose
judgment I well know so much weight is to be attached. I have it now: he wrote what he thought would
be most gratifying to me, because he had been gratified by what I had written in those treatises; and
he wrote in a joyful mood, without accurately weighing the sentiments entrusted to his joyous pen.
What, then, would he have said if he had read my <I>Soliloquies</I>? He would have rejoiced with much
more exultation, and yet could find no loftier name to bestow on me than this which he has already
given in calling me happy. All at once, then, he has lavished on me the highest possible name, and
has not reserved a single word to add to my praises, if at any time he were made by me more joyful
than he is now. See what joy does."</P>

<P>2. But where is that truly happy life? where? ay, where? Oh! if it were attained, one would spurn
the atomic theory of Epicurus. Oh! if it were attained, one would know that there is nothing here
below but the visible world. Oh! if it were attained, one would know that in the rotation of a globe
on its axiS, the motion of points near the poles is less rapid than of those which lie half way
between them,-and other such like things which we likewise know. But now, how or in what sense can I
be called happy, who know not why the world is such in size as it is, when the proportions of the
figures according to which it is framed do in no way hinder its being enlarged to any extent desired?
Or how might it not be said to me-nay, might we not be compelled to admit that matter is infinitely
divisible; so that, starting from any given base (so to speak), a definite number of corpuscles must
rise to a definite and ascertainable quantity? Wherefore, seeing that we do not admit that any
particle is so small as to be insusceptible of further diminution, what compels us to admit that any
assemblage of parts is so great that it cannot possibly be increased? Is there perchance some I
important truth in what I once suggested confidentially to Alypius, that since number, as cognisable
by the understanding, is susceptible of infinite augmentation, but not of infinite diminution,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2706_1005280">9</A></SUP> because we cannot reduce it lower than to the
units, number, as cognisable by the senses (and this, of course, just means quantity of material
parts or bodies), is on the contrary susceptible of infinite diminution, but has a limit to its
augmentation? This may perhaps be the reason why philosophers justly pronounce riches to be found in
the things about which the understanding is exercised, and poverty in those things with which the
senses have to do. For what is poorer than to be susceptible of endless diminution? and what more
truly rich than to increase as much as you will, to go whither you will, to return when you will and
as far as you will, and to have as the object of your love that which is large and cannot be made
less? For whoever understands these numbers loves nothing so much as the unit; and no wonder, seeing
that it is through it that all the other numbers can be loved by him. But to return: Why is the world
the size that it is, seeing that it might have been greater or less? I do not know: its dimensions
are what they are, and I can go no further. Again: Why is the world in the place it now occupies
rather than in another? Here, too, it is better not to put the question; for whatever the answer
might be, other questions would still remain. This one thing greatly perplexed me, that bodies could
be infinitely subdivided. To this perhaps an answer has been given, by setting over against it the
converse property of abstract number [viz. its susceptibility of infinite multiplication].</P>

<P>3. But stay: let us see what is that indefinable object<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2708_1007406">10</A></SUP> which is suggested to the mind. This world with
which our senses acquaint us is surely the image of some world which the understanding apprehends.
Now it is a strange phenomenon which we observe in the images which mirrors reflect to us,-that
however great the mirrors be, they do not make the images larger than the objects placed before them,
be they ever so small; but in small mirrors, such as the pupil of the eye, although a large surface
be placed over against them, a very small image is formed, proportioned to the size of the
mirror.<SUP><A HREF="#P2709_1007969">11</A></SUP> Therefore if the mirrors be
reduced in size, the images reflected in them are also reduced; but it is not possible for the images
to be enlarged by enlarging the mirrors. Surely there is in this something which might reward further
investigation; but meanwhile, I must sleep.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2710_1008417">12</A></SUP> Moreover, if I seem to Nebridius to be happy, it
is not because I seek, but because perchance I have found something. What, then, is that something?
Is it that chain of reasoning which I am wont so to caress as if it were my sole treasure, and in
which perhaps I take too much delight?</P>

<P>4. "Of what parts do we consist?" "Of soul and body." "Which of these is the nobler?" "Doubtless
the soul." "What do men praise in the body? . . . Nothing that I see but comeliness." "And what is
comeliness of body?" "Harmony of parts in the form, together with a certain agreeableness of colour."
"is this comeliness better where it is true or where it is illusive?" "Unquestionably it is better
where it is true." "And where is it found true? In the soul." "The soul, therefore, is to be loved
more than the body; but in what part of the soul does this truth reside?" "In the mind and
understanding." "With what has the understanding to contend?" "With the senses." "Must we then resist
the senses with all our might?" "Certainly." "What, then, if the things with which the senses
acquaint us give us pleasure? . . . We must prevent them from doing so." "How?" "By acquiring the
habit of doing without them, and desiring better things." "But if the soul die, what then? . . . Why,
then truth dies, or intelligence is not truth, or intelligence is not a part of the soul, Or that
which has some part immortal is liable to die: conclusions all of which I demonstrated long ago in my
<I>Soliloquies</I> to be absurd because impossible; and I am firmly persuaded that this is the case,
but somehow through the influence of custom in the experience of evils we are terrified, and
hesitate. But even granting, finally, that the soul dies, which I do not see to be in any way
possible, it remains nevertheless true that a happy life does not consist in the evanescent joy which
sensible objects can yield: this I have pondered deliberately, and proved."</P>

<P>Perhaps it is on account of reasonings such as these that I have been judged by my own Nebridius
to be, if not absolutely happy, at least in a sense happy. I,et me also judge myself to be happy: for
what do I lose thereby, or why should I grudge to think well of my own estate? Thus I talked with
myself, then prayed according to my custom, and fell asleep.</P>

<P>5. These things I have thought good to write to you. For it gratifies me that you should thank me
when I write freely to you whatever crosses my mind; and to whom can I more willingly write
nonsense<SUP><A HREF="#P2714_1010922">13</A></SUP> than to one whom I cannot
displease? But if it depends upon fortune whether one: man love another or not, look to it, I pray
you, how can I be justly called happy when I am I so elated with joy by fortune's favours, and
avowedly desire that my store of such good things may be largely increased? For those who are most
truly wise, and whom alone it is right to pronounce happy, have maintained that fortune's favours
ought not to be the objects of either fear or desire.</P>

<P>Now here I used the word "<I>cupi</I>:"<SUP><A HREF="#P2716_1011440">14</A></SUP>
will you tell me whether it should be "<I>cupi</I>" or "<I>cupiri</I>?" And I am glad this has come
in the way, for I wish you to instruct me in the inflexion of this verb "<I>cupio</I>," since, when I
compare similar verbs with it, my uncertainty as to the proper inflexion increases. For
"<I>cupio</I>" is like "<I>fugio</I>," "<I>sapio</I>," "<I>jacio</I>," "<I>capio</I>;" but whether
the infinitive mood is "<I>fugiri</I>" or "<I>fugi</I>," "<I>sapiri</I>" or "<I>sapi</I>," I do not
know. I might regard "<I>jaci</I>" and "<I>capi</I>"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2717_1011938">15</A></SUP> as parallel instances answering my question as to
the others, were I not afraid lest some grammarian should "catch" and "throw" me like a ball in sport
wherever he pleased, by reminding me that the form of the supines "<I>jactum</I>" and "<I>captum</I>"
is different from that found in the other verbs "<I>fugitum</I>," "<I>cupitum</I>" and
"<I>sapitum</I>." As to these three words, moreover, I am likewise ignorant whether the penultimate
is to be pronounced long and with circumflex accent, or without accent and short. I would like to
provoke you to write a reasonably long letter. I beg you to let me have what it will take some time
to read. For it is far beyond my power to express the pleasure which I find in reading what you
write.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Nebridius Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. It is very wonderful how completely I was taken by surprise, when, on searching to
discover which of your letters still remained unanswered, I found only one which held me as your
debtor,-that, namely, in which you request me to tell you how far in this my leisure, which you
suppose to be great, and which you desire to share with me, I am making progress in learning to
discriminate those things in nature with which the senses are conversant, from those about which the
understanding is employed. But I suppose it is not unknown to you, that if one becomes more and more
fully imbued with false opinions, the more fully and intimately one exercises himself in them, the
corresponding effect is still more easily produced in the mind by contact with truth. Nevertheless my
progress, like our physical development, is so gradual, that it is difficult to define its steps
distinctly, just as though there iS a very great difference between a boy and a young man, no one, if
daily questioned from his boyhood onward, could at an.y one date say that now he was no more a boy,
but a young man.</P>

<P>2. I would not have you, however, so to apply this illustration as to suppose that, in the vigour
of a more powerful understanding, I have arrived as it were at the beginning of the soul's manhood.
For I am yet but a boy, though perhaps, as we say, a promising boy, rather than a good-for-nothing.
For although the eyes of my mind are for the most part perturbed and oppressed by the distractions
produced by blows inflicted through things sensible, they are revived and raised up again by that
brief process of reasoning: "The mind and intelligence are superior to the eyes and the common
faculty of sight; which could not be the case unless the things which we perceive by intelligence
were more real than the things which we perceive by the faculty .of sight." I pray you to help me in
examining whether any valid objection can be brought against this reasoning. By it, meanwhile, I find
myself restored and refreshed; and when, after calling upon God for help, I begin to rise to Him, and
to those things which are in the highest sense real, I am at times satisfied with such a grasp and
enjoyment of the things which eternally abide, that I sometimes wonder at my requiring any such
reasoning as I have above given to persuade me of the reality of those things which in my soul are as
truly present to me as I am to myself.</P>

<P>Please look over your letters yourself, for I own that you will be in this matter at greater pains
than I, in order to make sure that I am not perchance unwittingly still owing an answer to any of
them: for I can hardly believe that I have so soon got from under the burden of debts which I used to
reckon as so numerous; albeit, at the same time, I cannot doubt that you have had some letters from
me to which I have as yet received no reply.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Augustin Nebridius Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>Is it true, my beloved Augustin, that you are spending your strength and patience on the
affairs of your fellow-citizens (in Thagaste), and that the leisure from distractions which you so
earnestly desired is still withheld from you? Who, I would like to know, are the men who thus take
advantage of your good nature, and trespass on your time? I believe that they do not know what you
love most and long for. Have you no friend at hand to tell them what your heart is set upon? Will
neither Romanianus nor Lucinianus do this? Let them hear me at all events. I will proclaim aloud; I
will protest that God is the supreme object of your love, and that your heart's desire is to be His
servant, and to cleave to Him. Fain would I persuade you to come to my home in the country, and rest
here; I shall not be afraid of being denounced as a robber by those countrymen of yours, whom you
love only too well, and by whom you are too warmly loved in return.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Augustin Nebridius Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Your letters I have great pleasure in keeping as carefully as my own eyes. For they are
great, not indeed in length, but in the greatness of the subjects discussed in them, and in the great
ability With which the truth in regard to these subjects is demonstrated. They shall bring to my ear
the voice of Christ, and the teaching of Plato and of Plotinus. To me, therefore, they shall ever be
pleasant Lo hear, because of their eloquent style; easy to read, because of their brevity; and
profitable to understand, because of the wisdom which they contain. Be at pains, therefore, to teach
me everything which, to your judgment, commends itself as holy or good. As to this letter in
particular, answer it when you are ready to discuss a subtle problem in regard to memory, and the
images presented by the imagination.<SUP><A HREF="#P2735_1017535">16</A></SUP> My
opinion is, that although there can be such images independently of memory, there is no exercise of
memory independently of such images.<SUP><A HREF="#P2736_1017692">17</A></SUP> You
will say, What, then, takes place when memory is exercised in recalling an act of understanding or of
thought? I answer this objection by saying, that such acts can be recalled by memory for this reason,
that in the supposed act of understanding or of thought we gave birth to something conditioned by
space or by time, which is of such a nature that it can be reproduced by the imagination: for either
we connected the use of words with the exercise of the understanding and with the thoughts, and words
are conditioned by time, and thus fall within the domain of the senses or of the imaginative faculty;
or if we did not join words with the mental act, our intellect at all events experienced in the act
of thinking something which was of such a nature as could produce in the mind that which, by the aid
of the imaginative faculty, memory could recall. These things I have stated, as usual, without much
consideration, and in a somewhat confused manner: do you examine them, and, rejecting what is false,
acquaint me by letter with what you hold as the truth on this subject.</P>

<P>2. Listen also to this question: Why, I should like to know, do we not affirm that the phantasy
[imaginative faculty] derives all its images from itself, rather than say that it receives these from
the senses? For it is possible that, as the intellectual faculty of the soul is indebted to the
senses, not for the objects upon which the intellect is exercised, but rather for the admonition
arousing it to see these objects, in the same manner the imaginative faculty may be indebted to the
senses, not for the images which are the objects upon which it is exercised, but rather for the
admonition arousing it to contemplate these images. And perhaps it is in this way that we are to
explain the fact that the imagination perceives some objects which the senses never perceived,
whereby it is shown that it has all its images within itself, and from itself. You will answer me
what you think of this question also. </P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 389.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Nebridius Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.-<I>Memory may be exercised independently of such images as are presented by the
imagination.</I></P>

<P>1. I shall dispense with a formal preface, and to the subject on which you have for some time
wished to hear my opinion I shall address myself at once; and this I do the more willingly, because
the statement must take some time.</P>

<P>It seems to you that there can be no exercise of memory without images, or the apprehension of
some objects presented by the imagination, which you have been pleased to call "phantasiae." For my
part, I entertain a different opinion. In the first place, we must observe that the things which we
remember are not always things which are passing away, but are for the most part things which are
permanent. Wherefore, seeing that the function of memory is to retain hold of what belongs to time
past, it is certain that it embraces on the one hand things which leave us, and on the other hand
things from which we go away. When, for example, I remember my father, the object which memory
recalls is one which has left me, and is now no more; but when I remember Carthage, the object is in
this case one which still exists, and which I have left. In both cases, however, memory retains what
belongs to past time. For I remember that man and this city, not by seeing them now, but by having
seen them in the past.</P>

<P>2. You perhaps ask me at this point, Why bring forward these facts? And you may do this the more
readily, because you observe that in both the examples quoted the object remembered can come to my
memory in no other way than by the apprehension of such an image as you affirm to be always
necessary. For my purpose it suffices meanwhile to have proved in this way that memory can be spoken
of as embracing also those things which have not yet passed away: and now mark attentively how this
supports my opinion. Some men raise a groundless objection to that most famous theory invented by
Socrates, according to which the things that we learn are not introduced to our minds as new, but
brought back to memory by a process of recollection; supporting their objection by affirming that
memory has to do only with things which have passed away, whereas, as Plato himself has taught, those
things which we learn by the exercise of the understanding are permanent, and being imperishable,
cannot be numbered among things which have passed away: the mistake into which they have fallen
arising obviously from this, that they do not consider that it is only the mental act of apprehension
by which we have discerned these things which belongs to the past; and that it is because we have, in
the stream of mental activity, left these behind, and begun in a variety of ways to attend to other
things, that we require to return to them by an effort of recollection, that is, by memory. if,
therefore, passing over other examples, we fix our thoughts upon eternity itself as something which
is for ever permanent, and consider, on the one hand, that it does not require any image fashioned by
the imagination as the vehicle by which it may be introduced into the mind; and, on the other hand,
that it could never enter the mind otherwise than by our remembering it,-we shall see that, in regard
to some things at least, there can be an exercise of memory without any image of the thing remembered
being presented by the imagination.</P>

<P>Chap. II.-<I>The mind is destitute of images presented by the imagination, so long as it has not
been informed by the senses of external things.</I></P>

<P>3. In the second place, as to your opinion that it is possible for the mind to form to itself
images of material things independently of the services of the bodily senses, this is refuted by the
following argument:-If the mind is able, before it uses the body as its instrument in perceiving
material objects, to form to itself the images of these; and if, as no sane man can doubt, the mind
received more reliable and correct impressions before it was involved in the illusions which the
senses produce, it follows that we must attribute greater value to the impressions of men asleep than
of men awake, [and of men insane than of those who are free from such mental disorder: for they are,
in these states of mind, impressed by the same kind of images as impressed them before they were
indebted for information to these most deceptive messengers, the senses; and thus, either the sun
which they see must be more real than the sun which is seen by men in their sound judgment and in
their waking hours, or that which is an illusion must be better than what is real. But if these
conclusions, my dear Nebridius, are, as they obviously are, wholly absurd, it is demonstrated that
the image of which you speak is nothing else than a blow inflicted by the senses, the function of
which in connection with these images is not, as you write, the mere suggestion or admonition
occasioning their formation by the mind within itself, but the actual bringing in to the mind, or, to
speak more definitely, impressing upon it of the illusions to which through the senses we are
subject. The difficulty which you feel as to the question how it comes to pass that we can conceive
in thought, faces and forms which we have never seen, is one which proves the acuteness of your mind.
I shall therefore do what may extend this letter beyond the usual length; not, however, beyond the
length which you will approve, for I believe that the greater the fulness with which I write to you,
the more welcome shall my letter be.</P>

<P>4. I perceive that all those images which you as well as many others call <I>phantasiae</I>, may
be most conveniently and accurately divided into three classes, according as they originate with the
senses, or the imagination, or the faculty of reason. Examples of the first class are when the mind
forms within itself and presents to me the image of your face, or of Carthage, or of our departed
friend Verecundus, or of any other thing at present or formerly existing, which I have myself seen
and perceived. Under the second class come. all things which we imagine to have been, or to be so and
so: <I>e.g.</I> when, for the sake of illustration in discourse, we ourselves suppose things which
have no existence, but which are not prejudicial to truth; or when we call up to our own minds a
lively conception of the things described while we read history, or hear, or compose, or refuse to
believe fabulous narrations. Thus, according to my own fancy, and as it may occur to my own mind, I
picture to myself the appearance of Aeneas, or of Medea with her team of winged dragons, or of
Chremes, or Parmeno.<SUP><A HREF="#P2749_1026448">18</A></SUP> To this class belong
also those things which have been brought forward as true, either by wise men wrapping up some truth
in the folds of such inventions, or by foolish men building up various kinds of superstition;
<I>e.g.</I> the Phlegethon of Tortures, and the five caves of the nation of darkness,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2750_1026778">19</A></SUP> and the North Pole supporting the heavens, and a
thousand other prodigies of poets and of heretics. Moreover, we often say, when carrying on a
discussion, "Suppose that three worlds, such as the one which we inhabit, were placed one above
another;" or, "Suppose the earth to be enclosed within a four-sided figure," and so on: for all such
things we picture to ourselves, and imagine according to the mood and direction of our thoughts. As
for the third class of images, it has to do chiefly with numbers and measure; which are found partly
in the nature of things, as when the figure of the entire world is discovered, and an image
consequent upon this discovery is formed in the mind of one thinking upon it; and partly in sciences,
as in geometrical figures and musical harmonies, and in the infinite variety of numerals: which,
although they are, as I think, true in themselves as objects of the understanding, are nevertheless
the causes of illusive exercises of the imagination, the misleading tendency of which reason itself
can only with difficulty withstand; although it is not easy to preserve even the science of reasoning
free from this evil, since in our logical divisions and conclusions we form to ourselves, so to
speak, calculi or counters to facilitate the process of reasoning.</P>

<P>5. In this whole forest of images, I believe that you do not think that those of the first class
belong to the mind previous to the time when they find access through the senses. On this we need not
argue any further. As to the other two classes a question might reasonably be raised, were it not
manifest that the mind is less liable to illusions when it has not yet been subjected to the
deceptive influence of the senses, and of things sensible; and yet who can doubt that these images
are much more unreal than those with which the senses acquaint us? For the things which we suppose,
or believe, or picture to ourselves, are in every point wholly unreal; and the things which we
perceive by sight and the other senses, are, as you see, far more near to the truth than these
products of imagination. As to the third class, whatever extension of body in space I figure to
myself in my mind by means of an image of this class, although it seems as if a process of thought
had produced this image by scientific reasonings which did not admit of error, nevertheless I prove
it to be deceptive, these same reasonings serving in turn to detect its falsity. Thus it is wholly
impossible for me to believe [as, accepting your opinion, I must believe] that the soul, while not
yet using the .bodily senses, and not yet rudely assaulted through these fallacious instruments by
that which is mortal and fleeting, lay under such ignominious subjection to illusions.</P>

<P>Chap. III.-<I>Objection answered</I>.</P>

<P>6. "Whence then comes our capacity conceiving in thought things which we have never seen?" What,
think you, can be the cause of this, but a certain faculty of diminution and addition which is innate
in the mind, and which it cannot but carry with it whithersoever it turns (a faculty which may be
observed especially in relation to numbers)? By the exercise of this faculty, if the image of a crow,
for example, which is very familiar to the eye; be set before the eye of the mind, as it were, it may
be brought, by the taking away of some features and the addition of others, to almost any image such
as never was seen by the eye. By this faculty also it comes to pass, that when men's minds habitually
ponder such things, figures of this kind force their way as it were unbidden into their thoughts.
Therefore it is possible for the mind, by taking away, as has been said, some things from objects
which the senses have brought within its knowledge, and by adding some things, to produce in the
exercise of imagination that which, as a whole, was never within the observation of any of the
senses; but the parts of it had all been within such observation, though found in a variety of
different things: <I>e.g.</I>, when we were boys, born and brought up in an inland district, we could
already form some idea of the sea, after we had seen water even in a small cup; but the flavour of
strawberries and of cherries could in no wise enter our conceptions before we tasted these fruits in
Italy. Hence it is also, that those who have been born blind know not what to answer when they are
asked about light and colours. For those who have never perceived coloured objects by the senses are
not capable of having the images of such objects in the mind.</P>

<P>7. And let it not appear to you strange, that though the mind is present in and intermingled with
all those images which in the nature of things are figured or can be pictured by us, these are not
evolved by the mind from within itself before it has received them through the. senses from without.
For we also find that,. along with anger, joy, and other such emotions, we produce changes in our
bodily aspect and complexion, before our thinking faculty even conceives that we have the power of
producing such images [or indications of our feeling]. These follow upon the experience of the
emotion in those wonderful ways (especially deserving your attentive consideration), which consist in
the repeated action and reaction of hidden numbers<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2755_1032086">20</A></SUP> in the soul, without the intervention of any
image of illusive material things. Whence I would have you understand-perceiving as you do that so
many movements of the mind go on wholly independently of the images in question-that of all the
movements of the mind by which it may conceivably attain to the knowledge of bodies, every other is
more likely than the process of creating forms of sensible things by unaided thought, because I do
not think that it is capable of any such conceptions before it uses the body and the senses.</P>

<P>Wherefore, my well beloved and most amiable brother, by the friendship which unites us, and by our
faith in the divine law itself,<SUP><A HREF="#P2757_1032780">21</A></SUP> I would
warn you never to link yourself in friendship with those shadows of the realm of darkness, and to
break off without delay whatever friendship may have been begun between you and them. That resistance
to the sway of the bodily senses which it is our most sacred duty to practise, is wholly abandoned if
we treat with fondness and flattery the blows and wounds which the senses inflict upon us.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Augustin Nebridius Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. As I am in haste to come to the subject of my letter, I dispense with any preface or
introduction. When at any time it pleases higher (by which I mean heavenly) powers to reveal anything
to us by dreams in our sleep, how is this done, my dear Augustin, or what is the method which they
use? What, I say, is their method, <I>i.e.</I> by what art or magic, by what agency or enchantments,
do they accomplish this? Do they by their thoughts influence our minds, so that we also have the same
images presented in our thoughts? Do they bring before us, and exhibit as actually done in their own
body or in their own imagination, the things which we dream? But if they actually do these things in
their own body, it follows that, in order to our seeing what they thus do, we must be endowed with
other bodily eyes beholding what passes within while we sleep. If, however, they are not assisted by
their bodies in producing the effects in question, but frame such things in their own imaginative
faculty, and thus impress our imaginations, thereby giving visible form to what we dream; why is it,
I ask, that I cannot compel your imagination to reproduce those dreams which I have myself first
formed by my imagination? I have undoubtedly the faculty of imagination, and it is capable of
presenting to my own mind the picture of whatever I please; and yet I do not thereby cause any I
dream in you, although I see that even our bodies have the power of originating dreams in us. For by
means of the bond of sympathy uniting it to the soul, the body compels us in strange ways to repeat
or reproduce by imagination anything which it has once experienced. Thus often in sleep, if we are
thirsty, we dream that we drink; and if we are hungry, we seem to ourselves to be eating; and many
other instances there are in which, by some mode of exchange, so to speak, things are transferred
through the imagination from the body to the soul.</P>

<P>Be not surprised at the want of elegance and subtlety with which these questions are here stated
to you; consider the obscurity in which the subject is involved, and the inexperience of the writer;
be it yours to do your utmost to supply his deficiencies. </P>

  <UL><P><I>To Nebridius Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Although you know my mind well, you are perhaps not aware how much I long to enjoy your
society. This great blessing, however, God will some day bestow on me. I have read your letter, so
genuine in its utterances, in which you complain of your being in solitude, and, as it were, forsaken
by your friends, in whose society you found the sweetest charm of life. But what else can I suggest
to you than that which I am persuaded is already your exercise? Commune with your own soul, and raise
it up, as far as you are able, unto God. For in Him you hold us also by a firmer bond, not by means
of bodily images, which we must meanwhile be content to use in remembering each other, but by means
of that faculty of thought through which we realize the fact of our separation from each other.</P>

<P>2. In considering your letters, in answering all of which I have certainly had to answer questions
of no small difficulty and importance, I was not a little stunned by the one in which you ask me by
what means certain thoughts and dreams are put into our minds by higher powers or by superhuman
agents.<SUP><A HREF="#P2770_1036603">22</A></SUP> The question is a great one, and,
as your own prudence must convince you, would require, in order to its being satisfactorily answered,
not a mere letter, but a full oral discussion or a whole treatise. I shall try, however, knowing as I
do your talents, to throw out a few germs of thought which may shed light on this question, in order
that you may either complete the exhaustive treatment of the subject by your own efforts, or at least
not despair of the possibility of this important matter being investigated with satisfactory
results.</P>

<P>3. It is my opinion that every movement. of the mind affects in some degree the body. We know that
this is patent even to our senses, dull and sluggish though they are, when the movements of the mind
are somewhat vehement, as when we are angry, or sad, or joyful. Whence we may conjecture that, in
like manner, when thought is busy, although no bodily effect of the mental act is discernible by us,
there may be some such effect discernible by beings of a&euml;rial or etherial essence whose
perceptive faculty is in the highest degree acute,-so much so, that, in comparison with it, our
faculties are scarcely worthy to be called perceptive. Therefore these footprints of its motion, so
to speak, which the mind impresses on the body, may perchance not only remain, but remain as it were
with the force of a habit; and it may be that, when these are secretly stirred and played upon, they
bear thoughts and dreams into our minds, according to the pleasure of the person moving or touching
them: and this is done with marvellous facility. For if, as is manifest, the attainments of our
earth-born and sluggish bodies in the department of exercise, <I>e.g.</I> in the playing of musical
instruments, dancing on the tight-rope, etc., are almost incredible, it is by no means unreasonable
to suppose that beings which act with the powers of an a&euml;rial or etherial body upon our bodies,
and are by the constitution of their natures able to pass unhindered through these bodies, should be
capable of much greater quickness in moving whatever they wish, while we, though not perceiving what
they do, are nevertheless affected by the results of their activity. We have a somewhat parallel
instance in the fact that we do not perceive how it is that superfluity of bile impels us to more
frequent outbursts of passionate feeling; and yet it does produce this effect, while this superfluity
of bile is itself an effect of our yielding to such passionate feelings.</P>

<P>4. If, however, you hesitate to accept this example .as a parallel one, when it is thus cursorily
stated by me, turn it over in your thoughts as fully as you can. The mind, if it be continually
obstructed by some difficulty in the way of doing and accomplishing what it desires, is thereby made
continually angry. For anger, so far as I can judge of its nature, seems to me to be a tumultuous
eagerness to take out of the way those things which restrict our freedom of action. Hence it is that
usually we vent our anger not only on men, but on such a thing, for example, as the pen with which we
write, bruising or breaking it in our passion; and so does the gambler with his dice, the artist with
his pencil, and every man with the instrument which he may be using, if he thinks that he is in some
way thwarted by it. Now medical men themselves tell us that by these frequent fits of anger bile is
increased. But, on the other hand, when the bile is increased, we are easily, and almost without any
provocation whatever, made angry. Thus the effect which the mind has by its movement produced upon
the body, is capable in its turn of moving the mind again.</P>

<P>5. These things might be treated at very great length, and our knowledge of the subject might be
brought to greater certainty and fulness by a large induction from relevant facts. But take along
with this letter the one which I sent you lately concerning images and memory,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2774_1040534">23</A></SUP> and study it somewhat more carefully; for it was
manifest to me, from your reply, that it had not been fully understood. When, to the statements now
before you, you add the portion of that letter in which I spoke of a certain natural faculty whereby
the mind does in thought add to or take from any object as it pleases, you will see that it is
possible for us both in dreams and in waking thoughts to conceive the images of bodily forms which we
have never seen.</P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 389.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Nebridius Augustin Sends Greeting,</I></P>

</UL><P>1. No question of yours ever kept me so disturbed while reflecting upon it, as the remark
which I read in your last letter, in which you chide me for being indifferent as to making
arrangements by which it may be possible for us to live together. A grave charge, and one which, were
it not unfounded, would be most perilous. But since satisfactory masons seem to prove that we can
live as we would wish to do better here than at Carthage, or even in the country, I am wholly at a
loss, my dear Nebridius, what to do with you. Shall such a conveyance as may best suit your state of
health be sent from us to you? Our friend Lucinianus informs me that you can be carried without
injury in a palanquin. But I consider, on the other hand, how your mother, who could not bear your
absence from her when you were in health, will be much less able to bear it when you are ill. Shall I
myself then come to you? This I cannot do, for there are some here who cannot accompany me, and whom
I would think it a crime for me to leave. For you already can pass your time agreeably when left to
the resources of our own mind; but in their case the object of present efforts is that they may
attain to this. Shall I go and come frequently, and so be now with you, now with them? But this is
neither to live together, nor to live as we would wish to do. For the journey is not a short one, but
so great at least that the attempt to perform it frequently would prevent our gaining the wished-for
leisure. To this is added the bodily weakness through which, as you know, I cannot accomplish what I
wish, unless I cease wholly to wish what is beyond my strength.</P>

<P>2. To occupy one's thoughts throughout life with journeyings which you cannot perform tranquilly
and easily, is not the part of a man whose thoughts are engaged with that last journey which is
called death, and which alone, as you understand, really deserves serious consideration. God has
indeed granted to some few men whom He has ordained to bear rule over churches, the capacity of not
only awaiting calmly, but even desiring eagerly, that last journey, while at the same time they can
meet without disquietude the toils of those other journeyings; but I do not believe that either to
those who are urged to accept such duties through desire for worldly honour, or to those who,
although occupying a private station, covet a busy life, so great a boon is given as that amid bustle
and agitating meetings, and journeyings hither and thither, they should acquire that familiarity with
death which we seek: for both of these classes had it in their power to seek edification<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2781_1043693">24</A></SUP> in retirement. Or if this be not true, I am, I
shall not say the most foolish of all men, but at least the most indolent, since I find it
impossible, without the aid of such an interval of relief from care and toil, to taste and relish
that only real good. Believe me, there is need of much withdrawal of oneself from the tumult of the
things which are passing away, in order that there may be formed in man, not through insensibility,
not through presumption, not through vainglory, not through superstitious blindness, the ability to
say, "I fear nought." By this means also is attained that enduring joy with which no pleasurable
excitement found elsewhere is in any degree to be compared.</P>

<P>3. But if such a life does not fall to the lot of man, how is it that calmness of spirit is our
occasional experience? Wherefore is this experience more frequent, in proportion to the devotion with
which any one in his inmost soul worships God? Why does this tranquillity for the most part abide
with one in the business of life, when he goes forth to its duties from that sanctuary? Why are there
times in which, speaking, we do not fear death, and, silent, even desire it? I say to you-for I would
not say it to every one-to you whose visits to the upper world I know well, Will you, who have often
felt how sweetly the soul lives when it dies to all mere bodily affections, deny that it is possible
for the whole life of man to become at length so exempt from fear, that he may be justly called wise?
Or will you venture to affirm that this state of mind, on which reason leans has ever been your lot,
except when you were shut up to commune with your own heart? Since these things are so, you see that
it remains only for you to share with me the labour of devising how we may arrange to live together.
You know much better than I do what is to be done in regard to your mother, whom your brother Victor,
of course, does not leave alone. I will write no more, lest I turn your mind away from considering
this proposal.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Nebridius Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. When the question, which has long been brought before me by you with something even of
friendly chiding, as to the way in which we might live together, was seriously disturbing my mind,
and I had resolved to write to you, and to beg an answer from you bearing exclusively on this
subject, and to employ my pen on no other theme pertaining to our studies, in order that the
discussion of this matter between us might be brought to an end, the very short and indisputable
conclusion stated in your letter lately received at once delivered me from all further solicitude;
your statement being to the effect that on this matter there ought to be no further deliberation,
because as soon as it is in my power to come to you, or in your power to come to me, we shall feel
alike constrained to improve the opportunity. My mind being thus, as I have said, at rest, I looked
over all your letters, that I. might see what yet remained unanswered. In these I have found so many
questions, that even if they were easily solved, they would by their mere number more than exhaust
the time and talents of any man. But they are so difficult, that if the answering of even one of them
were laid upon me, I would not hesitate to confess myself heavily burdened. The design of this
introductory statement is to make you desist for a little from asking new questions until I am free
from debt, and that you confine yourself in your answer to the statement of your opinion of my
replies. At the same time, I know that it is to my own loss that I postpone for even a little while
the participation of your divine thoughts.</P>

<P>2. Hear, therefore, the view which I hold concerning the mystery of the Incarnation which the
religion wherein we have been instructed commends to our faith and knowledge as having been
accomplished in order to our salvation; which question I have chosen to discuss in preference to all
the rest, although it is not the most easily answered. For those questions which are proposed by you
concerning this world do not appear to me to have a sufficiently direct reference to the obtaining of
a happy life; and whatever pleasure they yield when investigated, there is reason to fear lest they
take up time which ought to be devoted to better things. With regard, then, to the subject which I
have at this time undertaken, first of all I am surprised that you were perplexed by the question why
not the! Father, but the Son, is said to have become incarnate, and yet were not also perplexed by
the same question in regard to the Holy Spirit. For the union of Persons in the Trinity is in the
Catholic faith set forth and believed, and by a few holy and blessed ones understood, to be so
inseparable, that whatever is done by the Trinity must be regarded as being done by the Father, and
by the Son, and by the Holy Spirit together; and that nothing is done by the Father which is, not
also done by the Son and by the Holy Spirit; and nothing done by the Holy Spirit which is not also
done by the Father and by the Son; and nothing done by the Son which is not also done by the Father
and by the Holy Spirit. From which it seems to follow as a consequence, that the whole Trinity
assumed human nature; for if the Son did so, but the Father and the Spirit did not, there is
something in which they act separately.<SUP><A HREF="#P2789_1049122">25</A></SUP>
Why, then, in our mysteries and sacred symbols, is the Incarnation ascribed only to the Son? This is
a very great question, So difficult, and on a subject so vast, that it is impossible either to give a
sufficiently clear statement, or to support it by satisfactory proofs. I venture, however, since I am
writing to you, to indicate rather than explain what my sentiments are, in order that you, from your
talents and our intimacy, through which you thoroughly know me, may for yourself fill up the
outline.</P>

<P>3. There is no nature, Nebridius-and, indeed, there is no substance-which does not contain in
itself and exhibit these three things: first, that it <I>is</I>; next, that it is <I>this</I> or
<I>that</I>; and third, that as far as possible it <I>remains</I> as it is. The first of these three
presents the original cause of nature from which all things exist; the second presents the
form<SUP><A HREF="#P2791_1050028">26</A></SUP> according to which all things are
fashioned and formed in a particular way; the third presents a certain permanence, so to speak, in
which all things are. Now, if it be possible that a thing can <I>be</I>, and yet not be <I>this</I>
or <I>that</I>, and not <I>remain</I> in its own generic form; or that a thing can be <I>this</I> or
<I>that</I>, and yet not <I>be</I>, and not <I>remain</I> in its own generic form, so far as it is
possible for it to do so; or that a thing can <I>remain</I> in its own generic form according to the
force belonging to it, and yet not <I>be</I>, and not be <I>this</I> or <I>that</I>,-then it is also
possible that in that Trinity one Person can do something in which the others have no part. But if
you see that whatever is must forthwith be <I>this</I> or <I>that</I>, and must <I>remain</I> so far
as possible in its own generic form, you see also that these Three do nothing in which all have not a
part. I see that as yet I have only treated a portion of this question, which makes its solution
difficult. But I wished to open up briefly to you-if, indeed, I have succeeded in this-how great in
the system of Catholic truth is the doctrine of the inseparability of the Persons of the Trinity, and
how difficult to be understood.</P>

<P>4. Hear now how that which disquiets your mind may disquiet it no more. The mode of existence
(Species-the second of the three above named) which is properly ascribed to the Son, has to do with
training, and with a certain art, if I may use that word in regard to such things, and with the
exercise of intellect, by which the mind itself is moulded in its thoughts upon things. Therefore,
since by that assumption of human nature the work accomplished was the effective presentation to us
of a certain training in the right way of living, and exemplification of that which is commanded,
under the majesty and perspicuousness of certain sentences, it is not without reason that all this is
ascribed to the Son. For in many things which I leave your own reflection and prudence to suggest,
although the constituent elements be many, some one nevertheless stands out above the rest, and
therefore not unreasonably claims a right of possession, as it were, of the whole for itself: as,
<I>e.g.</I>, in the. three kinds of questions above mentioned,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn27.htm#P2793_1052243">27</A></SUP> although the question raised be whether a thing
is or not, this involves necessarily also both <I>what</I> it is (this or that), for of course it
cannot <I>be</I> at all unless it be something, and whether it ought to be approved of or disapproved
of, for whatever <I>is</I> is a fit subject for some opinion as to its <I>quality</I>; in like
manner, when the question raised is <I>what</I> a thing is, this necessarily involves both that it
<I>is</I>, and that its quality may be tried by some standard; and in the same way, when the question
raised is what is the <I>quality</I> of a thing, this necessarily involves that that thing <I>is</I>,
and is <I>something</I>, since all things are inseparably joined to themselves;-nevertheless, the
question in each of the above cases takes its name not from all the three, but from the special point
towards which the inquirer directed his attention. Now there is a certain training necessary for men,
by which they might be instructed and formed after some model. We cannot say, however, regarding that
which is accomplished in men by this training, either that it does not exist, or that it is not a
thing to be desired [<I>i.e.</I> we cannot say <I>what</I> it is, without involving an affirmation
both of its <I>existence</I> and of its <I>quality</I>]; but we seek first to know <I>what</I> it is,
for in knowing this we know that by which we may infer that it is something, and in which we may
remain. Therefore the first thing necessary was, that a certain rule and pattern of training be
plainly exhibited; and this was done by the divinely appointed method of the Incarnation, which is
properly to be ascribed to the Son, in order that from it should follow both our knowledge, through
the Son, of the Father Himself, <I>i.e.</I> of the one first principle whence all things have their
being, and a certain inward and ineffable charm and sweetness of remaining in that knowledge, and of
despising all mortal things,-a gift and work which is properly ascribed to the Holy Spirit.
Wherefore, although in all things the Divine Persons act perfectly in common, and without possibility
of separation, nevertheless their operations behoved to be exhibited in such a way as to be
distinguished from each other, on account of the weakness which is in us, who have fallen from unity
into variety. For no one ever succeeds in raising another to the height on which he himself stands,
unless he stoop somewhat towards the level which that other occupies.</P>

<P>You have here a letter which may not indeed put an end to your disquietude in regard to this
doctrine, but which may set your own thoughts to work upon a kind of solid foundation; so that, with
the talents which I well know you to possess, you may follow, and, by the piety in which especially
we must be stedfast, may apprehend that which still remains to be discovered.</P>

</UL><P>1. I do not feel pleasure in writing of the subjects which I was wont to discuss; I am not at
liberty to write of new themes. I see that the one would not suit you, and that for the other I have
no leisure. For, since I left you, neither opportunity nor leisure has been given me for taking up
and revolving the things which we are accustomed to investigate together. The winter nights are
indeed too long, and they are not entirely spent in sleep by me; but when I have leisure, other
subjects [than those which we used to discuss] present themselves as having a prior claim on my
consideration.<SUP><A HREF="#P2804_1055787">28</A></SUP> What, then, am I to do? Am
I to be to you as one dumb, who cannot speak, or as one silent, who will not speak? Neither of these
things is desired, either by you or by me. Come, then, and bear what the end of the night succeeded
in eliciting from me during the time in which it was devoted to following out the subject of this
letter.</P>

<P>2. You cannot but remember that a question often agitated between us, and which kept us agitated,
breathless, and excited, was one concerning a body or kind of body, which belongs perpetually to the
soul, and which, as you recollect, is called by some its vehicle. It is manifest that this thing, if
it moves from place to place, is not cognisable by the understanding. But whatever is not cognisable
by the understanding cannot be understood. It is not, however, utterly impossible to form an opinion
approximating to the truth concerning a thing which is outside the province of the intellect, if it
lies within the province of the senses. But when a thing is beyond the province of the intellect and
of the senses, the speculations to which it gives rise are too baseless and trifling; and the thing
of which we treat now is of this nature, if indeed it exists. Why, then, I ask, do we not finally
dismiss this unimportant question, and with prayer to God raise ourselves to the supreme serenity of
the Highest existing nature?</P>

<P>3. Perhaps you may here reply: "Although bodies cannot be perceived by the understanding, we can
perceive with the understanding many things concerning material objects; <I>e.g.</I> we know that
matter exists. For who will deny this, or affirm that in this we have to do with the probable rather
than the true? Thus, though matter itself lies among things probable, it is a most indisputable truth
that something like it exists in nature. Matter itself is therefore pronounced to be an object
cognisable by the senses; but the assertion of its existence is pronounced to be a truth cognisable
by the intellect, for it cannot be perceived otherwise. And so this unknown body, about which we
inquire, upon which the soul depends for its power to move from place to place, may possibly be
cognisable by senses more powerful than we possess, though not by ours; and at all events, the
question whether it exists is one which may be solved by our understandings."</P>

<P>4. If you intend to say this, let me remind you that the mental act we call understanding is done
by us in two ways: either by the mind and reason within itself, as when we understand that the
intellect itself exists; or by occasion of suggestion from the senses, as in the case above
mentioned, when we understand that matter exists. In the first of these two kinds of acts we
understand through ourselves, <I>i.e.</I> by asking instruction of God concerning that which is
within us; but in the second we understand by asking instruction of God regarding that of which
intimation is given to us by the body and the senses. If these things be found true, no one can by
his understanding discover whether that body of which you speak exists or not, but the person to whom
his senses have given some intimation concerning it. If there be any living creature to which the
senses give such intimation, since we at least see plainly that we are not among the number, I regard
the conclusion established which I began to state a little ago, I that the question [about the
vehicle of the soul] is one which does not concern us. I wish you would consider this over and over
again, and take care to let me know the product of your consideration.</P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 389.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Nebridius Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I have preferred to reply to your last letter, not because I undervalued your earlier
questions, or enjoyed them less, but because in answering you I undertake a greater task than you
think. For although you enjoined me to send you a superlatively long<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2813_1059763">29</A></SUP> letter, I have not so much leisure as you
imagine, and as you know I have always wished to have, and do still wish. Ask not why it is so: for I
could more easily enumerate the things by which I am hindered, than explain why I am hindered by
them.</P>

<P>2. You ask why it is that you and I, though separate individuals, do many things which are the
same, but the sun does not the same as the other heavenly bodies. Of this thing I must attempt to
explain the cause. Now, if you and I do the same things, the sun also does many things which the
other heavenly bodies do: if in some things it does not the same as the others, this is equally true
of you and me. I walk, and you walk; it is moved, and they are moved: I keep awake, and you keep
awake; it shines, and they shine: I discuss, and you discuss; it goes its round, and they go their
rounds. And yet there is no fitness of comparison between mental acts and things visible. If,
however, as is reasonable, you compare mind with mind, the heavenly bodies, if they have any mind,
must be regarded as even more uniform than men in their thoughts or contemplations, or whatever term
may more conveniently express such activity in them. Moreover, as to the movements of the body, you
will find, if you reflect on this with your wonted attention, that it is impossible for precisely the
same thing to be done by two persons. When we walk together, do you think that we both necessarily do
the same thing? Far be such thought from one of your wisdom! For the one of us who walks on the side
towards the north, must either, in taking the same step as the other, get in advance of him, or walk
more slowly than he does. Neither of these things is perceptible by the senses; but you, if I am not
mistaken, look to what we know by the understanding rather than to what we learn by the senses. If,
however, we move from the pole towards the south, joined and clinging to each other as closely as
possible, and treading on a sheet of marble or even ivory smooth and level, a perfect identity is as
unattainable in our motions as in the throbbings of our pulses, or in our figures and faces. Put us
aside, and place in our stead the sons of Glaucus, and you gain nothing by this substitution: for
even in these twins so perfectly resembling each other, the necessity for the motions of each being
peculiarly his own, is as great as the necessity for their birth as separate individuals.</P>

<P>3. You will perhaps say: "The difference in this case is one which only reason can discover; but
the difference between the sun and the other heavenly bodies is to the senses also patent." If you
insist upon my looking to their difference in magnitude, you know how many things may be said as to
the distances by which they are removed from us, and into how great uncertainty that which you speak
of as obvious may thus be brought back. I may, however, concede that the actual size corresponds with
the apparent size of the heavenly bodies, for I myself believe this; and I ask you to show me any one
whose senses were incapable of remarking the prodigious stature of Naevius, exceeding by a foot that
of the tallest man.<SUP><A HREF="#P2816_1063051">30</A></SUP> By the way, I think
you have been just too eager to discover some man to match him; and when you did not succeed in the
search, have resolved to make me stretch out my letter so as to rival his dimensions.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2817_1063364">31</A></SUP> If therefore even on earth such variety in size
may be seen, I think that it need not surprise us to find the like in the heavens. If, however, the
thing which moves your surprise is that the light of no other heavenly body than the sun fills the
day, who, I ask you, has ever been manifested to men so great as that Man whom God took into union
with Himself, in another way entirely than He has taken all other holy and wise men who ever lived?
for if you compare Him with other men who were wise, He is separated from them by superiority greater
far than that which the sun has above the other heavenly bodies. This comparison let me charge you by
all means attentively to study; for it is not impossible that to your singularly gifted mind I may
have suggested, by this cursory remark, the solution of a question which you once proposed to me
concerning the humanity of Christ.</P>

<P>4. You also ask me whether that highest Truth and highest Wisdom and Form (or Archetype) of
things, by whom all things were made, and whom our creeds confess to be the only-begotten Son of God,
contains the idea<SUP><A HREF="#P2819_1064482">32</A></SUP> of mankind in general,
or also of each individual of our race. A great question. My opinion is, that in the creation of man
there was in Him the idea only of man generally, and not of you or me as individuals; but that in the
cycle of time the idea of each individual, with all the varieties distinguishing men from each other,
lives in that pure Truth. This I grant is very obscure; yet I know not by what kind of illustration
light may be shed upon it, unless perhaps we betake ourselves to those sciences which lie wholly
within our minds. In geometry, the idea of an angle is one thing, the idea of a square is another. As
often, therefore, as I please to describe an angle, the idea of the angle, and that alone, is present
to my mind; but I can never describe a square unless I fix my attention upon the idea of four angles
at the same time. In like manner, every man, considered as an individual man, has been made according
to one idea proper to himself; but in the making of a nation, although the idea according to which it
is made be also one, it is the idea not of one, but of many men collectively. If, therefore,
Nebridius is a part of this universe, as he is, and the whole universe is made up of parts, the God
who made the universe could not but have in His plan the idea of all the parts. Wherefore, since
there is in this idea of a very great number of men, it does not belong to man himself as such;
although, on the other hand, all the individuals are in wonderful ways reduced to one. But you will
consider this at your convenience. I beg you meanwhile to be content with what I have written,
although I have already outdone Naevius himself.</P>

</UL><P>1. This letter indicates a scarcity of paper,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2825_1066262">33</A></SUP> but not so as to testify that parchment is
plentiful here. My ivory tablets I used in the letter which I sent to your uncle. You will more
readily excuse this scrap of parchment, because what I wrote to him could not be delayed, and I
thought that not to write to you for want of better material would be most absurd. But if any tablets
of mine are with you, I request you to send them to meet a case of this kind.have written something,
as the Lord has deigned to enable me, concerning the Catholic religion, which before my coming I wish
to send to you, if my paper does not fail me in the meantime. For you will receive with indulgence
any kind of writing from the office of the brethren who are with me. As to the manuscripts of which
you speak, I have entirely forgotten them, except the books <I>de Oratore</I>; but I could not have
written anything better than that you should take such of them as you please, and I am still of the
same mind; for at this distance I know not what else I can do in the matter.</P>

<P>2. It gave me very great pleasure that in your last letter you desired to make me a sharer of your
joy at home; but</P>

    <UL><UL><P>"Wouldst thou have me forget how soon the deep,</P>

    <P>So tranquil now, may wear another face,</P>

HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2830_1067520">34</A></SUP> Yet I know you would not have me forget this, nor
are you yourself unmindful of it. Wherefore, if some leisure is granted you for more profound
meditation, improve this divine blessing. For when these things fall to our lot, we should not only
congratulate ourselves, but show! our gratitude to those to whom we owe them; for if in the
stewardship of temporal blessings we act in a manner that is just and kind, and with the moderation
and sobriety of spirit which befits the transient nature of these possessions,-if they are held by us
without laying hold on us, are multiplied without entangling us, and serve us without bringing us
into bondage,such conduct entitles us to the recompense of eternal blessings. For by Him who is the
Truth it was said: "If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give you
that. which is your own?" Let us therefore disengage ourselves from care about the passing things of
time; let us seek the blessings that are imperishable and sure: let us soar above our worldly
possessions. The bee does not the less need its wings when it has gathered an abundant store; for ff
it sink in the honey it dies.</P>

  <UL><P><I>From Maximus of Madaura to Augustin.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Desiring to be frequently made glad by communications from you, and by the stimulus of
your reasoning with which in a most pleasant way, and without violation of good feeling, you recently
attacked me, I have not forborne from replying to you in the same spirit, lest you should call my
silence an acknowledgment of being in the wrong. But I beg you to give these sentences an indulgent
kindly hearing, if you judge them to give evidence of the feebleness of old age.</P>

<P>Grecian mythology tells us, but without sufficient warrant for our believing the statement, that
Mount Olympus is the dwelling-place of the gods. But we actually see the market-place of our town
occupied by a crowd of beneficient deities; and we approve of this. Who could ever be so frantic and
infatuated as to deny that there is one supreme God, without beginning, without natural offspring,
who is, as it were, the great and mighty Father of all? The powers of this Deity, diffused throughout
the universe which He has made, we worship under many names, as we are all ignorant of His true name,
the name God<SUP><A HREF="#P2837_1069906">35</A></SUP> being common to all kinds of
religious belief. Thus it comes, that while in diverse supplications we approach separately, as it
were, certain parts of the Divine Being, we are seen in reality to be the worshippers of Him in whom
all these parts are one.</P>

<P>2. Such is the greatness of your delusion in another matter, that I cannot conceal the impatience
with which I regard it. For who can bear to find Mygdo honoured above that Jupiter who hurls the
thunderbolt; or (Sanae) above Juno, Minerva, Venus, and Vesta; or the arch-martyr Namphanio (oh
horror!) above all the immortal gods together? Among the immortals, Lucitas also is looked up to with
no less religious reverence, and others in an endless list (having names abhorred both by gods and by
men), who, when they met the ignominious end which their character and conduct had deserved, put the
crowning act upon their criminal career by affecting to die nobly in a good cause, though conscious
of the infamous deeds for which they were condemned. The tombs of these men (it is a folly almost
beneath our notice) are visited by crowds of simpletons, who forsake our temples and despise the
memory of their ancestors, so that the prediction of the indignant bard is notably fulfilled: "Rome
shall, in the temples of the gods, swear by the shades of men."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2839_1071226">36</A></SUP> To me it almost seems at this time as if a second
campaign of Actium had begun, in which Egyptian monsters, doomed soon to perish, dare to brandish
their weapons against the gods of the Romans.</P>

<P>3. But, O man of great wisdom, I beseech you, lay aside and reject for a little while the vigour
of your eloquence, which has made you everywhere renowned; lay down also the arguments of Chrysippus,
which you are accustomed to use in debate; leave for a brief season your logic, which aims in the
forthputting of its energies to leave nothing certain to any one; and show me plainly and actually
who is that God whom you Christians claim as belonging specially to you, and pretend to see present
among you in secret places. For it is in open day, before the eyes and ears of all men, that we
worship our gods with pious supplications, and propitiate them by acceptable sacrifices; and we take
pains that these things be seen and approved by all.</P>

<P>4. Being, however, infirm and old, I withdraw myself from further prosecution of this contest, and
willingly consent to the opinion of the rhetorician of Mantua, "Each one is drawn by that which
pleases himself best."<SUP><A HREF="#P2842_1072461">37</A></SUP> </P>

<P>After this, O excellent man, who hast turned aside from my faith, I have no doubt that this letter
will be stolen by some thief, and destroyed by fire or otherwise. Should this happen, the paper will
be lost, but not my letter, of which I will always retain a copy, accessible to all religious
persons. May you be preserved by the gods, through whom we all, who are mortals on the surface of
this earth, with apparent discord but real harmony, revere and worship Him who is the common Father
of the gods and of all mortals.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Maximus of Madaura.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Are we engaged in serious debate with each other, or is it your desire that we merely
amuse ourselves? For, from the language of your letter, I am at a loss to know whether it is due to
the weakness of your cause, or through the courteousness of your manners, that you have preferred to
show yourself more witty than weighty in argument. For, in the first place, a comparison was drawn by
you between Mount Olympus and your market-place, the reason for which I cannot divine, unless it was
in order to remind me that on the said mountain Jupiter pitched his camp when he was at war with his
father, as we are taught by history, which your religionists call sacred; and that in the said
market-place Mars is represented in two images, the one unarmed, the other armed, and that a statue
of a man placed over against these restrains with three extended fingers the fury of their demonship
from the injuries which he would willingly inflict on the citizens. Could I then ever believe that by
mentioning that market-place you intended to revive my recollection of such divinities, unless you
wished that we should pursue the discussion in a jocular spirit rather than in earnest? But in regard
to the sentence in which you said that such gods as these are members, so to speak, of the one great
God, I admonish you by all means, since you vouchsafe such an opinion, to abstain very carefully from
profane jestings of this kind. For if you speak of the One God, concerning whom learned and unlearned
are, as the ancients have said, agreed, do you affirm that those whose savage fury-or, if you prefer
it, whose power-the image of a dead man keeps in check are members of Him? I might say more on this
point, and your own judgment may show you how wide a door for the refutation of your views is here
thrown open. But I restrain myself, lest I should be thought by you to act more as a rhetorician than
as one earnestly defending truth.</P>

<P>2. As to your collecting of certain Carthaginian names of deceased persons, by which you think
reproach may be cast, in what seems to you a witty manner, against our religion, I do not know
whether I ought to answer this taunt, or to pass it by in silence. For if to your good sense these
things appear as trifling as they really are, I have not time to spare for such pleasantry. If,
however, they seem to you important, I am surprised that it did not occur to you, who are apt to be
disturbed by absurdly-sounding names, that your religionists have among their priests Eucaddires, and
among their deities, Abaddires. I do not suppose that these were absent from your mind when you were
writing, but that, with your courtesy and genial humour, you wished for the unbending of our minds,
to recall to our recollection what ludicrous things are in your superstition. For surely, considering
that you are an African, and that we are both settled in Africa, you could not have so forgotten
yourself when writing to Africans as to think that Punic names were a fit theme for censure. For if
we interpret the signification of these words, what else does Namphanio mean than "man of the good
foot," <I>i.e.</I> whose coming brings with it some good fortune, as we are wont to say of one whose
coming to us has been followed by some prosperous event, that he came with a lucky foot? And if the
Punic language is rejected by you, you virtually deny what has been admitted by most learned men,
that many things have been wisely preserved from oblivion in books written in the Punic tongue. Nay,
you ought even to be ashamed of having been born in the country in which the cradle of this language
is still warm, <I>i.e.</I> in which this language was originally, and until very recently, the
language of the people. If, however, it is not reasonable to take offence at the mere sound of names,
and you admit that I have given correctly the meaning of the one in question, you have reason for
being dissatisfied with your friend Virgil, who gives to your god Hercules an invitation to the
sacred rites celebrated by Evander in his honour, in these terms, "Come to us, and to these rites in
thine honour, with auspicious foot."<SUP><A HREF="#P2850_1077222">38</A></SUP> He
wishes him to come "with auspicious foot;" that is to say, he wishes Hercules to come as a Namphanio,
the name about which you are pleased to make much mirth at our expense. But if you have a penchant
for ridicule, you have among yourselves ample material for witticisms-the god Stercutius, the goddess
Cloacina, the Bald Venus, the gods Fear and Pallor, and the goddess Fever, and others of the same
kind without number, to whom the ancient Roman idolaters erected temples, and judged it right to
offer worship; which if you neglect, you are neglecting Roman gods, thereby making it manifest that
you are not thoroughly versed in the sacred rites of Rome; and yet you despise and pour contempt on
Punic names, as if you were a devotee at the altars of Roman deities.</P>

<P>3. In truth however, I believe that perhaps you do not value these sacred rites any more than we
do, but only take from them some unaccountable pleasure in your time of passing through this world:
for you have no hesitation about taking refuge under Virgil's wing, and defending yourself with a
line of his:</P>

<P>"Each one is drawn by that which pleases himself best."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2853_1078432">39</A></SUP> If, then, the authority of Maro pleases you, as
you indicate that it does, you will be pleased with. such lines as these: "First Saturn came from
lofty Olympus, fleeing before the arms of Jupiter, an exile bereft of his realms,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2854_1078697">40</A></SUP> -and other such statements, by which he aims at
making it understood that Saturn and your other gods like him were men. For he had read much history,
confirmed by ancient authority, which Cicero also had read, who makes the same statement in his
dialogues, in terms more explicit than we would venture to insist upon, and labours to bring it to
the knowledge of men so far as the times in which he lived permitted.</P>

<P>4. As to your statement, that your religious services are to be preferred to ours because you
worship the gods in public, but we use more retired places of meeting, let me first ask you how you
could have forgotten your Bacchus, whom you consider it right to exhibit only to the eyes of the few
who are initiated. You, however, think that, in making mention of the public celebration of your
sacred rites, you intended. only to make sure that we would place before our eyes the spectacle
presented by your magistrates and the chief men of the city when intoxicated and raging along your
streets; in which solemnity, if you are possessed by a god, you surely see of what nature he must be
who deprives men of their reason. If, however, this madness is only feigned, what say you to this
keeping of things hidden in a service which you boast of as public, or what good purpose is served by
so base an imposition? Moreover, why do you not foretell future events in your songs, if you are
endowed with the prophetic gift? or why do you rob the bystanders, if you are in your sound mind?</P>

<P>5. Since, then, you have recalled to our remembrance by your letter these and other things which I
think it better to pass over meanwhile, why may not we make sport of your gods, which, as every one
who knows your mind, and has read your letters, is well aware, are made sport of abundantly by
yourself? Therefore, if you wish us to discuss these subjects in a way becoming your years and
wisdom, and, in fact, as may be justly required of us, in connection with our purpose, by our dearest
friends, seek some topic worthy of being debated between us; and be careful to say on behalf of your
gods such things as may prevent us from supposing that you are intentionally betraying your own
cause, when we find you rather bringing to our remembrance things which may be said against them than
alleging anything in their defence. In conclusion, however, lest this should bc unknown to you, and
you might thus be brought unwittingly into jestings which are profane, let me assure you that by the
Christian Catholics (by whom a church has been set up in your own town also) no deceased person is
worshipped, and that nothing, in short, which has been made and fashioned by God is worshipped as a
divine power. This worship is rendered by them only to God Himself, who framed and fashioned all
things.<SUP><A HREF="#P2857_1081601">41</A></SUP> </P>

<P>These things shall be more fully treated of, with the help of the one true God, whenever I learn
that you are disposed to discuss them seriously.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Coelestinus Augustin Sends Greeting,</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Oh how I wish that I could continually say one thing to you! It is this: Let us shake off
the burden of unprofitable cares, and bear only those which are useful. For I do not know whether
anything like complete exemption from care is to be hoped for in this world. I wrote to you, but have
received no reply. I sent you as many of my books against the Manichaeans as I could send in a
finished and revised condition, and as yet nothing has been communicated to me as to the impression
they have made on your<SUP><A HREF="#P2864_1082600">42</A></SUP> judgment and
feelings. It is now a fitting opportunity for me to ask them back, and for you to return them. I beg
you therefore not to lose time in sending them, along with a letter from yourself, by which I eagerly
long to know what you are doing with them, or with what further help you think that you require still
to be furnished in order to assail that error with success. </P>

<P>2. As I know you well, I ask you to accept and ponder the following brief sentences on a great
theme. There is a nature which is susceptible of change with respect to both place and time, namely,
the corporeal. There is another nature which is in no way susceptible of change with respect to
place, but only with respect to time, namely, the spiritual. And there is a third Nature which can be
changed neither in respect to place nor in respect to time: that is, God. Those natures of which I
have said that they are mutable in some respect are called creatures; the Nature which is immutable
is called Creator. Seeing, however, that we affirm the existence of anything only in so far as it
continues and is one (in consequence of which, unity is the condition essential to beauty in every
form), you cannot fail to distinguish, in this classification of natures, which exists in the highest
possible manner; and which occupies the lowest place, yet is within the range of existence; and which
occupies the middle place, greater than the lowest, but coming short of the highest. That highest is
essential blessedness; the lowest, that which cannot be either blessed or wretched; and the
intermediate nature lives in wretchedness when it stoops towards..that which is lowest, and in
blessedness when it turns towards that which is highest. He who believes in Christ does not sink his
affections in that which is lowest, is not proudly self-sufficient in that which is intermediate, and
thus he is qualified for union and fellowship with that which is highest; and this is the sum of the
active life to which we are commanded, admonished, and by holy zeal impelled to aspire.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Gaius Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Words cannot express the pleasure with which the recollection of you filled my heart after
I parted with you, and has often filled my heart since then. For I remember that, notwithstanding the
amazing ardour which pervaded your inquiries after truth, the bounds of proper moderation in debate
were never transgressed by you. I shall not easily find any one who is more eager in putting
questions, and at the same time more patient in hearing answers, than you approved yourself. Gladly
therefore would I spend much time in converse with you; for the time thus spent, however much it
might be, would not seem long. But what avails it to discuss the hindrances on account of which it is
difficult for us to enjoy such converse? Enough that it is exceedingly difficult. Perhaps at some
future period it may be made very easy; may God grant this! Meanwhile it is otherwise. I have. given
to the brother by whom I have sent this letter the charge of submitting all my writings to your
eminent wisdom and charity, that they may be read by you. For nothing written by me will find in you
a reluctant reader; for I know the goodwill which you cherish towards me. Let me say, however, that
if, on reading these things, you approve of them, and perceive them to be true, you must not consider
them to be mine otherwise than as given to me; and you are at liberty to turn to that same source
whence proceeds also the power given you to appreciate their truth. For no one discerns the truth of
that which he reads from anything which is in the mere manuscript, or in the writer, but rather by
something within himself, if the light of truth, shining with a clearness beyond what is men's common
lot, and very far removed from the darkening influence of the body, has penetrated his own mind. If,
however, you discover some things which are false and deserve to be rejected, I would have you know
that these things have fallen as dew from the mists of human frailty, and these you are to reckon as
truly mine. I would exhort you to persevere in seeking the truth, were it not that I seem to see the
mouth of your heart already opened wide to drink it in. I would also exhort you to cling with manly
tenacity to the truth which you have learned, were it not that you already manifest in the clearest
manner that you possess strength of mind and fixedness of purpose. For all that lives within you has,
in the short time of our fellowship, revealed itself to me, almost as if the bodily veil had been
rent asunder. And surely the merciful providence of our God can in no wise permit a man so good and
so remarkably gifted as you are to be an alien from the flock of Christ.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Antoninus Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. As letters are due to you by two of us, a part of our debt is repaid with very abundant
usury when you see one of the two in person; and since by his voice you, as it were, hear my own, I
might have refrained from writing, had I .not been called to do it by the urgent request of the very
person whose journey to you seemed to me to make this unnecessary. Accordingly I now hold converse
with you even more satisfactorily than if I were personally with you, because you both read my
letter, and you listen to the words of one in whose heart you know that I dwell. I have with great
joy studied and pondered the letter sent by your Holiness, because it exhibits both your Christian
spirit unsullied by the guile of an evil age, and your heart full of kindly feeling towards
myself.</P>

<P>2. I congratulate you, and I give thanks to our God and Lord, because of the hope and faith and
love which are in you; and I thank you, in Him, for thinking so well of me as to believe me to be a
faithful servant of God, and for the love which with guileless heart you cherish towards that which
you commend in me; although, indeed, there is occasion rather for congratulation than for thanks in
acknowledging your goodwill in this thing. For it is profitable for: yourself that you should love
for its own sake that goodness which he of course loves who loves another because he believes him to
be good, whether that other be or be not what he is supposed to be. One error only is to be carefully
avoided in this matter, that we do not think otherwise than truth demands, not of the individual, but
of that which is true goodness in man. But, my brother well beloved, seeing that you are not in any
degree mistaken either in believing or in knowing that the great good for men is to serve God
cheerfully and purely, when you love any man because you believe him to share this good, you reap the
reward, even though the man be not what you suppose him to be. Wherefore it is fitting that you
should on this account be congratulated; but the person whom you love is to be congratulated, not
because of his being for that reason loved, but because of his being truly (if it is the case) such
an one as the person who for this reason loves him esteems him to be. As to our real character,
therefore, and as to the progress we may have made in the divine life, this is seen by Him whose
judgment, both as to that which is good in man, and as to each man's personal character, cannot err.
For your obtaining the reward of blessedness so far as this matter is concerned, it is sufficient
that you embrace me with your whole heart because you believe me to be such a servant of God as I
ought to be. To you, however, I also render many thanks for this, that you encourage me wonderfully
to aspire after such excellence, by your praising me as if I had already attained it. Many more
thanks still shall be yours, if you not only claim an interest in my prayers, but also cease not to
pray for me. For intercession on behalf of a brother is more acceptable to God when it is offered as
a sacrifice of love.</P>

<P>3. I greet very kindly your little son, and I pray that he may grow up in the way of obedience to
the salutary requirements of God's law. I desire and pray, moreover, that the one true faith and
worship, which alone is catholic, .may prosper and increase in your house; and if yore think any
labour on my part necessary for the promotion of this end, do not scruple to claim my service,
relying upon Him who is our common Lord, and upon the law of love which we must obey. This especially
would I recommend to your pious discretion, that by reading the word of God, and by serious
conversation with your partner,<SUP><A HREF="#P2878_1091211">43</A></SUP> you should
either plant the seed or foster the growth in her heart of an intelligent fear of God. For it is
scarcely possible that any one who is concerned for the soul's welfare, and is therefore without
prejudice resolved to know the will of the Lord, should fail, when enjoying the guidance of a good
instructor, to discern the difference which exists between every form of schism and the one Catholic
Church.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Lord Bishop Valerius, Most Blessed and Venerable, My Father Most Warmly Cherished
with True Love in the Sight of the Lord, Augustin, Presbyter, Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Before all things I ask your pious wisdom to take into consideration that, on the one
hand, if the duties of the office of a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, be discharged in a
perfunctory and time-serving manner, no work can be in this life more easy, agreeable, and likely to
secure the favour of men, especially in our day, but none at the same time more miserable,
deplorable, and worthy of condemnation in the sight of God; and, on the other hand, that if in the
office of bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, tim orders of the Captain of our salvation be observed,
there is no work in this life more difficult, toilsome, and hazardous, especially in our day, but
none at the same time more blessed in the sight of God.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2884_1092573">44</A></SUP> But what the proper mode of discharging these
duties is, I did not learn either in boyhood or in the earlier ),ears of manhood; and at the time
when I was beginning to learn it,.I was constrained as a just correction for my sins (for I know not
what else to think) to accept the second place at the helm, when as yet I knew not how to handle an
oar.</P>

<P>2. But I think that it was the purpose of my Lord hereby to rebuke me, because I presumed, as if
entitled by superior knowledge and excellence, to reprove the faults of many sailors before I had
learned by experience the nature of their work. Therefore, after I had been sent in among them to
share their labours, then I began to feel the rashness of my censures; although even before that time
I judged this office to be beset with many dangers. And hence the tears which some of my brethren
perceived me shedding in the city at the time of my ordination, and because of which they did their
utmost with the best intentions to console me, but with words which, through their not knowing the
causes of my sorrow, did not reach my case at all.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2886_1093772">45</A></SUP> But my experience has made me realize these
things much more both in degree and in measure than I had done in merely thinking of them: not that I
have now seen any new waves or storms of which I had not previous knowledge by observation, or
report, or reading, or meditation; but because I had not known my own skill or strength for avoiding
or encountering them, and had estimated it to be of some value instead of none. The Lord, however,
laughed at me, and was pleased to show me by actual experience. what I am.</P>

<P>3. But if He has done this not in judgment, but in mercy, as I confidently hope even now, when I
have learned my infirmity, my duty is to study with diligence all the remedies which the Scriptures
contain for such a case as mine, and to make it my business by prayer and reading to secure that my
soul be endued with the health and vigour necessary for labours so responsible. This I have not yet
done, because I have not had time; for I was ordained at the very time when I was thinking of having,
along with others, a season of freedom from all other occupation, that we might acquaint ourselves
with the divine Scriptures, and was intending to make such arrangements as would secure unbroken
leisure for this great work. Moreover, it is true that I did not at any earlier period know how great
was my unfitness for the arduous work which now disquiets and crushes my spirit. But if I have by
experience learned what is necessary for a man who ministers to a people in the divine sacraments and
word, only to find myself prevented from now obtaining what I have learned that I do not possess, do
you bid me perish, father Valerius? Where is your charity? Do you indeed love me? Do you indeed love
the Church to which you have appointed me, thus unqualified, to minister? I am well assured that you
love both; but you think me qualified, whilst I know myself better; and yet I would not have come to
know myself if I had not learned by experience.</P>

<P>4. Perhaps your Holiness replies: I wish to know what is lacking to fit you for your office. The
things which I lack are so many, that I could more easily enumerate the things which I have than
those which I desire to have. I may venture to say that I know and unreservedly believe the doctrines
pertaining to our salvation. But my difficulty is in the question how I am to use this truth in
ministering to the salvation of others, seeking what is profitable not for myself alone, but for
many, that they may be saved. And perhaps there may be, nay, beyond all question there are, written
in the sacred books, counsels by the knowledge and acceptance of which the man of God may so
discharge his duties to the Church in the things of God, or at least so keep a conscience void of
offence in the midst of ungodly men, whether living or dying, as to secure that that life for which
alone humble and meek Christian hearts sigh is not lost. But how can this be done, except, as the
Lord Himself tells us, by asking, seeking, knocking, that is, by praying, reading, and weeping? For
this I have by the brethren made the request, which in this petition I now renew, that a short time,
say till Easter, be granted me by your unfeigned and venerable charity.</P>

<P>5. For what shall I answer to the Lord my Judge? Shall I say, "I was not able to acquire the
things of which I stood in need, because I was engrossed wholly with the affairs of the Church "?
What if He thus reply: "Thou wicked servant, if property belonging to the Church (in the collection
of the fruits of which great labour is expended) were suffering loss under some oppressor, and it was
in thy power to do something in defence of her rights at the bar of an earthly judge, wouldst thou
not, leaving the field which I have watered with my blood, go to plead the cause with the consent of
all, and even with the urgent commands of some? And if the decision given were against the Church,
wouldst thou not, in prosecuting an appeal, go across the sea; and would no complaint be heard
summoning thee home from an absence of a year or more, because thy object was to prevent another from
taking possession of land required not for the souls, but for the bodies of the poor, whose hunger
might nevertheless be, satisfied in a way much easier and more acceptable to me by my living trees,
if these were cultivated with care? Wherefore, then, dost thou allege that thou hadst not time to
learn how to cultivate my field?" Tell me, I beseech you, what could I reply? Are you perchance
willing that I should say, "The aged Valerius is to blame; for, believing me to be instructed in all
things necessary, he declined, with a determination proportioned to his love for me, to give me
permission to learn what I had not acquired?"</P>

<P>6. Consider all these things, aged Valerius; consider them, I beseech you, by the goodness and
severity of Christ, by His mercy and judgment, by Him who has inspired you with such love for me that
I dare not displease you, even when the advantage of my soul is at stake. You, moreover, appeal to
God and to Christ to bear witness to me concerning your innocence and charity, and the sincere love
which you bear to me, just as if all these were not things about which I may myself willingly take my
oath. I therefore appeal to the love and affection which you have thus avouched. Have pity on me, and
grant me, for the purpose for which I have asked it, the time which I have asked; and help me with
your prayers, that my desire may not be in vain, and that my absence may not be without fruit to the
Church of Christ, and to the profit of my brethren and fellow-servants. I know that the Lord will not
despise your love interceding for me, especially in such a cause as this; and accepting it as a
sacrifice of sweet savour, He will restore me to you, perhaps, within a period shorter than I have
craved, thoroughly furnished for His service by the profitable counsels of His written word.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Bishop Aurelius, Augustin, Presbyter, Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. When, after long hesitation, I knew not how to frame a suitable reply to the letter of your
Holiness (for all attempts to express my feelings were baffled by the strength of affectionate
emotions which, rising spontaneously, were by the reading of your letter much more vehemently
inflamed), I cast myself at last upon God, that He might, according to my strength, so work in me
that I might address to you such an answer as should be suitable to the zeal for the Lord and the
care of His Church which we have in common, and in accordance with your dignity and the respect which
is due to you from me. And, first of all, as to your belief that you are aided by my prayers, I not
only do not decline this assurance, but I do even willingly accept it. For thus, though not through
my prayers, assuredly in yours, our Lord will hear me. As to your most benignant approval of the
conduct of brother Alypius in remaining in connection with us, to be an example to the brethren who
desire to withdraw themselves from this world's cares, I thank you more warmly than words can
declare. May the Lord recompense this to your own soul! The whole company, therefore, of brethren
which has begun to grow up together beside me, is bound to you by gratitude for this great favour; in
bestowing which, you, being far separated from us only by distance on the surface of the earth, have
consulted our interest as one in spirit very near to us. Wherefore, to the utmost of our power we
give ourselves to prayer that the Lord may be pleased to uphold along with you the flock which has
been committed to you, and may never anywhere forsake you, but be present as your help in all times
of need, showing in His dealings with His Church, through your discharge of priestly functions, such
mercy as spiritual men with tears and groanings implore Him to manifest.</P>

<P>2. Know, therefore, most blessed lord, venerable for the superlative fulness of your charity, that
I do not despair, but rather cherish lively hope that, by means of that authority which you wield,
and which, as we trust, has been committed to your spirit, not to your flesh alone, our Lord and God
may be able, through the respect due to councils<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2898_1102124">46</A></SUP> and to yourself, to bring healing to the many
carnal blemishes and disorders which the African Church is suffering in the conduct of many, and is
bewailing in the sorrow of a few of her members. For whereas.the apostle had in one passage briefly
set forth as fit to be hated and avoided three classes of vices, from which there springs an
innumerable crop of vicious courses, only one of these-that, namely, which he has placed second-is
very strictly punished by the Church; but the other two, viz. the first and third, appear to be
tolerable in the estimation of men, and so it may gradually come to lass that they shall even cease
to be regarded as vices. The words of the chosen vessel are these: "Not in rioting and drunkenness,
not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying: but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2899_1103101">47</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3. Of these three, then, chambering and wantonness are regarded as crimes so great, that any one
stained with these sins is deemed unworthy not merely of holding office in the Church, but also of
participation in the sacraments; and rightly so. But why restrict such censure to this form of sin
alone? For rioting and drunkenness are so tolerated and allowed by public opinion, that even in
services designed to honour the memory of the blessed martyrs, and this not only on the annual
festivals (which itself must be regarded as deplorable by every one who looks with a spiritual eye
upon these things), but every day, they are openly practised. Were this corrupt practice
objectionable only because of its being disgraceful, and not on the ground of impiety, we might
consider it as a scandal to be tolerated with such amount of forbearance as is within our power. And
yet, even in that case, what are we to make of the fact that, when the same apostle had given a long
list of vices, among which he mentioned drunkenness, he concluded with the warning that we should not
even eat bread with those who are guilty of such things?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2901_1104257">48</A></SUP> But let us, if it must be so, bear with these
things in the luxury and disorder of families, and of those convivial meetings which are held within
the walls of private houses; and let us take the body of Christ in communion with those with whom we
are forbidden to eat even the bread which sustains our bodies; but at least let this outrageous
insult be kept far away from the tombs of the sainted dead, from the scenes of sacramental privilege,
and from the houses of prayer. For who may venture to forbid in private life excesses which, when
they. are practised by crowds in holy places, are called an honouring of the martyrs?</P>

<P>4. If Africa were the first country in which an attempt were made to put down these things, her
example would deserve to be esteemed worthy of imitation by all other countries;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2903_1105082">49</A></SUP> but when, both throughout the greater part of
Italy and in all or almost all the churches beyond the sea, these practices either, as in some
places, never existed, or, as in other places where they did exist, have been, whether they were
recent or of long standing, rooted out and put down by the diligence and the censures of bishops who
were holy men, entertaining true views concerning the life to come;-when this, I say, is the case, do
we hesitate as to the possibility of removing this monstrous defect in our morals, after an example
has been set before us in so many lands? Moreover, we have as our bishop a man belonging to those
parts, for which we give thanks earnestly to God; although he is a man of such moderation and
gentleness, in fine, of such prudence and zeal in the Lord, that even had he been a native of Africa,
the persuasion would have been wrought in him by the Scriptures, that a remedy must be applied to the
wound which this loose and disorderly custom has inflicted. But so wide and deep is the plague caused
by this wickedness, that, in my opinion, it cannot be completely cured without interposition of a
council's authority. If, however, a beginning is to be made by one church, it seems to me, that as it
would be presumptuous for any other church to attempt to change what the Church of Carthage still
maintained, so would it also be the height of effrontery for any other to wish to persevere in a
course which the Church of Carthage had condemned. And for such a reform in Carthage, what better
bishop could be desired than the prelate who, while he was a deacon, solemnly denounced these
practices?</P>

<P>5. But that over which you then sorrowed you ought now to suppress, not harshly, but as it is
written, "in the spirit of meekness."<SUP><A HREF="#P2905_1106986">50</A></SUP>
Pardon my boldness, for your letter revealing to me your true brotherly love gives me such
confidence, that I am encouraged to speak as freely to you as I would to myself. These offences are
taken out of the way, at least in my judgment, by other methods than harshness, severity, and an
imperious mode of dealing,-namely, rather by teaching than by commanding, rather by advice than by
denunciation.<SUP><A HREF="#P2906_1107404">51</A></SUP> Thus at least we must deal
with the multitude; in regard to the sins of a few, exemplary severity must be used. And if we do
employ threats, let this be done sorrowfully, supporting our threatenings of coming judgment by the
texts of Scripture, so that the fear which men feel through our words may be not of us in our own
authority, but of God Himself. Thus an impression shall be made in the first place upon those who are
spiritual, or who are nearest to that state of mind; and then by means of the most gentle, but at the
same time most importunate exhortations, the opposition of the rest of the multitude shall be broken
down.<SUP><A HREF="#P2907_1108071">52</A></SUP> </P>

<P>6. Since, however, these drunken revels and luxurious feasts in the cemeteries are wont to be
regarded by the ignorant and carnal multitude as not only an honour to the martyrs, but also a solace
to the dead, it appears to me that they might be more easily dissuaded from such scandalous and
unworthy practices in these places, if, besides showing that they are forbidden by Scripture, we take
care, in regard to the offerings for the spirits of those who sleep, which indeed we are bound to
believe to be of some use, that they be not sumptuous beyond what is becoming respect for the memory
of the departed, and that they be distributed without ostentation, and cheerfully to all who ask a
share of them; also that they be not sold, but that if any one desires to offer any money as a
religious act, it be given on the spot to the poor. Thus the appearance of neglecting the memory of
their deceased friends, which might cause them no small sorrow of heart, shall be avoided, and that
which is a pious and honourable act of religious service shall be celebrated as it should be in the
Church. This may suffice meanwhile in regard to rioting and drunkenness.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>7. As to "strife and deceit,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2911_1109384">53</A></SUP> what
right have I to speak, seeing that these vices prevail more seriously among our own order than among
our congregations? Let me, however, say that the source of these evils is pride, and a desire for the
praises of men, which also frequently produces hypocrisy. This is successfully resisted only by him
who is penetrated with love and fear of God, through the multiplied declarations of the divine books;
provided, however, that such a man exhibit in himself a pattern both of patience and of humility, by
assuming as his due less praise and honour than is offered to him: at the same time neither accepting
all nor refusing all that is rendered to him by those who honour him; and as to the portion which he
does accept, receiving it not for his own sake, seeing that he ought to live wholly in the sight of
God and to despise human applause, but for the sake of those whose welfare he cannot promote if by
too great self-abasement he lose his place in their esteem. For to this pertains that word, "Let no
man despise thy youth;"<SUP><A HREF="#P2912_1110510">54</A></SUP> while he who said
this says also in another place, "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
Christ."<SUP><A HREF="#P2913_1110644">55</A></SUP> </P>

<P>8. It is a great matter not to exult in the honours and praises which come from men, but to reject
all vain pomp; and, if some of this be necessary, to make whatever is thus retained contribute to the
benefit and salvation of those who confer the honour. For it has not been said in vain, "God will
break the bones of those who seek to please men."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2915_1111011">56</A></SUP> For what could be feebler. what more destitute of
the firmness and strength which the bones here spoken of figuratively represent, than the man who is
prostrated by the tongue of slanderers, although he knows that the things spoken against him are
false? The pain arising from this thing would in no wise rend the bowels of his soul, if its bones
had not been broken by the love of praise. I take for granted your strength of mind: therefore it is
to myself that I say those things which I am now stating to you. Nevertheless you are willing, I
believe, to consider along with me how important and how difficult these things are. For the man who
has not declared war against this enemy has no idea of its power; for if it be comparatively easy to
dispense with praise so long as it is denied to him, it is difficult to forbear from being captivated
with praise when it is offered. And yet the hanging of our minds upon God ought to be so great, that
we would at once correct those with whom we may take that liberty, when we are by them undeservedly
praised, so as to prevent them from either thinking us to possess what is not in us, or regarding
that as ours which belongs to God, or commending us for things which, though we have them, and
perhaps have them in abundance, are nevertheless in their nature not worthy of commendation, such as
are all those good things which we have in common with the lower animals or with wicked men. If,
however, we are deservedly praised on account of what God has given us, let us congratulate those to
whom what is really good yields pleasure; but let us not congratulate ourselves on the fact of our
pleasing men, but on the fact of our being (if it is the case) such in the sight of God as we are in
their esteem, and because praise is given not to us, but to God, who is the giver of all things which
are truly and justly praised. These things are daily repeated to me by myself, or rather by Him from
whom proceed all profitable instructions, whether they are found in the reading of the divine word or
are suggested from within to the mind; and yet, although strenuously contending with my adversary, I
often receive wounds from him when I am unable to put away from myself the fascinating power of the
praise which is offered to me.</P>

<P>9. These things I have written, in order that, if they are not now necessary for your Holiness
(your own thoughts suggesting to you other and more useful considerations of this kind, or your
Holiness being above the need of such remedies), my disorders at least may be known to you, and you
may know that which may move you to deign to plead with God for me as my infirmity demands: and I
beseech you, by the humanity of Him who hath commanded us to bear each other's burdens, that you
offer such intercession most importunately on my behalf. There are many things in regard to my life
and conversation, of which I will not write, which I would confess with tears if we were so situated
that nothing was required but my mouth and your ears as the means of communication between my heart
and your heart. If, however, the aged Saturninus, venerated by us and beloved by all here with
unreserved and unfeigned affection, whose brotherly love and devotion to you I observed when I was
with you,-if he, I say, is pleased to visit us so soon as he finds it convenient, whatever converse
we may be able to enjoy with that holy and spiritually-minded man shall be esteemed by us very
little, if at all, different from personal conference with your Excellency. With entreaties too
earnest for words to express their urgency, I beg you to condescend to join us in asking and
obtaining from him this favour. For the people of Hippo fear much, and far more than they ought, to
let me go to so great a distance from them, and will on no account trust me by myself so far as to
permit me to see the field given by your care and generosity to the brethren, of which, before your
letter came, we had heard through our brother and fellow-servant Parthenius, from whom we have also
learned many other things which we longed to know. The Lord will accomplish the fulfilment of all the
other things which we still desiderate. </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2918_1115218"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XXIII.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 392.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Maximin, My Well-Beloved Lord and Brother, Worthy of Honour, Augustin, Presbyter of
the Catholic Church, Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Before entering on the subject on which I have resolved to write to your Grace, I shall
briefly state my reasons for the terms used in the title of this letter, test these should surprise
either yourself or any other person. I have written "to my lord," because it is written: "Brethren,
ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love
serve one another."<SUP><A HREF="#P2922_1115786">57</A></SUP> Seeing, therefore,
that in this duty of writing to you I am actually by love serving you, I do only what is reasonable
in calling you "my lord," for the sake of that one true Lord who gave us this command. Again, as to
my having written "well-beloved," God knoweth that I not only love you, but love you as I love
myself; for I am well aware that I desire for you the very blessings which I am fain to make my own.
As to my adding the words "worthy of honour," I did not mean, by adding this, to say that I honour
your episcopal office, for to me you are not a bishop; and this I trust you will take as spoken with
no intention to give offence, but from the conviction that in our mouth Yea should be Yea, and Nay,
Nay: for neither you nor any one who knows us can fail to know that you are not my bishop, and, I am
not your presbyter. "Worthy of honour" I therefore willingly call you on this ground, that I know you
to be a man; and I know that man was made in the image and likeness of God, and is placed in honour
by the very order and law of nature, if by understanding the things which he ought to understand he
retain his honour. For it is written, "Man being placed in honour did not understand: he is compared
to the brutes devoid of reason, and is made like unto them."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2923_1117082">58</A></SUP> Why then may I not address you as worthy of
honour, inasmuch as you are a man, especially since I dare not despair of your repentance and
salvation so long as you are in this life? Moreover, as to my calling you "brother," you are well
acquainted with the precept divinely given to us, according to which we are to say, "Ye are our
brethren," even to those who deny that they are our brethren; and this has much to do with the reason
which has made me resolve to write to you, my brother. Now that the reason for my making such an
introduction to my letter has been given, I bespeak your calm attention to what follows.</P>

<P>2. When I was in your district, and was with all my power expressing my abhorrence of the sad and
deplorable custom followed by men who, though they boast of the name of Christians, do not hesitate
to rebaptize Christians, there were not wanting some who said in praise of you, that you do not
conform to this custom. I confess that at first I did not believe them; but afterwards, considering
that it was possible for the fear of God to take possession of a human soul exercised in meditation
upon the life to come, in such a way as to restrain a man from most manifest wickedness, I believed
their statement, rejoicing that by holding such a resolution you showed yourself averse to complete
alienation from the Catholic Church. I was even on the outlook for an opportunity of conversing with
you, in order that, if it were possible, the small difference which still remained between us might
be taken away, when, behold, a few days ago it was reported to me that you had rebaptized a deacon of
ours belonging to Mutugenna! I was deeply grieved both for his melancholy fall and for your sin, my
brother, which surprised and disappointed me. For I know what the Catholic Church is, The nations are
Christ's inheritance, and the ends of the earth are His possession. You also know what the Catholic
Church is; or if you do not know it, apply your attention to discern it, for it may be very easily
known by those who are willing to be taught. Therefore, to rebaptize even a heretic who has received
in baptism the seal of holiness which the practice<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2925_1119291">59</A></SUP> of the Christian Church has transmitted to us, is
unquestionably a sin; but to rebaptize a Catholic is one of the worst of crimes. As I did not,
however, believe the report, because I still retained my favourable impression of you, I went in
person to Mutugenna. The miserable man himself I did not succeed in finding, but I learned from his
parents that he had been made one of your deacons. Nevertheless I still think so favourably of you,
that I will not believe that he has been rebaptized.</P>

<P>3. Wherefore, my beloved brother, I beseech you, by the divine and human natures of our Lord Jesus
Christ, have the kindness to reply to this letter, telling me what has been done, and [so to write as
knowing that I intend to read your letter aloud to our brethren in the church. This I have written,
lest, by afterwards doing that which you did not expect me to do, I should give offence to your
Charity, and give you occasion for making a just complaint against me to our common friends. What can
reasonably prevent you from answering this letter I do not see. For if you do rebaptize, you have
nothing to apprehend from your colleagues when you write that you are doing that which they would
command you to do even if you were unwilling; and if you, moreover, defend this by the best arguments
known to you, as a thing which ought to be done, your colleagues, so far from being displeased on
this account, will praise you. But if you do not rebaptize, hold fast your Christian liberty, my
brother Max;rain; hold it fast, I implore you: fixing your eye on Christ, fear not the censure,
tremble not before the power of any man. Fleeting is the honour of this world, and fleeting are all
the objects to which earthly ambition aspires. Neither thrones ascended by flights of steps,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2927_1121085">60</A></SUP> nor canopied pulpits,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2928_1121131">61</A></SUP> nor processions and chantings of crowds of
consecrated virgins, shall be admitted as available for the defence of those who have now these
honours, when at the judgment-seat of Christ conscience shall beg.in to lift its accusing voice, and
He who is the Judge of the consciences of men shall pronounce the final sentence. What is here
esteemed an honour shall then be a burden: what uplifts men here, shall weigh heavily on them in that
day. Those things which meanwhile are done for the Church's welfare as tokens of respect to us, shall
then be vindicated, it may be, by a conscience void of offence; but they will avail nothing as a
screen for a guilty conscience.</P>

<P>4. If, then, it be indeed the case that, under the promptings of a devout and pious mind, you
abstain from dispensing a second baptism, and rather accept the baptism of the Catholic Church as the
act of the one true Mother, who to all nations both offers a welcome to her bosom, that they may be
regenerated, and gives a mother's nourishment to them when they are regenerated, and as the token of
admission into Christ's one possession, which reaches to the ends of the earth; if, I say, you indeed
do this, why do you not break forth into a joyful and independent confession of your sentiments? Why
do you hide under a bushel the lamp which might so profitably shine? Why do you not rend and cast
from you the old sordid livery of your craven-hearted bondage, and go forth clad in the panoply of
Christian boldness, saying, "I know but one baptism consecrated and sealed with the name of the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost: this sacrament, wherever I find it, I am bound to
acknowledge and approve; I do not destroy what I discern to be my Lord's; I do not treat with
dishonour the banner of my King"? Even the men who parted the raiment of Christ among them did not
rudely rend in pieces the seamless robe;<SUP><A HREF="#P2930_1123041">62</A></SUP>
and they were men who had not then any faith in Christ's resurrection; nay, they were witnessing His
death. If, then, persecutors forbore from rending the vesture of Christ when He was hanging upon the
cross, why should Christians destroy the sacrament of His institution now when He is sitting in
heaven upon His throne? Had I been a Jew in the time of that ancient people, when there was nothing
better that I could be, I would undoubtedly have received circumcision. That "seal of the
righteousness which is by faith" was of so great importance in that dispensation before it was
abrogated<SUP><A HREF="#P2931_1123654">63</A></SUP> by the Lord's coming, that the
angel would have strangled the infant-child of Moses, had not the child's mother, seizing a stone,
circumcised the child, and by this sacrament averted impending death.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2932_1123873">64</A></SUP> This sacrament also arrested the waters of the
Jordan, and made them flow back towards their source. This sacrament the Lord Himself received in
infancy, although He abrogated it when He was crucified. For these signs of spiritual blessings were
not condemned, but gave place to others which were more suitable to the later dispensation. For as
circumcision was abolished by the first coming of the Lord, so baptism shall be abolished by His
second coming. For as now, since the liberty of faith has come, and the yoke of bondage has been
removed, no Christian receives circumcision in the flesh; so then, when the just are reigning with
the Lord, and the wicked have been condemned, no one shall be baptized, but the reality which both
ordinances prefigure-namely, circumcision of the heart and cleansing of the conscience-shall be
eternally abiding. If, therefore, I had been a Jew in the time of the former dispensation, and there
had come to me a Samaritan who was willing to become a Jew, abandoning the error which the Lord
Himself condemned when He said, "Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship, for salvation
is of the Jews;"<SUP><A HREF="#P2933_1125199">65</A></SUP> -if, I say, a Samaritan
whom Samaritans had circumcised had expressed his willingness to become a Jew, there would have been
no scope for the boldness which would have insisted on the repetition of the rite; and instead of
this, we would have been compelled to approve of that which God had commanded, although it had been
done by heretics. But if, in the flesh of a circumcised man, I could not find place for the
repetition of the circumcision, because there is but one member which is circumcised, much less is
place found in the one heart of man for the repetition of the baptism of Christ. Ye, therefore, who
wish to baptize twice, must seek as subjects of such double baptism men who have double hearts. </P>

<P>5. Publish frankly, therefore, that you are doing what is right, if it be the case that you do not
rebaptize; and write me to that effect, not only without fear, but with joy. Let no Councils of your
party deter you, my brother, from this step: for if this displease them, they are not worthy to have
you among them; but if it please them, we trust that there shall soon be peace between you and us,
through the mercy of our Lord, who never forsakes those who fear to displease Him, and who labour to
do what is acceptable in His sight; and let not our honours-a dangerous burden, of which an account
must yet be given-be a hindrance, making it unhappily impossible for our people who believe in
Christ, and who share with one another in daily bread at home, to sit down at the same table of
Christ. Do we not grievously lament that husband and wife do in most cases, when marriage makes them
one flesh, vow mutual fidelity in the name of Christ, and yet rend asunder Christ's own body by
belonging to separate communions? If, by your moderate measures and wisdom, and by your exercise of
that love which we all owe to Him who shed His blood for us, this schism, which is such a grievous
scandal, causing Satan to triumph and many souls to perish, be taken out of the way in these parts,
who can adequately express how illustrious is the reward which the Lord prepares for you, in that
from you should proceed an example which, if imitated, as it may so easily be, would bring health to
all His other members, which throughout the whole of Africa are lying now miserably exhausted? How
much I fear lest, since you cannot see my heart, I appear to you to speak rather in irony than in the
sincerity of love! But what more can I do than present my words before your eye, and my heart before
God?</P>

<P>6. Let us put away from between us those vain objections which are wont to be thrown at each other
by the ignorant on either side. Do not on your part cast up to me the persecutions of Macarius. I, on
mine, will not reproach you with the excesses of the Circumcelliones. If you are not to blame for the
latter, neither am I for the former; they pertain not to us. The: Lord's floor is not yet purged-it
cannot be! without chaff; be it ours to pray, and to do what in us lies that we may be good grain. I
could not pass over in silence the rebaptizing of our deacon; for I know how much harm my silence
might do to myself. For I do not propose to spend my time in the empty enjoyment of ecclesiastical
dignity; but I propose to act as mindful of this, that to the one Chief Shepherd I must give account
of the sheep committed unto me. If you would rather that I should not thus write to you, you must, my
brother, excuse me on the ground of my fears; for I do fear greatly, lest, if I were silent and
concealed my sentiments, others might be rebaptized by you. I have resolved, therefore, with such
strength and opportunity as the Lord may grant, so to manage this discussion, that by our peaceful
conferences, all who belong to our communion may know how far apart from heresy and schism is the
position of the Catholic Church, and with what care they should guard against the destruction which
awaits the tares and the branches cut off from the Lord's vine. If you willingly accede to such
conference with me, by consenting to the public reading of the letters of both, I shall unspeakably
rejoice. If this proposal is displeasing to you, what can I do, my brother, but read our letters,
even without your consent, to the Catholic congregation, with a view to its instruction? But if you
do not condescend to write me a reply, I am resolved at least to read my own letter, that, when your
misgivings as to your procedure are known, others may be ashamed to be rebaptized.</P>

<P>7. I shall not, however, do this in the presence of the soldiery, lest any of you should think
that I wish to act in a violent way, rather than as the interests of peace demand; but only after
their departure, that all who hear me may understand, that I do not propose to compel men to embrace
the communion of any party, but desire the truth to be made known to persons who, in their search for
it, are free from disquieting apprehensions. On our side there shall be no appeal to men's fear of
the civil power on your side, let there be no intimidation by a mob of Circumcelliones. Let us attend
to the real matter in debate, and let our arguments appeal to reason and to the authoritative
teaching of the Divine Scriptures, dispassionately and calmly, so far as we are able; let us ask,
seek, and knock, that we may receive and find, and that to us the door may be opened, and thereby may
be achieved, by God's blessing on our united efforts and prayers, the first towards the entire
removal from our district of that impiety which is such a disgrace to Africa. If you do not believe
that I am willing to postpone the discussion until after the soldiery have left, you may delay your
answer until they have gone; and if, while they are still here, I should wish to read my own letter
to the people, the production of the letter will of itself convict me of breaking my word. May the
Lord in His mercy prevent me from acting in a way so contrary to morality, and to the good
resolutions with which, by laying His yoke on me, He has been pleased to inspire me!</P>

<P>8. My bishop would perhaps have preferred to send a letter himself to your Grace, if he had been
here; or my letter would have been written, if not by his order, at least with his sanction. But in
his absence, seeing that the rebaptizing of this deacon is said to have occurred recently, I have not
by delay allowed the feelings caused by the action to cool down, being moved by the promptings of the
keenest anguish on account of what I regard as really the death of a brother. This my grief the
compensating joy of reconciliation between us and you may perhaps be appointed to heal, through the
help of the mercy and providence of our Lord. May the Lord our God grant thee a calm and conciliatory
spirit, my dearly beloved lord and brother!</P>

</UL><P>This letter, written in 394 to Alypius by Paulinus, owes its place in the collection of
Augustin's letters to the notice of the treatises written by Augustin against the Manichaeans, and
its connection with the following letter addressed by Paulinus to Augustin himself. It is obviously
one of those which, in making a selection of letters, may be safely omitted.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2942_1132369"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XXV.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 394.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Augustin, Our Lord and Brother Beloved and Venerable, from Paulinus and Therasia,
Sinners.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. The love of Christ which constrains us, and which unites us, though separated by distance,
in the bond of a common faith, has itself! emboldened me to dismiss my fear and address a letter to
you; and it has given you a place in my inmost heart by means of your writings-so full of the stores
of learning, so sweet with celestial honey, the medicine and the nourishment of my soul. These I at
present have in. five books, which, through the kindness of our blessed and venerable Bishop Alypius,
I received, not only as a means of my own instruction, but. for the use of the Church in many towns.
These books I am now reading: in them I take great delight: in them I find food, not that which
perisheth, but that which imparts the substance! of eternal life through our faith, whereby we are in
our Lord Jesus Christ made members of His body; for the writings and examples of the faithful do
greatly strengthen that faith which, not looking at things seen, longs after things not seen with
that love which accepts implicitly all things which are according to the truth of the omnipotent God.
O true salt of the earth, by which our hearts are preserved from being corrupted by the errors of the
world! O light worthy of your place on the candlestick of the Church, diffusing widely in the
Catholic towns the brightness of a flame fed by the oil of the seven-branched lamp of the upper
sanctuary, you also disperse even the thick mists of heresy, and rescue the light of truth from the
confusion of darkness by the beams of your luminous demonstrations.</P>

<P>2. You see, my brother beloved, esteemed, and welcomed in Christ our Lord, with what intimacy I
claim to know you, with what amazement I admire and with what love I embrace you, seeing that I enjoy
daily converse with you by the medium of your writings, and am fed by the breath of your mouth. For
your mouth I may justly call a pipe conveying living water, and a channel from the eternal fountain;
for Christ has become in you a fountain of "living water springing up into eternal life."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2947_1134526">66</A></SUP> Through desire for this my soul thirsted within
me, and my parched ground longed to be flooded with the fulness of your river. Since, therefore, you
have armed me completely by this your Pentateuch against the Manichaeans, if you have prepared any
treatises in defence of the Catholic faith against other enemies (for our enemy, with his thousand
pernicious stratagems, must be defeated by weapons as various as the artifices by which he assails
us), I beg you to bring these forth from your armoury for me, and not refuse to furnish me with the
"armour of righteousness." For I am oppressed even now in my work with a heavy burden, being, as a
sinner, a veteran in the ranks of sinners, but an untrained recruit in the service of the King
eternal. The wisdom of this world I have unhappily hitherto regarded with admiration, and, devoting
myself to literature which I now see to be unprofitable, and wisdom which I now reject, I was in the
sight of God foolish and dumb. When I had become old in the fellowship of my enemies, and had
laboured in vain in my thoughts, I lifted mine eyes to the mountains, looking up to the precepts of
the law and to the gifts of grace, whence my help came from the Lord, who, not requiting me according
to mine iniquity, enlightened my blindness, loosed my bonds, humbled me who had been sinfully
exalted, in order that He might exalt me when graciously humbled.</P>

<P>3. Therefore I follow, with halting pace indeed as yet, the great examples of the just, if I may
through your prayers apprehend that for which I have been apprehended by the compassion of God.
Guide, therefore, this infant creeping on the ground, and by your steps teach him to walk. For I
would not have you judge of me by the age which began with my natural birth, but by that which began
with my spiritual new birth. For as to the natural life, my age is that which the cripple, healed by
the apostles by the power of their word at the gate Beautiful, had attained.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2949_1136510">67</A></SUP> But with respect to the birth of my soul, mine is
as yet the age of those infants who, being sacrificed by the death-blows which were aimed at Christ,
preceded with blood worthy of such honour the offering of the Lamb, and were the harbingers of the
passion of the Lord.<SUP><A HREF="#P2950_1136811">68</A></SUP> Therefore, as I am
but a babe in the word of God, and as to spiritual age a sucking child, satisfy my vehement desire by
nourishing me with your words, the breasts of faith, and wisdom, and love. If you consider only the
office which we both hold, you are my brother; but if you consider the ripeness of your understanding
and other powers, you are, though my junior in years, a father to me; because the possession of a
venerable wisdom has promoted you, though young, to a maturity of worth, and to the honour which
belongs to those who are old. Foster and strengthen me, then, for I am, as I have said, but a child
in the sacred Scriptures and in spiritual studies; and seeing that, after long contendings and
frequent shipwreck, I have but little skill, and am even now with difficulty rising above the waves
of this world, do you, who have already found firm footing on the shore, receive me into the safe
refuge of your bosom, that, if it please you, we may together sail towards the harbour of salvation.
Meanwhile, in my efforts to escape from the dangers of this life and the abyss of sin, support me by
your prayers, as by a plank, that from this world I may escape as one does from a shipwreck, leaving
all behind.</P>

<P>4. I have therefore been at pains to rid myself of all baggage and garments which might impede my
progress, in order that, obedient to the command and sustained by the help of Christ, I may swim,
unhindered by any clothing for the flesh or care for the morrow, across the sea of this present life,
which, swelling with waves and echoing with the barking of our sins, like the dogs of Scylla,
separates between us and God. I do not boast that I have accomplished this: even if I might so boast,
I would glory only in the Lord, whose it is to accomplish what it is our part to desire; but my soul
is in earnest that the judgments of the Lord be her chief desire. You can judge how far he is on the
way to efficiently performing the will of God, who is desirous that he may desire to perform it.
Nevertheless, so far as in me lies, I have loved the beauty of His sanctuary, and, if left to myself,
would have chosen to occupy the lowest place in the Lord's house. But to Him who was pleased to
separate me from my mother's womb, and to draw me away from the friendship of flesh and blood to His
grace, it has seemed good to raise me from the earth and from the gulf of misery, though destitute of
all merit, and to take me from the mire and from the dunghill, to set me among the princes of His
people, and appoint my place in the same rank with yourself; so that, although you excel me in worth,
I should be associated with you as your equal in office.</P>

<P>5. It is not therefore by my own presumption, but .in accordance with the pleasure and appointment
of the Lord, that I appropriate the honour of which I own myself unworthy, claiming for myself the
bond of brotherhood with you; for I am persuaded, from the holiness of your character, that you are
taught by the truth "not to mind high things, but to condescend to men of low estate." Therefore I
hope that you will readily and kindly accept the assurance of the love which in humility we bear to
you, and which, I trust, you have already received through the most blessed priest Alypius, whom
(with his permission) we call our father. For he doubtless has himself given you an example of loving
us both while we are yet strangers, and above our desert; for he has found it possible, in the spirit
of far-reaching and self-diffusing genuine love, to behold us by affection, and to come in contact
with us by writing, even when we were unknown to him, and severed by a wide interval both of land and
sea. He has presented us with the first proofs of his affection to us, and evidences of your love, in
the above-mentioned gift of books. And as he was greatly concerned that we should be constrained to
ardent love for you, when known to us, not by his testimony alone, but more fully by the eloquence
and the faith seen in your own writings; so do we believe that he has taken care, with equal zeal, to
bring you to imitate his example in cherishing a very warm love towards us in return. O brother in
Christ, beloved, venerable, and ardently longed for, we desire that the grace of God, as it is with
you, may abide for ever. We salute, with the utmost affection of cordial brotherhood, your whole
household, and every one who is in the Lord a companion and imitator of your holiness. We beg you to
bless, in accepting it, one loaf which we have sent to your Charity, in token of our oneness of heart
with you.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XXVI.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 395.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Licentius</I><SUP><A HREF="#P2957_1141452">69</A></SUP><I> from
Augustin.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I have with difficulty found an opportunity for writing to you: who would believe it? Yet
Licentius must take my word for it. I do not wish you to search curiously for the causes and reasons
of this; for though they could be given, your confidence in me acquits me of obligation to furnish
them. Moreover, I received your letters by messengers who were not available for the carrying back of
my reply. And as to the thing which you asked me to ask, I attended to it by letter as far as it
seemed to me right to bring it forward; but with what result you may have seen. If I have not yet
succeeded, I will press the matter more earnestly, either when the result comes to my knowledge, or
when you yourself remind me of it. Thus far I have spoken to you of the things in which we hear the
sound of the chains of this life. I pass from them. Receive now in a few words the utterance of my
heart's anxieties concerning your hope for eternity, and the question how a way may be opened for you
to God.</P>

<P>2. I fear, my dear Licentius, that you, while repeatedly rejecting and dreading the restraints of
wisdom, as if these were bonds, are becoming firmly and fatally in bondage to mortal things. For
wisdom, though at first it restrains men, and subdues them by some labours in the way of discipline,
gives them presently true freedom, and enriches them, when free, with the possession and enjoyment of
itself; and though at first it educates them by the help of temporary restraints, it folds them
afterwards in its eternal embrace, the sweetest and strongest of all conceivable bonds. I admit,
indeed, that these initial restraints are somewhat hard to bear; but the ultimate restraints of
wisdom I cannot call grievous, because they are most sweet; nor can I call them easy, because they
are most firm: in short, they possess a quality which cannot be described, but which can be the
object of faith, and hope, and love. The bonds of this world, on the other hand, have a real
harshness and a delusive charm, certain pain and uncertain pleasure, hard toil and troubled rest, an
experience full of misery, and a hope devoid of happiness. And are you submitting neck and hands and
feet to these chains, desiring to be burdened with honours of this kind, reckoning your labours to be
in vain if they are not thus rewarded, and spontaneously aspiring to become fixed in that to which
neither persuasion nor force ought to have induced you to go? Perhaps you answer, in the words of the
slave in Terence,</P>

    <UL><UL><P>"So ho, you are pouring out wise words here."</P>

</UL></UL><P>Receive my words, then, that I may pour them out without wasting them. But if I sing,
while you prefer to dance to another tune, even thus I do not regret my effort to give advice; for
the exercise of singing yields pleasure even when the song fails to stir to responsive .motion the
person for whom it is sung with loving care. There were in your letters some verbal mistakes which
attracted my attention, but I judge it trifling to discuss these when solicitude about your actions
and your whole life disturbs me.</P>

<P>3. If your verses were marred by defective arrangement, or violated the laws of prosody, or grated
on the ears of the hearer by imperfect rhythm, you would doubtless be ashamed, and you would lose no
time, you would take no rest, until you arranged, corrected, remodelled, and balanced your
composition, devoting any amount of earnest study and toil to the acquisition and practice of the art
of versification: but when you yourself are marred by disorderly living, when you violate the laws of
God, when your life accords neither with the honourable desires of friends on your behalf, nor with
the light given by your own learning, do you think this is a trifle to be cast out of sight and out
of mind? As if, forsooth, you thought yourself of less value than the sound of your own voice, and
esteemed it a smaller matter to displease God by ill-ordered life, than to provoke the censure of
grammarians by ill-ordered syllables.</P>

<P>4. You write thus: "Oh that the morning light of other days could with its gladdening chariot
bring back to me bright hours that are gone, which we spent together in the heart of Italy and among
the high mountains, when proving the generous leisure and pure privileges which belong to the good!
Neither stern winter with its frozen snow, nor the rude blasts of Zephyrs and raging of Boreas, could
deter me from following your footsteps with eager tread. You have only to express your wish."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2964_1146139">70</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Woe be to me if I do not express this wish, nay, if I do not compel and command, or beseech and
implore you to follow me. If, however, your ear is shut against my voice, let it be open to your own
voice, and give heed to your own poem: listen to yourself, O friend, most unyielding, unreasonable,
and unimpressible. What care I for your tongue of gold, while your heart is of iron? How shall I, not
in verses, but in lamentations, sufficiently bewail these verses of yours, in which I discover what a
soul, what a mind that is which I am not permitted to seize and present as an offering to our God?
You are waiting for me to express the wish that you should become good, and enjoy rest and happiness:
as if any day could shine more pleasantly on me than that in which I shall enjoy in God your gifted
mind, or as if you did not know how I hunger and thirst for you, or as if you did not in this poem
itself confess this. Return to the mind in which you wrote these things; say to me now again, "You
have only to express your wish." Here then is my wish, if my expression of it be enough to move you
to comply: Give yourself to me-give yourself to my Lord, who is the Lord of us both and who has
endowed you with your faculties: for what am I but through Him your servant, and under Him your
fellow-servant?</P>

<P>5. Nay, has not He given expression to His will? Hear the gospel: it declares, "Jesus stood and
cried."<SUP><A HREF="#P2967_1147621">71</A></SUP> "Come unto me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
and lowly in heart: so shall ye find rest to your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
light."<SUP><A HREF="#P2968_1147878">72</A></SUP> If these words are not heard, or
are heard only with the ear, do you, Licentius, expect Augustin to issue his command to his
fellow-servant, and not rather complain that the will of his Lord is despised, when He orders, nay
invites, and as it were entreats all who labour to seek rest in Him? But to your strong and proud
neck, forsooth, the yoke of the world seems easier than the yoke of Christ; yet consider, in regard
to the yoke which He imposes, by whom and with what recompense it is imposed. Go to Campania, learn
in the case of Paulinus, that eminent and holy servant of God, how great worldly honours he shook
off, without hesitation, from neck truly noble because humble, in order that he might place it, as he
has done, beneath the yoke of Christ; and now, with his mind at rest, he meekly rejoices in Him as
the guide of his way. Go, learn with what wealth of mind he offers to Him the sacrifice of praise,
rendering unto Him all the good which he has received from Him, test, by failing to store all that he
has in Him from whom he received it, he should lose it all.</P>

<P>6. Why are you so excited? why so wavering? why do you turn your ear away from us, and lend it to
the imaginations of fatal pleasures? They are false, they perish, and they lead to perdition. They
are false, Licentius. "May the truth," as you desire, "be made plain to us by demonstration, may it
flow more clear than Eridanus." The truth alone declares what is true: Christ is the truth; let us
come to Him that we may be released from labour. That He may heal us, let us take His yoke upon us,
and learn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart, and we shall find rest unto our souls: for His yoke
is easy, and His burden is light. The devil desires to wear you as an ornament. Now, if you found in
the earth a golden chalice, you would give it to the Church of God. But you have received from God
talents that are spiritually valuable as gold; and do you devote these to the service of your lusts,
and surrender yourself to Satan? Do it not, I entreat you. May you at some time perceive with what a
sad and sorrowful heart I have written these things; and I pray you, have pity on me if you have
ceased to be precious in your own eyes.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2971_1150116"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XXVII.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 395.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Lord, Holy and Venerable, and Worthy of Highest Praise in Christ, My Brother
Paulinus, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. O excellent man and excellent brother, there was a time when you were unknown to my mind;
and I charge my mind to bear patiently your being still unknown to my eyes, but it almost-nay,
altogether-refuses to obey. Does it indeed bear this patiently? If so, why then does a longing for
your presence rack my inmost soul? For if I were suffering bodily infirmities, and these did not
interrupt the serenity of my mind, I might be justly said to bear them patiently; but when I cannot
bear with equanimity the privation of not seeing you, it would be intolerable were I to call my state
of mind patience. Nevertheless, it would perhaps be still more intolerable if I were to be found
patient while absent from you, seeing that you are such an one as you are. It is well, therefore,
that I am unsatisfied under a privation which is such that, if I were satisfied under it, every one
would justly be dissatisfied with me. What has befallen me is strange, yet true: I grieve because I
do not see you, and my grief itself comforts me; for I neither admire nor covet a fortitude easily
consoled under the absence of good men such ins you are. For do we not long for the heavenly
Jerusalem? and the more impatiently we long for it, do we not the more patiently submit to all things
for its sake? Who can so withhold himself from joy in seeing you, as to feel no pain when you are. no
longer seen? I at least can do neither; and seeing that if I could, it could only be by trampling on
right and natural feeling, I rejoice that I cannot, and in this rejoicing I find some consolation. It
is therefore not the removal, but the contemplation, of this sorrow that consoles me. Blame me not, I
beseech you, with that devout seriousness of spirit which so eminently distinguishes you; say not
that I do wrong to grieve because of my not yet knowing you, when you have disclosed to my sight your
mind, which is the inner man. For if, when sojourning in any place, or in the city to which you
belong, I had come to know you as my brother and friend, and as one so eminent as a Christian, so
noble as a man, how could you think that it would be no disappointment to me if I were not permitted
to know your dwelling? How, then, can I but mourn because I have not yet seen your face and form, the
dwelling-place of that mind which I have come to know as if it were my own?</P>

<P>2. For I have read your letter, which flows with milk and honey, which exhibits the simplicity of
heart wherewith, under the guidance of piety, you seek the Lord, and which brings glory and honour to
Him. The brethren have read it also, and find unwearied and ineffable satisfaction in those abundant
and excellent gifts with which God has endowed you. As many as have read it carry it away with them,
because, while they read, it carries them away. Words cannot express how sweet is the savour of
Christ which your letter breathes. How strong is the wish to be more fully acquainted with you which
that letter awakens by presenting you to our sight! for it at once permits us to discern and prompts
us to desire you. For the more effectually that it makes us in a certain sense realize your presence,
the more does it render us impatient under your absence. All love you as seen therein, and wish to be
loved by you. Praise and thanksgiving are offered to God, by whose grace you are what you are. In
your letter, Christ is awakened that He may be pleased to calm the winds and the waves for you,
directing your steps towards His perfect stedfastness.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2976_1153777">73</A></SUP> In it the reader beholds a wife<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2977_1153860">74</A></SUP> who does not bring her husband to effeminacy, but
by union to him is brought herself to share the strength of his nature; and unto her in you, as
completely one with you, and bound to you by spiritual ties which owe their strength to their purity,
we desire to return our salutations with the respect due to your Holiness. In it, the cedars of
Lebanon, levelled to the ground, and fashioned by the skilful craft of love into the form of the Ark,
cleave the waves of this world, fearless of decay. In it, glory is scorned that it may be secured,
and the world given up that it may be gained. In it, the little ones, yea, the mightier sons of
Babylon, the sins of turbulence and pride, are dashed against the rock.</P>

<P>3. These and other such most delightful and hallowed spectacles are presented to the readers of
your letter,-that letter which exhibits a true faith, a good hope, a pure love. How it breathes to us
your thirst, your longing and fainting for the courts of the Lord! With what holy love it is
inspired! How it overflows with the abundant treasure of a true heart! What thanksgivings it renders
to God! What blessings it procures from Him! Is it elegance or fervour, light or life-giving power,
which shines most in your letter? For how can it at once soothe us and animate us? how can it combine
fertilizing rains with the brightness of a cloudless sky? How is this? I ask; or how shall I repay
you, except by giving myself to be wholly yours in Him whose you wholly are? If this be little, it is
at least all I have to give. But you have made me think it not little, by your deigning to honour me
in that letter with such praises, that when I requite you by giving myself to you, I would be
chargeable if I counted the gift a small one, with refusing to believe your testimony. I am ashamed,
indeed, to believe so much good spoken of myself, but I am yet more unwilling to refuse to believe
you. I have one way of escape from the dilemma: I shall not credit your estimate of my character,
because I do not recognise myself in the portrait you have drawn; but I shall believe myself to be
beloved by you, because I perceive and feel this beyond all doubt. Thus I shall be found neither rash
in judging of myself, nor ungrateful for your esteem. Moreover, when I offer myself to you, it is not
a small offering; for I offer one whom you very warmly love, and one who, though he is not what you
suppose him to be, is nevertheless one for whom you are praying that he may become such. And your
prayers I now beg the more earnestly, lest, thinking me to be already what I am not, you should be
less solicitous for the supply of that which I lack.</P>

<P>4. The bearer of this letter<SUP><A HREF="#P2980_1156557">75</A></SUP> to your
Excellency and most eminent Charity is one of my dearest friends, and most intimately known to me
from early years. His name is mentioned in the treatise <I>De Religione</I>, which your Holiness, as
you indicate in your letter, has read with very great pleasure, doubtless because it was made more
acceptable to you by the recommendation of so good a man as he who sent it to you.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2981_1156991">76</A></SUP> I would not wish you, however, to give credence
to the statements which, perchance, one who is so intimately my friend may have made in praise of me.
For I have often observed, that, without intending to say what was untrue, he was, by the bias of
friendship, mistaken in his opinion concerning me, and that he thought me to be already possessed of
many things, for the gift of which my heart earnestly waited on the Lord. And if he did such things
in my presence, who may not conjecture that out of the fulness of his heart he may utter many things
more excellent than true concerning me when absent? He will submit to your esteemed attention, and
review all my treatises; for I am not aware of having written anything, either addressed to those who
are beyond the pale of the Church, or to the brethren, which is not in his possession. But when you
are reading these, my holy Paulinus, let not those things which Truth has spoken by my weak
instrumentality, so carry you away as to prevent your carefully observing what I myself have spoken,
lest, while you drink in with eagerness the things good and true which have been given to me as a
servant, you should forget to pray for the pardon of my errors and mistakes. For in all that shall,
if observed, justly displease you, I myself am seen; but in all which in my books is justly approved
by you, through the gift of the Holy Spirit bestowed on you, He is to be loved, He is to be praised,
with whom is the fountain of life, and in whose light we shall see light,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2982_1158524">77</A></SUP> not darkly as we do here, but face to
face.<SUP><A HREF="#P2983_1158587">78</A></SUP> When, in reading over my writings, I
discover in them anything which is due to the working of the old leaven in me, I blame myself for it
with true sorrow; but if anything which I have spoken is, by God's gift, from the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth, I rejoice therein with trembling. For what have we that we have not received?
Yet it may be said, his portion is better whom God has endowed with larger and more numerous gifts,
than his on whom smaller and fewer have been conferred. True; but, on the other hand, it is better to
have a small gift, and to render to Him due thanks for it, than, having a large gift, to wish to
claim the merit of it as our own. Pray for me, my brother, that I may make such acknowledgments
sincerely, and that my heart may not be at variance with my tongue. Pray, I beseech you, that, not
coveting praise to myself, but rendering praise to the Lord, I may worship Him; and I shall be safe
from mine enemies.</P>

<P>5. There is yet another thing which may move you to love more warmly the brother who bears my
letter; for he is a kinsman of the venerable and truly blessed bishop Alypius, whom you love with
your whole heart, and justly: for whoever thinks highly of that man, thinks highly of the great mercy
and wonderful gifts which God has bestowed on him. Accordingly, when he had read your request,
desiring him to write for you a sketch of his history, and, while willing to do, it because of your
kindness, was yet unwilling to do it because of his humility, I, seeing him unable to decide between
the respective claims of love and humility, transferred the burden from his shoulders to my own, for
he enjoined me by letter to do so. I shall therefore, with God's help, soon place in your heart
Alypius just as he is: for this I chiefly feared, that he would be afraid to declare all that God has
conferred on him, lest (since what he writes would be read by others besides you) he should seem to
any who are less competent to discriminate to be commending not God's goodness bestowed on men, but
his own merits; and that thus you, who know what construction to put on such statements, would,
through his regard for the infirmity of others, be deprived of that which to you as a brother ought
to be imparted. This I would have done already, and you would already be reading my description of
him, had not my brother suddenly resolved to set out earlier than we expected. For him I bespeak a
welcome from your heart and from your lips as kindly as if your acquaintance with him was not
beginning now, but of as long standing as my own. For if he does not shrink from laying himself open
to your heart, he will be in great measure, if not completely, healed by your lips; for I desire him
to be often made to hear the words of those who cherish for their friends a higher love than that
which is of this world.</P>

<P>6. Even if Romanianus had not been going to visit your Charity, I had resolved to recommend to you
by letter his son [Licentius], dear to me as my own (whose name you will find also in some of my
books), in order that he may be encouraged, exhorted, and instructed, not so much by the sound of
your voice, as by the example of your spiritual strength. I desire earnestly, that while his life is
yet in the green blade, the tares may be turned into wheat, and he may believe those who know by
experience the dangers to which he is eager to expose himself. From the poem of my young friend, and
my letter to him, your most benevolent and considerate wisdom may perceive my grief, fear, and care
on his account. I am not without hope that, by the Lord's favour, I may through your means be set
free from such disquietude regarding him.</P>

<P>As you are now about to read much that I have written, your love will be much more gratefully
esteemed by me, if, moved by compassion, and judging impartially, you correct and reprove whatever
displeases you. For you are not one whose oil anointing my head would make me afraid.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn29.htm#P2987_1162571">79</A></SUP> </P>

<P>The brethren, not those only who dwell with us, and those who, dwelling elsewhere, serve God in
the same way as we do, but almost all who are in Christ our warm friends, send you salutations, along
with the expression of their veneration and affectionate longing for you as a brother, as a saint,
and as a man.<SUP><A HREF="#P2989_1163018">80</A></SUP> I dare not ask; but if you
have any leisure from ecclesiastical duties, you may see for what favour all Africa, with myself, is
thirsting. </P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. Never was the face of any one more familiar to another, than the peaceful, happy, and truly
noble diligence of your studies in the Lord has become to me. For although I long greatly to be
acquainted with you, I feel that already my knowledge of you is deficient in respect of nothing but a
very small part of you,-namely, your personal appearance; and even as to this, I cannot deny that
since my most blessed brother Alypius (now invested with the office of bishop, of which he was then
truly worthy) has seen you, and has on his return been seen by me, it has been almost completely
imprinted on my mind by his report of you; nay, I may say that before his return, when he saw you
there, I was seeing you myself with his eyes. For any one who knows us may say of him and me, that in
body only, and not in mind, we are two, so great is the union of heart, so firm the intimate
friendship subsisting between us; though in merit we are not alike, for his is far above mine.
Seeing, therefore, that you love me, both of old through the communion of spirit by which we are knit
to each other, and more recently through what you know of me from the mouth of my friend, I feel that
it is not presumptuous in me (as it would be in one wholly unknown to you) to recommend to your
brotherly esteem the brother Profuturus, in whom we trust that the happy omen of his name
(Good-speed) may be fulfilled through our efforts furthered after this by your aid; although,
perhaps, it may be presumptuous on this ground, that he is so great a man, that it would be much more
fitting that I should be commended to you by him, than he by me. I ought perhaps to write no more, if
I were willing to content myself with the style of a formal letter of introduction; but my mind
overflows into conference with you, concerning the studies with which we are occupied in Christ Jesus
our Lord, who is pleased to furnish us largely through your love with many benefits, and some helps
by the way, in the path which He has pointed out to His followers.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>2. We therefore, and with us all that are devoted to study in the African churches, beseech you
not to refuse to devote care and labour to the translation of the books of those who have written in
the Greek language most able commentaries on our Scriptures. You may thus put us also in possession
of these men, and especially of that one whose name you seem to have singular pleasure in sounding
forth in your writings [Origen]. But I beseech you not to devote your labour to the work of
translating into Latin the sacred canonical books, unless you follow the method in which you have
translated Job, viz. with the addition of notes, to let it be seen plainly what differences there are
between this version of yours and that of the LXX., whose authority is worthy of highest esteem. For
my own part, I cannot sufficiently express my wonder that anything should at this date be found in
the Hebrew Mss. which escaped so many translators perfectly acquainted with the language. I say
nothing of the LXX., regarding whose harmony in mind and spirit, surpassing that which is found in
even one man, I dare not in any way pronounce a decided opinion, except that in my judgment, beyond
question, very high authority must in this work of translation be conceded to them. I am more
perplexed by those translators who, though enjoying the advantage of labouring after the LXX. had
completed their work, and although well acquainted, as it is reported, with the force of Hebrew words
and phrases, and with Hebrew syntax, have not only failed to agree among themselves, but have left
man), things which, even after so long a time, still remain to be discovered and brought to light.
Now these things were either obscure or plain: if they were obscure, it is believed that you are as
likely to have been mistaken as the others; if they were plain, it is not believed that they [the
LXX.] could possibly have been mistaken. Having stated the grounds of my perplexity, I appeal to your
kindness to give me an answer regarding this matter.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>3. I have been reading also some writings, ascribed to you, on the Epistles of the Apostle Paul.
In reading your exposition of the Epistle to the Galatians, that passage came to my hand in which the
Apostle Peter is called back from a course of dangerous dissimulation. To find there the defence of
falsehood undertaken, whether by you, a man of such weight, or by any author (if it is the writing of
another), causes me, I must confess, great sorrow, until at least those things which decide my
opinion in the matter are refuted, if indeed they admit of refutation. For it seems to me that most
disastrous consequences must follow upon our believing that anything false is found in the sacred
books: that is to say, that the men by whom the Scripture has been given to us, and committed to
writing, did put down in these books anything false. It is one question whether it may be at any time
the duty of a good man to deceive; but it is another question whether it can have been the duty of a
writer of Holy Scripture to deceive: nay, it is not another question-it is no question at all. For if
you once admit into such a high sanctuary of authority one false statement as made in the way of
duty,<SUP><A HREF="#P3001_1169570">82</A></SUP> there will not be left a single
sentence of those books which, if appearing to any one difficult in practice or hard to believe, may
not by the same fatal rule be explained away, as a statement in which, intentionally, and under a
sense of duty, the author declared what was not true.</P>

<P>4. For if the Apostle Paul did not speak the truth when, finding fault with the Apostle Peter, he
said: "If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why
compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"-if, indeed, Peter seemed to him to be doing
what was right, and if, notwithstanding, he, in order to soothe troublesome opponents, both said and
wrote that Peter did what was wrong;<SUP><A HREF="#P3003_1170311">83</A></SUP> -if
we say thus, what then shall be our answer when perverse men such as he himself prophetically
described arise, forbidding marriage,<SUP><A HREF="#P3004_1170469">84</A></SUP> if
they defend themselves by saying that, in all which the same apostle wrote in confirmation of the
lawfulness of marriage,<SUP><A HREF="#P3005_1170614">85</A></SUP> he was, on account
of men who, through love for their wives, might become troublesome opponents, declaring what was
false,-saying these things, forsooth, not because he believed them, but because their opposition
might thus be averted? It is unnecessary to quote many parallel examples. For even things which
pertain to the praises of God might be represented as piously intended falsehoods, written in order
that love for Him might be enkindled in men who were slow of heart; and thus nowhere in the sacred
books shall the authority of pure truth stand sure. Do we not observe the great care with which the
same apostle commends the truth to us, when he says: "And if Christ be not risen, then is our:
preaching vain, and your faith is also vain: yea, I and we are found false witnesses of God; because
we have testified of God that He raised upChrist; whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise
not."<SUP><A HREF="#P3006_1171547">86</A></SUP> If any one said to him, "Why are you
so shocked by this falsehood, when the thing which you have said, even if it were false, tends very
greatly to the glory of God?" would he not, abhorring the madness of such a man, with every word and
sign which could express his feelings, open clearly the secret depths of his own heart, protesting
that to speak well of a falsehood uttered on behalf of God, was a crime not less, perhaps even
greater, than to speak ill of the truth concerning Him? We must therefore be careful to secure, in
order to our knowledge of the divine Scriptures, the guidance only of such a man as is imbued with a
high reverence for the sacred books, and a profound persuasion of their truth, preventing him from
flattering himself in any part of them with the hypothesis of a statement being made not because it
was true, but because it was expedient, and making him rather pass by what he does not understand,
than set up his own feelings above that truth. For, truly, when he pronounces anything to be untrue,
he demands that he be believed in preference, and endeavours to shake our confidence in the authority
of the divine Scriptures.</P>

<P>5. For my part, I would devote all the strength which the Lord grants me, to show that every one
of those texts which are wont to be quoted in defence of the expediency of falsehood ought to be
otherwise understood, in order that everywhere the sure truth of these passages themselves may be
consistently maintained. For as statements adduced in evidence must not be false, neither ought they
to favour falsehood. This, however, I leave to your own judgment. For if you apply more thorough
attention to the passage, perhaps you will see it much more readily than I have done. To this more
careful study that piety will move you, by which you discern that the authority of the divine
Scriptures becomes unsettled (so that every one may believe what he wishes, and reject what he does
not wish) if this be once admitted, that the men by whom these things have been delivered unto us,
could in their writings state some things which were not true, from considerations of duty;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3008_1173704">87</A></SUP> unless, perchance, you propose to furnish us with
certain rules by which we may know when a falsehood might or might not become a duty. If this can be
done, I beg you to set forth these rules with reasonings which may be neither equivocal nor
precarious; and I beseech you by our Lord, in whom Truth was incarnate, not to consider me burdensome
or presumptuous in making this request. For a mistake of mine which is in the interest of truth
cannot deserve great blame, if indeed it deserves blame at all, when it is possible for you to use
truth in the interest of falsehood without doing wrong.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>6. Of many other things I would wish to discourse with your most ingenuous heart, and to take
counsel with you concerning Christian studies; but this desire could not be satisfied within the
limits of any letter. I may do this more fully by means of the brother bearing this letter, whom I
rejoice in sending to share and profit by your sweet and useful conversation. Nevertheless, although
I do not reckon myself superior in any respect to him, even he may take less from you than I would
desire; and he will excuse my saying so, for I confess myself to hay, more room for receiving from
you than he has. I see his mind to be already more fully stored, in which unquestionably he excels
me. Therefore, when he returns, as I trust he may happily do by God's blessing, and when I become a
sharer in all with which his heart has been richly furnished by you, there will still be a
consciousness of void unsatisfied in me, and a longing for personal fellowship with you. Hence of the
two I shall be the poorer, and he the richer, then as now. This brother carries with him some of my
writings, which if you condescend to read, I implore you to review them with candid and brotherly
strictness. For the words of Scripture, "The righteous shall correct me in compassion, and reprove
me; but the oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3011_1175676">88</A></SUP> I understand to mean that he is the truer friend
who by his censure heals me, than the one who by flattery anoints my head. I find the greatest
difficulty in exercising a right judgment when I read over what I have written, being either too
cautious or too rash. For I sometimes see my own faults, but I prefer to hear them reproved by those
who are better able to judge than I am; lest after I have, perhaps justly, charged myself with error,
I begin again to flatter myself, and think that my censure has arisen from an undue mistrust of my
own judgment.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XXIX.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 395.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>A Letter from the Presbyter of the District of Hippo to Alypius the Bishop of Thagaste,
Concerning the Anniversary of the Birth of Leontius,</I><SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3016_1176447">89</A></SUP><I> Formerly Bishop of Hippo.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. In the absence of brother Macharius, I have not been able to write anything definite
concerning a matter about which I could not feel otherwise than anxious: it is said, however, that he
will soon return, and whatever can be with God's help done in the matter shall be done. Although also
our brethren, citizens of your town, who were with us, might sufficiently assure you of our
solicitude on their behalf when they returned, nevertheless the thing which the Lord has granted to
me is one worthy to be the subject of that epistolary intercourse which ministers so much to the
comfort of us both; it is, moreover, a thing in the obtaining of which I believe that I have been
greatly assisted by your own solicitude regarding it, seeing that it could not but constrain you to
intercession on our behalf.</P>

<P>2. Therefore let me not fail to relate to your Charity what has taken place; so that, as you
joined us in pouring out prayers for this mercy before it was obtained, you may now join us in
rendering thanks for it after it has been received. When I was informed after your departure that
some were becoming openly violent, and declaring that they could not submit to the prohibition
(intimated while you were here) of that feast which they call Laetitia, vainly attempting to disguise
their revels under a fair name, it happened most opportunely for me, by the hidden fore-ordination of
the Almighty God, that on the fourth holy day that chapter of the Gospel fell to be expounded in
ordinary course, in which the words occur: "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast
ye your pearls before swine."<SUP><A HREF="#P3019_1178274">90</A></SUP> I discoursed
therefore concerning dogs and swine in such a way as to compel those who clamour with obstinate
barking against the divine precepts, and who are given up to the abominations of carnal pleasures, to
blush for shame; and followed it up by saying, that they might plainly see how criminal it was to do,
under the name of religion, within the walls of the church, that which, if it were practised by them
in their own houses, would make it necessary for them to be debarred from that which is holy, and
from the privileges which are the pearls of the Church.</P>

<P>3. Although these words were well received, nevertheless, as few had attended the meeting, all had
not been done which so great an emergency required. When, however, this discourse was, according to
the ability and zeal of each, made known abroad by those who had heard it, it found many opponents.
But when the morning of Quadragesima came round, and a great multitude had assembled at the hour of
exposition of Scripture, that passage in the Gospel was read in which our Lord said, concerning those
sellers who were driven out of the temple, and the tables of the money-changers which He had
overthrown, that the house of His Father had been made a den of thieves instead of a house of
prayer.<SUP><A HREF="#P3021_1179556">91</A></SUP> After awakening their attention by
bringing forward the subject of immoderate indulgence in wine, I myself also read this chapter, land
added to it an argument to prove with how much greater anger and vehemence our Lord would cast forth
drunken revels, which are everywhere disgraceful, from that temple from which He thus drove out
merchandise lawful elsewhere, especially when the things sold were those required for the sacrifices
appointed in that dispensation; and I asked them whether they regarded a place occupied by men
selling what was necessary, or one used by men drinking to excess, as bearing the greater resemblance
to a den of thieves.</P>

<P>4. Moreover, as passages of Scripture which I had prepared were held ready to be put into my
hands, I went on to say that the Jewish nation, with all its lack of spirituality in religion, never
held feasts, even temperate feasts, much less feasts disgraced by intemperance, in their temple, in
which at that time the body and blood of the Lord were not yet offered, and that in history they are
not found to have been excited by wine on any public occasion bearing the name of worship, except
when they held a feast before the idol which they had made.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3023_1180781">92</A></SUP> While I said these things I took the manuscript
from the attendant, and read that whole passage. Reminding them of the words of the apostle, who
says, in order to distinguish Christians from the obdurate Jews, that they are his epistle written,
not on tables of stone, but on the fleshly tables of the heart,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3024_1181109">93</A></SUP> I asked further, with the deepest sorrow, how it
was that, although Moses the servant of God broke both the tables of stone because of these rulers of
Israel, I could not break the hearts of those who, though men of the New Testament dispensation, were
desiring in their celebration of saints' days to repeat often the public perpetration of excesses,of
which the people of the Old Testament economy were guilty only once, and that in an act of
idolatry.</P>

<P>5. Having then given back the manuscript of Exodus, I proceeded to enlarge, so far as my time
permitted, on the crime of drunkenness, and took up the writings of the Apostle Paul, and showed
among what sins it is classed by him, reading the text, "If any man that is called a brother be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an
one (ye ought) not even to eat;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3026_1182005">94</A></SUP>
pathetically reminding them how great is our danger in eating with those who are guilty of
intemperance even in their own houses. I read also what is added, a little further on, in the same
epistle: "Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor
abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye
are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
God."<SUP><A HREF="#P3027_1182609">95</A></SUP> After reading these, I charged them
to consider how believers could hear these words, "but ye are washed," if they still tolerated in
their own hearts-that is, in God's inner temple-the abominations of such lusts as these against which
the kingdom of heaven is shut. Then I went on to that passage: "When ye come together into one place,
this is not to eat the Lord's supper: for in eating, every one taketh before other his own supper;
and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in, or
despise ye the church of God?"<SUP><A HREF="#P3028_1183195">96</A></SUP> After
reading which, I more especially begged them to remark that not even innocent and temperate feasts
were permitted in the church: for the apostle said not, "Have ye not houses of your own in which to
be drunken? "-as if it was drunkenness alone which was unlawful in the church; but, "Have ye not
houses to eat and to drink in?"-things lawful in themselves, but not lawful in the church, inasmuch
as men have their own houses in which they may be recruited by necessary food: whereas now, by the
corruption of the times and the relaxation of morals, we have been brought so low, that, no longer
insisting upon sobriety in the houses of men, all that we venture to demand is, that the realm of
tolerated excess be restricted to their own homes.</P>

<P>6. I reminded them also of a passage in the Gospel which I had expounded the day before, inwhich
it is said of the false prophets: "Ye shall know them by their fruits."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3030_1184136">97</A></SUP> I also bade them remember that in that place our
works are signified by the word fruits. Then I asked among what kind of fruits drunkenness was named,
and read that passage in the Epistle to the Galatians: "Now the works of the flesh are manifest,
which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murder, drunkenness, revellings,
and such like; of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in time past, that they which do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3031_1184755">98</A></SUP> After these words, I asked how, when God has
commanded that Christians be known by their fruits, we could be known as Christians by this fruit of
drunkenness? I added also, that we must read what follows there: "But the fruit of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3032_1185105">99</A></SUP> And I pled with them to consider how shameful and
lamentable it would be, if, not content with living at home in the practice of these works of the
flesh, they even wished by them, forsooth, to honour the church, and to fill the whole area of so
large a place of worship, if they were permitted, with crowds of revellers and drunkards: and yet
would not present to God those fruits of the Spirit which, by the authority of Scripture, and by my
groans, they were called to yield, and by the offering of which they would most suitably celebrate
the saints' days.</P>

<P>7. This being finished, I returned the manuscript; and being asked to speak,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3034_1185765">100</A></SUP> I set before I their eyes with all my might, as
the danger itself constrained me, and as the Lord was pleased to give strength, the danger shared by
them who were committed to my care, and by me, who must give account to the Chief Shepherd, and
implored them by His humiliation, by the unparalleled insults, the buffetings and spitting on the
face which He endured, by His pierced hands and crown of thorns, and by His cross and blood, to have
pity on me at least, if they were displeased with themselves, and to consider the inexpressible love
cherished towards me by the aged and venerable Valerius, who had not scrupled to assign to me for
their sakes the perilous burden of expounding to them the word of truth, and had often told them that
in my coming here his prayers were answered; not rejoicing, surely, that I had come to share or to
behold the death of our hearers, but rejoicing that I had come to share his labours for the eternal
life. In conclusion, I told them that I was resolved to trust in Him who cannot lie, and who has
given us a promise by the mouth of the prophet, saying of our Lord Jesus Christ, "If His children
forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my
commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes:
nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from Him."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3035_1187186">101</A></SUP> I declared, therefore, that I put my trust in
Him, that if they despised the weighty words which had now been read and spoken to them, He would
visitthem with the rod and with stripes, and not leave them to be condemned with the world. In this
appeal I put forth all the power in thought and utterance which, in an emergency so great and
hazardous, our Saviour and Ruler was pleased to supply. I did not move them to weep by first weeping
myself; but while these things were being spoken, I own that, moved by the tears which they began to
shed, I myself could not refrain from following their example. And when we had thus wept together, I
concluded my sermon with full persuasion that they would be restrained by it from the abuses
denounced.</P>

<P>8. Next morning, however, when the day dawned, which so many were accustomed to devote to excess
in eating and drinking, I received notice that some, even of those who were present when I preached,
had not yet desisted from complaint, and that so great was the power of detestable custom with them,
that, using no other argument, they asked, "Wherefore is this now prohibited? Were they not
Christians who in former times did not interfere with this practice?" On hearing this, I knew not
what more powerful means for influencing them I could devise; but resolved, in the event of their
judging it proper to persevere, that after reading in Ezekiel's prophecy that the watchman has
delivered his own soul if he has given warning, even though the persons warned refuse to give heed to
him, I would shake my garments and depart. But then the Lord showed me that He leaves us not alone,
and taught me how He encourages us to trust Him; for before the time at which I had to ascend the
pulpit,<SUP><A HREF="#P3037_1188947">102</A></SUP> the very persons of whose
complaint against interference with long-established custom I had heard came to me. Receiving them
kindly, I by a few words brought them round to a right opinion; and when it came to the time for my
discourse, having laid aside the lecture which I had prepared as now unnecessary, I said a few things
concerning the question mentioned above, "Wherefore <I>now</I> prohibit this custom?" saying that to
those who might propose it the briefest and best answer would be this: "Let us now at last put down
what ought to have been earlier prohibited."</P>

<P>9. Lest, however, any slight should seem to be put by us on those who, before our time, either
tolerated or did not dare to put down such manifest excesses of an undisciplined multitude, I
explained to them the circumstances out of which this custom seems to have necessarily risen in the
Church,-namely, that when, in the peace which came after such numerous and violent persecutions,
crowds of heathen who wished to assume the Christian religion were kept back, because, having been
accustomed to celebrate the feasts connected with their worship of idols in revelling and
drunkenness, they could not easily refrain from pleasures so hurtful and so habitual, it had seemed
good to our ancestors, making for the time a concession to this infirmity, to permit them to
celebrate, instead of the festivals which they renounced, other feasts in honour of the holy martyrs,
which were observed, not as before with a profane design, but with similar self-indulgence. I added
that now upon them, as persons bound together in the name of Christ, and submissive to the yoke of
His august authority, the wholesome restraints of sobriety were laid-restraints with which the honour
and fear due to Him who appointed them should move them to comply -and that therefore the time had
now come in which all who did not dare to cast off the Christian profession should begin to walk
according to Christ's will; and being now confirmed Christians, should reject those concessions to
infirmity which were made only for a time in order to their becoming such.</P>

<P>10. I then exhorted them to imitate the example of the churches beyond the sea, in some of which
these practices had never been tolerated, while in others they had been already put down by the
people complying with the counsel of good ecclesiastical rulers; and as the examples of daily excess
in the use of wine in the church of the blessed Apostle Peter were brought forward in defence of the
practice, I said in the first place, that I had heard that these excesses had been often forbidden,
but because the place was at a distance from the bishop's control, and because in such a city the
multitude of carnally-minded persons was great, the foreigners especially, of whom there is a
constant influx, clinging to that practice with an obstinacy proportioned to their ignorance, the
suppression of so great an evil had not yet been possible. If, however, I continued, we would honour
the Apostle Peter, we ought to hear his words, and look much more to the epistles by which his mind
is made known to us, than to the place of worship, by which it is not made known; and immediately
taking the manuscript, I read his own words: "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the
flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased
from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, butto
the will of God. For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the
Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and
abominable idolatries."<SUP><A HREF="#P3040_1192667">103</A></SUP> After this, when
I saw that all were with one consent turning to a right mind, and renouncing the custom against which
I had protested, I exhorted them to assemble at noon for the reading of God's word and singing of
psalms; stating that we had resolved thus to celebrate the festival in a way much more accordant with
purity and piety; and that, by the number of worshippers who should assemble for this purpose, it
would plainly appear who were guided by reason, and who were the slaves of appetite. With these words
the discourse concluded.</P>

<P>11. In the afternoon a greater number assembled than in the forenoon, and there was reading and
praise alternately up to the hour at which I went out in company with the bishop; and after our
coming two psalms were read. Then the old man [Valerius] constrained me by his express command to say
something to the people; from which I would rather have been excused, as I was longing for the close
of the anxieties of the day. I delivered a short discourse in order to express our gratitude to God.
And as we heard the noise of the feasting, which was going on as usual in the church of the heretics,
who still prolonged their revelry while we were so differently engaged, I remarked that the beauty of
day is enhanced by contrast with the night, and that when anything black is near, the purity of white
is the more pleasing; and that, in like manner, our meeting for a spiritual feast might perhaps have
been somewhat less sweet to us, but for the contrast of the carnal excesses in which the others
indulged; and I exhorted them to desire eagerly such feasts as we then enjoyed, if they had tasted
the goodness of the Lord. At the same time, I said that those may well be afraid who seek anything
which shall one day be destroyed as the chief object of their desire, seeing that every one shares
the portion of that which he worships; a warning expressly given by the apostle to such, when he says
of them their "god is their belly,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3042_1194668">104</A></SUP>
inasmuch as he has elsewhere said, "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall
destroy both it and them."<SUP><A HREF="#P3043_1194815">105</A></SUP> I added that
it is our duty to seek that which is imperishable, which, far removed from carnal affections, is
obtained through sanctification of the spirit; and when those things which the Lord was pleased to
suggest to me had been spoken on this subject as the occasion required, the daily evening exercises
of worship were performed; and when with the bishop I retired from the church, the brethren said a
hymn there, a considerable multitude remaining in the church, and engaging in praise<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3044_1195330">106</A></SUP> even till daylight failed.</P>

<P>12. I have thus related as concisely as I could that which I am sure you longed to hear. Pray that
God may be pleased to protect our efforts from giving offence or provoking odium in any way. In the
tranquil prosperity which you enjoy we do with lively warmth of affection participate in no small
measure, when tidings so frequently reach us of the gifts possessed by the highly spiritual church of
Thagaste. The ship bringing our brethren has not yet arrived. At Hasna, where our brother Argentius
is presbyter, the Circumcelliones, entering our church, demolished the altar. The case is now in
process of trial; and we earnestly ask your prayers that it may be decided in a peaceful way and as
becomes the Catholic Church, so as to silence the tongues of turbulent heretics. I have sent a letter
to the Asiarch.<SUP><A HREF="#P3046_1196190">107</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Brethren most blessed, may ye persevere in the Lord, and remember us. Amen.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P3049_1196482"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XXX.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 396.)</P>

<P>This letter of Paulinus was written before receiving a reply to his former letter, No. 27, p.
248.</P>

<P><I>To Augustin, Our Lord and Holy and Beloved Brother, Paulinus and Therasia, Sinners, Send
Greeting.</I></P>

<P>1. My beloved brother in Christ the Lord, having through your holy and pious works come to know
you without your knowledge, and to see you though absent long ago, my mind embraced you with
unreserved affection, and I hastened to secure the gratification of hearing you through familiar
brotherly exchange of letters. I believe also that by the Lord's hand and favour my letter has
reached you; but as the youth whom, before winter, we had sent to salute you and others equally loved
in God's name, has not returned, we could no longer either put off what we feel to be our duty, or
restrain the vehemence of our desire to hear from you. If, then, my former letter has been found
worthy to reach you, this is the second; if, however, it was not so fortunate as to come to your
hand, accept this as the first.</P>

<P>2. But, my brother, judging all things as a spiritual man, do not estimate our love to you by the
duty which we render, or the frequency of our letters. For the Lord, who everywhere, as one and the
same, worketh His love in His own, is witness that, from the time when, by the kindness of the
venerable bishops Aurelius and Alypius, we came to know you through your writings against the
Manichaeans, love for you has taken such a place in us, that we seemed not so much to be acquiring a
new friendship as reviving an old affection. Now at length we address you in writing; and though we
are novices in expressing, we are not novices in feeling love to you; and by communion of the spirit,
which is the inner man, we are as it were acquainted with you. Nor is it strange that though distant
we are near, though unknown we are well known to each other; for we are members of one body, having
one Head, enjoying the effusion of the same grace, living by the same bread, walking in the same way,
and dwelling in the same home. In short, in all that makes up our being,-in the whole faith and hope
by which we stand in the present life, or labour for that which is to come,-we are both in the spirit
and in the body of Christ so united, that if we fell from this union we would cease to be.</P>

<P>3. How small a thing, therefore, is that which our bodily separation denies to us!-for it is
nothing more than one of those fruits that gratify the eyes, which are occupied only with the things
I of time. And yet, perhaps, we should not number this pleasure which in the body we enjoy among the
blessings which are only in timethe portion of spiritual men, to whose bodies the resurrection will
impart immortality; as we, though in ourselves unworthy, are bold to expect, through the merit of
Christ and the mercy of God the Father. Wherefore I pray that the grace of God by our Lord Jesus
Christ may grant unto us this favour too, that we may yet see your face. Not only would this bring
great gratification to our desires; but by it illumination would be brought to our minds, and our
poverty would be enriched by your abundance. This indeed you may grant to us even while we are absent
from you, especially on the present occasion, through our sons Romanus and Agilis, beloved and most
dear to us in the Lord (whom as our second selves we commend to you), when they return to us in the
Lord's name, after fulfilling the labour of love in which they are engaged; in which work we beg that
they may especially enjoy the goodwill of your Charity. For you know what high rewards the Most High
promises to the brother who gives his brother help. If you are pleased to impart to me any gift of
the grace that has been bestowed on you, you may safely do it through them; for, believe me, they are
of one heart and of one mind with us in the Lord. May the grace of God always abide as it is with
you, O brother beloved, venerable, most dear, and longed for in Christ the Lord! Salute on our behalf
all the saints in Christ who are with you, for doubtless such attach themselves to your fellowship;
commend us to them all, that they may, along with yourself, remember us in prayer. </P>

  <UL><P><I>To Brother Paulinus and to Sister Therasia, Most Beloved and Sincere, Truly Most Blessed
and Most Eminent for the Very Abundant Grace of God Bestowed on Them Augustin Sends Greeting in the
Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Although in my longing to be without delay near you in one sense, while still remote in
another, I wished much that what I wrote in answer to your former letter (if, indeed, any letter of
mine deserves to be called an answer to yours) should go with all possible expedition to your
Grace,<SUP><A HREF="#P3063_1201403">108</A></SUP> my delay has brought me the
advantage of a second letter from you. The Lord is Good, who often withholds what we desire, that He
may add to it what we would prefer. For it is one pleasure to me that you will write me on receiving
my letter, and it is another that, through not receiving it at once, you have written now. The joy
which I have felt in reading this letter would have been lost to me if my letter to your Holiness had
been quickly conveyed to you, as I intended and earnestly desired. But now, to have this letter, and
to expect a reply to my own, multiplies my satisfaction. The blame of the delay cannot be laid to my
charge; and the Lord, in His more abundant kindness, has done that which He judged to be more
conducive to my happiness.</P>

<P>2. We welcomed with great gladness in the Lord the holy brothers Romanus and Agilis, who were, so
to speak, an additional letter from you, capable of hearing and answering our voices, whereby most
agreeably your presence was in part enjoyed by us, although only to make us long the more eagerly to
see you. It would be at all times and in every way impossible for you to give, and unreasonable for
us to ask, as much information from you concerning yourself by letter as we received from them by
word of mouth. There was manifest also in them (what no paper could convey) such delight in telling
us of you, that by their very countenance and eyes while they spoke, we could with unspeakable joy
read you written on their hearts. Moreover, a sheet of paper, of whatever kind it be, and however
excellent the things written upon it may be, enjoys no benefit itself from what it contains, though
it may be unfolded with great benefit to others; but, in reading this letter of yours-namely, the
minds of these brethren-when conversing with them, we found that the blessedness of those upon whom
you had written was manifestly proportioned to the fulness with which they had been written upon by
you. In order, therefore, to attain to the same blessedness, we transcribed in our own hearts what
was written in theirs, by most eager questioning as to everything concerning you.</P>

<P>3. Notwithstanding all this, it is with deep regret that we consent to their so soon leaving us,
even to return to you. For observe, I beseech you, the conflicting emotions by which we are agitated.
Our obligation to let them go without delay was increased according to the vehemence of their desire
to obey you; but the greater the vehemence of this desire in them, the more completely did they set
you forth as almost present with us, because they let us see how tender your affections are.
Therefore our reluctance to let them go increased with our sense of the reasonableness of their
urgency to be permitted to go. Oh insupportable trial, were it not that by such partings we are not,
after all, separated from each other,-were it not that we are "members of one body, having one Head,
enjoying the effusion of the same grace, living by the same bread, walking in the same way, and
dwelling in the same home!"<SUP><A HREF="#P3066_1204460">109</A></SUP> You recognise
these words, I suppose, as quoted from your own letter; and why should not I also use them? Why
should they be yours any more than mine, seeing that, inasmuch as they are true, they proceed from
communion with the same head? And in so far as they contain something that has been specially given
to you, I have so loved them the more on that account, that they have taken possession of the way
leading through my breast, and would suffer no words to pass from my heart to my tongue until they
went first, with the priority which is due to them as yours. My brother and sister, holy and beloved
in God, members of the same body with us, who could doubt that we are animated by one spirit, except
those who are strangers to that affection by which we are bound to each other?</P>

<P>4. Yet I am curious to know whether you bear with more patience and ease than I do this bodily
separation. If it be so, I do not, I confess, take any pleasure in your fortitude in this respect,
unless perhaps because of its reasonableness, seeing that I confess myself much less worthy of your
affectionate longing than you are of mine. At all events, if I found in myself a power of bearing
your absence patiently, this would displease me, because it would make me relax my efforts to see
you; and what could be more absurd than to be made indolent by power of endurance? But I beg to
acquaint your Charity with the ecclesiastical duties by which I am kept at home, inasmuch as the
blessed father Valerius (who with me salutes you, and thirsts for you with a vehemence of which you
will hear from our brethren), not content with having me as his presbyter, has insisted upon adding
the greater burden of sharing the episcopate with him. This office I was afraid to decline, being
persuaded, through the love of Valerius and the importunity of the people, that it was the Lord's
will, and being precluded from excusing myself on other grounds by some precedents of similar
appointments. The yoke of Christ, it is true, is in itself easy, and His burden light;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3068_1206534">110</A></SUP> yet, through my perversity and infirmity, I may
find the yoke vexatious and the burden heavy in some degree; and I cannot tell how much more easy and
light my yoke and burden would become if I were comforted by a visit from you, who live, as I am
informed, more disengaged and free from such cares.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3069_1206855">111</A></SUP> I therefore feelwarranted in asking, nay,
demanding and imploring you to condescend to come over into Africa, which is more oppressed with
thirst for men such as you are than even by the well-known aridity of her soil.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3070_1207197">112</A></SUP> </P>

<P>5. God knoweth that I long for your visiting this country, not merely to gratify my own desire,
nor merely on account of those who through me, or by public report, have heard of your pious
resolution;<SUP><A HREF="#P3072_1207429">113</A></SUP> I long for it for the sake of
others also who either have not heard, or, hearing, have not believed the fame of your piety, but who
might be constrained to love excellence of which they could then be no longer in ignorance or doubt.
For although the perseverance and purity of your compassionate benevolence is good, more is required
of you; namely, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may behold your good works, and may
glorify your Father which is in heaven."<SUP><A HREF="#P3073_1208081">114</A></SUP>
The fishermen of Galilee found pleasure not only in leaving their ships and their nets at the Lord's
command, but also in declaring that they had left all and followed Him.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3074_1208275">115</A></SUP> And truly he despises all who despises not only
all that he was able, but also all that he was desirous to possess. What may have been desired is
seen only by the eyes of God; what was actually possessed is seen also by the eyes of men. Moreover,
when things trivial and earthly are loved by us, we are somehow more firmly wedded to what we have
than to what we desire to have. For whence was it that he who sought from the Lord counsel as to the
way of eternal life, went away sorrowful upon hearing that, if he would be perfect, he must sell all,
and distribute to the poor, and have treasure in heaven, unless because, as the Gospel tells us, he
had great possessions?<SUP><A HREF="#P3075_1208970">116</A></SUP> For it is one
thing to forbear from appropriating what is wanting to us; it is another thing to rend away that
which has become a part of ourselves: the former action is like declining food, the latter is like
cutting off a limb. How great and how full of wonder is the joy with which Christian charity beholds
in our day a sacrifice cheerfully made in obedience to the Gospel of Christ, which that rich man
grieved and refused to make at the bidding of Christ Himself!</P>

<P>6. Although language fails to express that which my heart has conceived and labours to utter,
nevertheless, since you perceive with your discernment and piety that the glory of this is not yours,
that is to say, not of man, but the glory of the Lord in you (for you yourselves are most carefully
on your guard against your Adversary, and most devoutly strive to be found as learners of Christ,
meek and lowly in heart; and, indeed, it were better with humility to retain than with pride to
renounce this world's wealth);-since, I say, you are aware that the glory here is not yours, but the
Lord's, you see how weak and inadequate are the things which I have spoken. For I have been speaking
of the praises of Christ, a theme transcending the tongue of angels. We long to see this glory of
Christ brought near to the eyes of our people; that in you, united in the bonds of wedlock, there may
be given to both sexes an example of the way in which pride must be trodden under foot, and
perfection hopefully pursued. I know not any way in which you could give greater proof of your
benevolence, than in resolving to be not less willing to permit your worth to be seen, than you are
zealous to acquire and retain it.</P>

<P>7. I recommend to your kindness and charity this boy Vetustinus, whose case might draw forth the
sympathy even of those who are not religious: the causes of his affliction and of his leaving his
country you will hear from his own lips. As to his pious resolution-his promise, namely, to devote
himself to the service of God-it will be more decisively known after some time has elapsed, when his
strength has been confirmed, and his present fear is removed. Perceiving the warmth of your love for
me, and encouraged thereby to believe that you will not grudge the labour of reading what I have
written, I send to your Holiness and Charity three books: would that the size of the volumes were an
index of the completeness of the discussion of so great a subject; for the question of free-will is
handled in them! I know that these books, or at least some of them, are not in the possession of our
brother Romanianus; but almost everything which I have been able for the benefit of any readers to
write is, as I have intimated, accessible to your perusal through him, because of your love to me,
although I did not charge him to carry them to you. For he already had them all, and was carrying
them with him: moreover, it was by him that my answer to your first letter was sent. I suppose that
your Holiness has already discovered, by that spiritual sagacity which the Lord has given you, how
much that man bears in his soul of what is good, and how far he still comes short through infirmity.
In the letter sent through him you have, as I trust, read with what anxiety I commended himself and
his son to your sympathy and love, as well as how close is the bond by which they are united to me.
May the Lord build them up by. your means! This must be asked from Him rather than from you, for I
know how much it is already your desire.</P>

<P>8. I have heard from the brethren that you are writing a treatise against the Pagans: if we have
any claim on your heart, send it at once to us to read. For your heart is such an oracle of divine
truth, that we expect from it answers which shall satisfactorily and clearly decide the most prolix
debates. I understand that your Holiness has the books of the most blessed father<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3079_1212887">117</A></SUP> Ambrose, of which I long greatly to see those
which, with much care and at great length, he has written against some most ignorant and pretentious
men, who affirm that our Lord was instructed by the writings of Plato.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3080_1213131">118</A></SUP> </P>

<P>9. Our most blessed brother Severus, formerly of our community, now president<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3082_1213250">119</A></SUP> of the church in Milevis, and well known by the
brethren in that city, joins me in respectful salutation to your Holiness. The brethren also who are
with me serving the Lord salute you as warmly as they long to see you: they long for you as much as
they love you; and they love you as your eminent goodness merits. The loaf which we send you will
become more rich as a blessing through the love with which your kindness receives it. May the Lord
keep you for ever from this generation,<SUP><A HREF="#P3083_1213754">120</A></SUP>

</UL><P>(a.d. 396.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Proculeianus, My Lord, Honourable and Most Beloved, Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. The titles prefixed to this letter I need not defend or explain at any length to you,
though they may give offence to the vain prejudices of ignorant men. For I rightly address you as
<I>lord</I>, seeing that we are both seeking to deliver each other from error, although to some it
may seem uncertain which of us is in error before the matter has been fully debated; and therefore we
are mutually <I>serving</I> one another, if we sincerely labour that we may both be delivered from
the perversity of discord. That I labour to do this with a sincere heart, and with the fear and
trembling of Christian humility, is not perhaps to most men manifest, but is seen by Him to whom all
hearts are open. What I without hesitation esteem <I>honourable</I> in you, you readily perceive. For
I do not esteem worthy of any honour the error of schism, from which I desire to have all men
delivered, so far as is within my power; but yourself I do not for a moment hesitate to regard as
worthy of honour, chiefly because you are knit to me in the bonds of a common humanity, and because
there are conspicuous in you some indications of a more gentle disposition, by which I am encouraged
to hope that you may readily embrace the truth when it has been demonstrated to you. As for my
<I>love</I> to you, I owe not less than He commanded who so loved us as to bear the shame of the
cross for our sakes.</P>

<P>2. Be not, however, surprised that I have so long forborne from addressing your Benevolence; for I
did not think that your views were such as were with great joy declared to me by brother Evodius,
whose testimony I cannot but believe. For he tells me that, when you met accidentally at the same
house, and conversation began between you concerning our hope, that is to say, the inheritance of
Christ, you were kindly pleased to say that you were willing to have a conference with me in the
presence of good men. I am truly glad that you have condescended to make this proposal: and I can in
no wise forego so important an opportunity, given by your kindness, of using whatever strength the
Lord may be pleased to give me in considering and debating with you what has been the cause, or
source, or reason of a division so lamentable and deplorable in that Church of Christ to which He
said: "Peace I give you, my peace I leave unto you.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3093_1216604">121</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3. I heard from the brother aforesaid that you had complained of his having said something in
answer to you in an insulting manner; but, I pray you, do not regard it as an insult, for I am sure
it did not proceed from an overbearing spirit, as I know my brother well. But if, in disputing in
defence of his own faith and the Church's love, he spoke perchance with a degree of warmth something
which you regarded as wounding your dignity, that deserves to be called, not contumacy, but boldness.
For he desired to debate and discuss the question, not to be merely submitting to you and flattering
you. For such flattery is the oil of the sinner, with which the prophet does not desire to have his
head anointed; for he saith: "The righteous shall correct me in compassion, and rebuke me; but the
oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3095_1217468">122</A></SUP> For he prefers to be corrected by the stem
compassion of the righteous, rather than to be commended with the soothing oil of flattery. Hence
also the saying of the prophet: "They who pronounce you happy cause you to err."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3096_1217710">123</A></SUP> Therefore also it is commonly and justly said of
a man whom false compliments have made proud, "his head has grown;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3097_1217880">124</A></SUP> for it has been increased by the oil of the
sinner, that is, not of one correcting with stern truth, hut of one commending with smooth flattery.
Do not, however, suppose me to mean by this, that I wish it to be understood that you have been
corrected by brother Evodius, as by a righteous man; for I fear lest you should think that anything
is spoken by me also in an! insulting manner, against which I desire to the utmost of my power to be
on guard. But He: is righteous who hath said, "I am the truth.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3098_1218407">125</A></SUP> When, therefore, any true word has been uttered,
though it may be somewhat rudely, by the mouth of any man, we are corrected not by the speaker, who
may perhaps be not less a sinner than ourselves, but by the truth itself, that is to say, by Christ
who is righteous, lest the unction of smooth but pernicious flattery, which is the oil of the sinner,
should anoint our head. Although, therefore, brother Evodius, through undue excitement in defending
the communion to which he belongs, may have said something too vehemently through strong feeling, you
ought to excuse him on the ground of his age, and of the importance of the matter in his
estimation.</P>

<P>4. I beseech you, however, to remember what you have been pleased to promise; namely, to
investigate amicably with me a matter of so great importance, and so closely pertaining to the common
salvation, in the presence of such spectators as you may choose (provided only that our words are not
uttered so as to be lost, but are taken down with the pen; so that we may conduct the discussion in a
more calm and orderly manner, and anything spoken by us which escapes the memory may be recalled by
reading the notes taken). Or, if you prefer it, we may discuss the matter without the interference of
any third party, by means of letters or conference and reading, wherever you please, lest perchance
some hearers, unwisely zealous, should be more concerned with the expectation of a conflict between
us, than the thought of our mutual profit by the discussion. Let the people, however, be afterwards
informed through us of the debate, when it is concluded; or, if you prefer to have the matter
discussed by letters exchanged, let these letters be read to the two congregations, in order that
they may yet come to be no longer divided, but one. In fact, I willingly accede to whatever terms you
wish, or prescribe, or prefer. And as to the sentiments of my most blessed and venerable father
Valerius, who is at present from home, I undertake with fullest confidence that he will hear of this
with great joy; for I know how much he loves peace, and how free he is from being influenced by any
paltry regard for vain parade of dignity.</P>

<P>5. I ask you, what have we to do with the dissensions of a past generation? Let it suffice that
the wounds which the bitterness of proud men inflicted on our members have remained until now; for we
have, through the lapse of time, ceased to feel the pain to remove which the physician's help is
usually sought. You see how great and miserable is the calamity by which the peace of Christian homes
and families is broken. Husbands and wives, agreeing together at the family hearth, are divided at
the altar of Christ. By Him they pledge themselves to be at peace between themselves, yet in Him they
cannot be at peace. Children have the same home, but not the same house of God, with their own
parents. They desire to be secure of the earthly inheritance of those with whom they wrangle
concerning the inheritance of Christ. Servants and masters divide their common Lord, who took on Him
the form of a servant that He might deliver all from bondage. Your party honours us, and our party
honours you. Your members appeal to us by our episcopal insignia,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3101_1221662">126</A></SUP> and our members show the same respect to you. We
receive the words of all, we desire to give offence to none. Why then, finding cause of offence in
none besides, do we find it in Christ, whose members we rend asunder? When we may be serviceable to
men that are desirous of terminating through our help disputes concerning secular affairs, they
address us as saints and servants of God, in order that they may have their questions as to property
disposed of by us: let us at length, unsolicited, take up a matter which concerns both our own
salvation and theirs. It is not about gold or silver, or land, or cattle,matters concerning which we
are daily saluted with lowly respect, in order that we may bring disputes to a peaceful
termination,-but it is concerning our Head Himself that this dissension, so unworthy and pernicious,
exists between us. However low they bow their heads who salute us in the hope that we may make them
agree together in regard to the things of this world, our Head stooped from heaven even to the cross,
and yet we do not agree together in Him.</P>

<P>6. I beg and beseech you, if there be in you that brotherly feeling for which some give you
credit, let your goodness be approved sincere, and not feigned with a view to passing honours, by
this, that your bowels of compassion be moved, so that you consent to have this matter discussed;
joining with me in persevering prayer, and in peaceful discussion of every point. Let not the respect
paid by the unhappy people to our dignities be found, in the judgment of God, aggravating our
condemnation; rather let them be recalled along with us, through our unfeigned love, from errors and
dissensions, and guided into the ways of truth and peace.</P>

<P>My lord, honourable and most beloved, I pray that you may be blessed in the sight of God.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XXXIV.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 396.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Eusebius, My Excellent Lord and Brother, Worthy of Affection and Esteem, Augustin
Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. God, to whom the secrets of the heart of man are open, knoweth that it is because of my
love for Christian peace that I am so deeply moved by the profane deeds of those who basely and
impiously persevere in dissenting from it. He knoweth also that this feeling of mine is one tending
towards peace, and that my desire is, not that any one should against his will be coerced into the
Catholic communion, but that to all who are in error the truth may be openly declared, and being by
God's help clearly exhibited through my ministry, may so commend itself as to make them embrace and
follow it.</P>

<P>2. Passing many other things unnoticed, what could be more worthy of detestation than what has
just happened? A young man is reproved by his bishop for frequently beating his mother like a madman,
and not restraining his impious hands from wounding her who bore him, even on those days on which the
sternness of law shows mercy to the most guilty criminals.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3110_1224559">127</A></SUP> He then threatens his mother that he would pass
to the party of the Donatists, and that he would kill her whom he is accustomed to beat with
incredible ferocity. He utters these threats, then passes over to the Donatists, and is rebaptized
while filled with wicked rage, and is arrayed in white vestments while he is burning to shed his
mother's blood. He is placed in a prominent and conspicuous position within the railing in the
church; and to the eyes of sorrowful and indignant beholders, he who is purposing matricide is
exhibited as a regenerate man.</P>

<P>3. I appeal to you, as a man of most mature judgment, can these things find favour in your eyes? I
do not believe this of you: I know your wisdom. A mother is wounded by her son in the members of that
body which bore and nursed the ungrateful wretch; and when the Church, his spiritual mother,
interferes, she too is wounded in those sacraments by which, to the same ungrateful son, she
ministered life and nourishment. Do you not seem to hear the young man gnashing his teeth in rage for
a parent's blood, and saying, "What shall I do to the Church which forbids my wounding my mother? I
have found out what to do: let the Church herself be wounded by such blows as she can suffer; let
that be done in me which may cause her members pain. Let me go to those who know how to despise the
grace with which she gave me spiritual birth, and to mar the form which in her womb I received. Let
me vex both my natural and my spiritual mother with cruel tortures: let the one who was the second to
give me birth be the first to give me burial; for her sorrow let me seek spiritual death, and for the
other's death let me prolong my natural life." Oh, Eusebius! I appeal to you as an honourable man,
what else may we expect than that now he shall feel himself, as a Donatist, so armed as to have no
fear in assailing that unhappy woman, decrepit with age and helpless in her widowhood, from wounding
whom he was restrained while he remained a Catholic? For what else had he purposed in his passionate
heart when he said to his mother, "I will pass over to the party of Donatus, and I will drink your
blood?" Behold, arrayed in white vestments, but with conscience crimson with blood, he has fulfilled
his threat in part; the other part remains, viz. that he drink his mother's blood. If, therefore,
these things find favour in your eyes, let him be urged by those who are now his clergy and his
sanctifiers to fulfil within eight days the remaining portion of his vow.</P>

<P>4. The Lord's right hand indeed is strong, so that He may keep back this man's rage from that
unhappy and desolate widow, and, by means known unto His own wisdom, may deter him from his impious
design; but could I do otherwise than utter my feelings when my heart was pierced with such grief?
Shall they do such things, and am I to be commanded to hold my peace? When He commands me by the
mouth of the apostle saying that those who teach what they ought not must be rebuked by the
bishop,<SUP><A HREF="#P3113_1227609">128</A></SUP> shall I be silent through dread
of their displeasure? The Lord deliver me from such folly! As to my desire for having such an impious
crime recorded in our public registers, it was desired by me chiefly for this end, that no one who
may hear me bewailing these proceedings, especially in other towns where it may be expedient for me
to do so, may think that I am inventing a falsehood, and the rather, because in Hippo itself it is
already affirmed that Proculeianus did not issue the order which was in the official report ascribed
to him.</P>

<P>5. In what more temperate way could we dispose of this important matter than through the mediation
of such a man as you, invested with most illustrious rank, and possessing calmness as well as great
prudence and goodwill? I beg, therefore, as I have already done by our brethren, good and honourable
men, whom I sent to your Excellency, that you will condescend to inquire whether it is the case that
the presbyter Victor did not receive from his bishop the order which the public official records
reported; or whether, since Victor himself has said otherwise, they have in their records laid a
thing falsely to his charge, though they belong to the same communion with him. Or, if he consents to
our calmly discussing the whole question of our differences, in order that the error which is already
manifest may become yet more so, I willingly embrace the opportunity. For I have heard that he
proposed that without popular tumult, in the presence only of ten esteemed and honourable men from
each party, we should investigate what is the truth in this matter according to the Scriptures. As to
another proposal which some have reported to me as made by him, that I should rather go to
Constantina,<SUP><A HREF="#P3115_1229368">129</A></SUP> because in that town his
party was more numerous; or that I should go to Milevis, because there, as they say, they are soon to
hold a council;-these things are absurd, for my special charge does not extend beyond the Church of
Hippo. The whole importance of this question to me, in the first place, is as it affects Proculeianus
and myself; and if, perchance, he thinks himself not a match for me, let him implore the aid of any
one whom he pleases as his colleague in the debate. For in other towns we interfere with the affairs
of the Church only so far as is permitted or enjoined by our brethren bearing the same priestly
office with us, the bishops of these towns.</P>

<P>6. And yet I cannot comprehend what there is in me, a novice, that should make him, who calls
himself a bishop of so many years' standing, unwilling and afraid to enter into discussion with me.
If it be my acquaintance with liberal studies, which perhaps he did not pursue at all, or at least
not so much as I have done, what has this to do with the question in debate, which is to be decided
by the Holy Scriptures or by ecclesiastical or public documents, with which he has for so many years
been conversant, that he ought to be more skilled in them than I am? Once more, I have here my
brother and colleague Samsucius, bishop of the Church of Turris,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3117_1230737">130</A></SUP> who has not learned any of those branches of
culture of which he is said to be afraid: let him attend in my place, and let the debate be between
them. I will ask him, and, as I trust in the name of Christ, he will readily consent to take my place
in this matter; and the Lord will, I trust, give aid to him when contending for the truth: for
although unpolished in language, he is well instructed in the true faith. There is therefore no
reason for his referring me to others whom I do not know, instead of letting us settle between
ourselves that which concerns ourselves. However, as I have said, I will not decline meeting them if
he himself asks their assistance.</P>

<P>(Another letter to Eusebius on the same subject.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Eusebius, My Excellent Lord and Brother, Worthy of Affection and Esteem, Augustin
Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I did not impose upon you, by importunate exhortation or entreaty in spite of your
reluctance, the duty, as you call it, of arbitrating between bishops. Even if I had desired to move
you to this, I might perhaps have easily shown how competent you are to judge between us in a cause
so clear and simple; nay, I might show how you are already doing this, inasmuch as you, who are
afraid of the office of judge, do not hesitate to pronounce sentence in favour of one of the parties
before you have heard both. But of this, as I have said, I do not meanwhile say anything. For I had
asked nothing else from your honourable good-nature,-and I beseech you to be pleased to remark it in
this letter, if you did not in the former,-than that you should ask Proculeianus whether he himself
said to his presbyter Victor that which the public registers have by official report ascribed to him,
or whether those who were sent have written in the public registers not what they heard from Victor,
but a falsehood; and further, what his opinion is as to our discussing the whole question between us.
I think that he is not constituted judge between parties, who is only requested by the one to put a
question to the other, and condescend to write what reply he has received. This also I now again ask
you not to refuse to do, because, as I know by experiment, he does not wish to receive a letter from
me, otherwise I would not employ your Excellency's mediation. Since, therefore, he does not wish
this, what could I do less likely to give offence, than to apply through you, so good a man and such
a friend of his, for an answer concerning a matter about which the burden of my responsibility
forbids me to hold my peace? Moreover, you say (because the son's beating of his mother is
disapproved by your sound judgment), "If Proculeianus had known this, he would have debarred that man
from communion with his party." I answer in a sentence, "He knows it now, let him now debar him."</P>

<P>2. Let me mention another thing. A man who was formerly a subdeacon of the church at Spana, Primus
by name, when, having been forbidden such intercourse with nuns as contravened the laws of the
Church,<SUP><A HREF="#P3125_1233787">131</A></SUP> he treated with contempt the
established and wise regulations, was deprived of his clerical office,-this man also, being provoked
by the divinely warranted discipline, went over to the other party, and was by them rebaptized. Two
nuns also, who were settled in the same lands of the Catholic Church with him, either taken by him to
the other party, or following him, were likewise rebaptized: and now, among bands of Circumcelliones
and troops of homeless women, who have declined matrimony that they may avoid restraint, he proudly
boasts himself in excesses of detestable revelry, rejoicing that he now has without hindrance the
utmost freedom in that misconduct from which in the Catholic Church he was restrained. Perhaps
Proculeianus knows nothing about this case either. Let it therefore through you, as a man of grave
and dispassionate spirit, be made known to him; and let him order that man to be dismissed from his
communion, who has chosen it for no other reason than that he had, on account of insubordination and
dissolute habits, forfeited his clerical office in the Catholic Church.</P>

<P>3. For my own part, if it please the Lord, I purpose to adhere to this rule, that whoever, after
being deposed among them by a sentence of discipline, shall express a desire to pass over into the
Catholic Church, must be received on condition of submitting to give the same proofs of penitence as
those which, perhaps, they would have constrained him to give if he had remained among them. But
consider, I beseech you, how worthy of abhorrence is their procedure in regard to those whom we check
by ecclesiastical censures for unholy living, persuading them first to come to a second baptism, in
order to their being qualified for which they declare themselves to be pagans (and how much blood of
martyrs has been poured out rather than that such a declaration should proceed from the mouth of a
Christian!); and thereafter, as if renewed and sanctified, but in truth more hardened in sin, to defy
with the impiety of new madness, under the guise of new grace, that discipline to which they could
not submit. If, however, I am wrong in attempting to obtain the correction of these abuses through
your benevolent interposition, let no one find fault with my causing them to be made known to
Proculeianus by the public registers,-a means of notification which in this Roman city cannot, I
believe, be refused to me. For, since the Lord commands us to speak and proclaim the truth, and in
teaching to rebuke what is wrong, and to labour in season and out of season, as I can prove by the
words of the Lord and of the apostles,<SUP><A HREF="#P3127_1236458">132</A></SUP>
let no man think that I am to be persuaded to be silent concerning these things. If they meditate any
bold measures of violence or outrage, the Lord, who has subdued under His yoke all earthly kingdoms
in the bosom of His Church spread abroad through the whole world, will not fail to defend her from
wrong.</P>

<P>4. The daughter of one of the cultivators of the property of the Church here, who had been one of
our catechumens, had been, against the will of her parents, drawn away by the other party, and after
being baptized among them, had assumed the profession of a nun. Now her father wished to compel her
by severe treatment to return to the Catholic Church; but I was unwilling that this woman, whose mind
was so perverted, should be received by us unless with her own will, and choosing, in the free
exercise of judgment, that which is better: and when the countryman began to attempt to compel his
daughter by blows to submit to his authority, I immediately forbade his using any such means.
Notwithstanding, after all, when I was passing through the Spanian district, a presbyter of
Proculeianus, standing in a field belonging to an excellent Catholic woman, shouted after me with a
most insolent voice that I was a Traditor and a persecutor; and he hurled the same reproach against
that woman, belonging to our communion, on whose property he was standing. But when I heard his
words, I not only refrained from pursuing the quarrel, but also held back the numerous company which
surrounded me. Yet if I say, Let us inquire and ascertain who are or have been indeed Traditors and
persecutors, they reply, "We will not debate, but we will rebaptize. Leave us to prey upon your
flocks with crafty cruelty, like wolves; and if you are good shepherds, bear it in silence." For what
else has Proculeianus commanded but this, if indeed the order is justly ascribed to him: "If thou art
a Christian,". said he, "leave this to the judgment of God; whatever we do, hold thou thy peace." The
same presbyter, moreover, dared to utter a threat against a countryman who is overseer of one of the
farms belonging to the Church.</P>

<P>5. I pray you to inform Proculeianus of all these things. Let him repress the madness of his
clergy, which, honoured Eusebius, I have! felt constrained to report to you. Be pleased to write to
me, not your own opinion concerning them all, lest you should think that the responsibility of a
judge is laid upon you by me, but the answer which they give to my questions. May the mercy of God
preserve you from harm, my excellent lord and brother, most worthy of affection and esteem.</P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 396.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Brother and Fellow-Presbyter Casulanus, Most Beloved and Longed For, Augustin Sends
Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. I know not how it was that I did not reply to your first letter; but I know that my neglect was
not owing to want of esteem for you. For I take pleasure in your studies, and even in the words in
which you express your thoughts; and it is my desire as well as advice that you make great
attainments in your early years in the word of God, for the edification of the Church. Having now
received a second letter from you, in which you plead for an answer on the most just and amiable
Found of that brotherly love in which we are one, I have resolved no longer to postpone the
gratification of the desire expressed by your love; and although in the midst of most engrossing
business, I address myself to discharge the debt due to you.</P>

<P>2. As to the question on which you wish my opinion, "whether it is lawful to fast on the seventh
day of the week,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3137_1240086">133</A></SUP> I answer, that if it
were wholly unlawful, neither Moses nor Elijah, nor our Lord Himself, would have fasted for forty
successive days. But by the same argument it is proved that even on the Lord's day fasting is not
unlawful. And yet, if any one were to think that the Lord's day should be appointed a day of fasting,
in the same way as! the seventh day is observed by some, such a man would be regarded, and not
unjustly, as bringing a great cause of offence into the Church. For in those things concerning which
the divine Scriptures have laid down no definite rule, the custom of the people of God, or the
practices instituted by their fathers, are to be held as the law of the Church.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3138_1240792">134</A></SUP> If we choose to fall into a debate about these
things, and to denounce one party merely because their custom differs from that of others, the
consequence must be an endless contention, in which the utmost care is necessary lest the storm of
conflict overcast with clouds the calmness of brotherly love, while strength is spent in mere
controversy which cannot adduce on either side any decisive testimonies of truth. This danger the
author has not been careful to avoid, whose prolix dissertation you deemed worth sending to me with
your former letter, that I might answer his arguments.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. I have not at my disposal sufficient leisure to enter on the refutation of his opinions one by
one: my time is demanded by other and more important work. But if you devote a little more carefully
to this treatise of an anonymous Roman author,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3141_1241812">135</A></SUP> the talents which by your letters you prove
yourself to possess, and which I greatly love in you as God's gift, you will see that he has not
hesitated to wound by his most injurious language almost the whole Church of Christ, from the rising
of the sun to its going down. Nay, I may say not almost, but absolutely, the whole Church. For he is
found to have not even spared the Roman Christians, whose custom he seems to himself to defend; but
he is not aware how the force of his invectives recoils upon them, for it has escaped his
observation. For when arguments to prove the obligation to fast on the seventh day of the week fail
him, he enters on a vehement blustering protest against the excesses of banquets and drunken
revelries, and the worst licence of intoxication, as if there were no medium between fasting and
rioting. Now if this be admitted, what good can fasting on Saturday do to the Romans? since on the
other days on which they do not fast they must be presumed, according to his reasoning, to be
gluttonous, and given to excess in wine. If, therefore, there is any difference between loading the
heart with surfeiting and drunkenness, which is always sinful, and relaxing the strictness of
fasting, with due regard to self-restraint and temperance on the other, which is done on the Lord's
day without censure from any Christian,-if, I say, there is a difference between these two things,
let him first mark the distinction between the repasts of saints and the excessive eating and
drinking of those whose god is their belly, lest he charge the Romans themselves with belonging to
the latter class on the days on which they do not fast; and then let him inquire, not whether it is
lawful to indulge in drunkenness on the seventh day of the week, which is not lawful on the Lord's
day, but whether it is incumbent on us to fast on the seventh day of the week, which we are not wont
to do on the Lord's day.</P>

<P>4. This question I would wish to see him investigate, and resolve in such a manner as would not
involve him in the guilt of openly speaking against the whole Church diffused throughout the world,
with the exception of the Roman Christians, and hitherto a few of the Western communities. Is it, I
ask, to be endured among the entire Eastern Christian communities, and many of those in the West,
that this man should say of so many and so eminent servants of Christ, who on the seventh day of the
week refresh themselves soberly and moderately with food, that they "are in the flesh, and cannot
please God;" and that of them it is written, "Let the wicked depart from me, I will not know their
way;" and that they make their belly their god, that they prefer Jewish rites to those of the Church,
and are sons of the bondwoman; that they are governed not by the righteous law of God, but by their
own good pleasure, consulting their own appetites instead of submitting to salutary restraint; also
that they are carnal, and savour of death, and other such charges, which if he had uttered against
even one servant of God, who would listen to him, who Would not be bound to turn away from him? But
now, when he assails with such reproachful and abusive language the Church bearing fruit and
increasing throughout the whole world, and in almost all places observing no fast on the seventh day
of the week, I warn him, whoever he is, to beware. For in wishing to conceal from me his name, you
plainly showed your unwillingness that I should judge him.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>5. "The Son of man," he sap, "is Lord of the Sabbath, and in that day it is by all means lawful to
do good rather than do evil."<SUP><A HREF="#P3145_1245478">136</A></SUP> If,
therefore, we do evil when we break our fast, there is no Lord's day upon which we live as we should.
As to his admission that the apostles did eat upon the seventh day of the week, and his remark upon
this, that the time for their fasting had not then come, because of the Lord's own words, "The days
will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall the children of the
Bridegroom fast;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3146_1245923">137</A></SUP> since there is "a time
to rejoice, and a time to mourn,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3147_1246002">138</A></SUP> he
ought first to have observed, that our Lord was speaking there of fasting in general, but not of
fasting upon the seventh day. Again, when he says that by fasting grief is signified, and that by
food joy is represented, why does he not reflect what it was which God designed to signify by that
which is written, "that He rested on the seventh day from all His works,"-namely, that joy, and not
sorrow, was set forth in that rest? Unless, perchance, he intends to affirm that in God's resting and
hallowing of the Sabbath, joy was signified to the Jews, but grief to the Christians. But God did not
lay down a rule concerning fasting or eating on the seventh day of the week, either at the time of
His hallowing that day because in it He rested from His works, or afterwards, when He gave precepts
to the Hebrew nation concerning the observance of that day. The only thing enjoined on man there is,
that he abstain from doing work himself, or requiring it from his servants. And the people of the
former dispensation, accepting this rest as a shadow of things to come, obeyed the command by such
abstinence from work as we now see practised by the Jews; not, as some suppose, through their being
carnal, and misunderstanding what the Christians tightly understand. Nor do we understand this law
better than the prophets, who, at the time when this was still binding, observed such rest on the
Sabbath as the Jews believe ought to be observed to this day. Hence also it was that God commanded
them to stone to death a man who had gathered sticks on the Sabbath;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3148_1247589">139</A></SUP> but we nowhere read of any one being stoned, or
deemed worthy of any punishment whatever, for either fasting or eating on the Sabbath. Which of the
two is more in keeping with rest, and which with toil, let our author himself decide, who has
regarded joy as the portion of those who eat, and sorrow as the portion of those who fast, or at
least has understood that these things were so regarded by the Lord, when, giving answer concerning
fasting, He said: "Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with
them?"<SUP><A HREF="#P3149_1248153">140</A></SUP> </P>

<P>6. Moreover, as to his assertion, that the reason of the apostles eating on the seventh day (a
thing forbidden by the tradition of the elders) was, that the time for their fasting on that day had
not come; I ask, if the time had not then come for the abolition of the Jewish rest from work on that
day? Did not the tradition of the elders prohibit fasting on the one hand, and enjoin rest on the
other? and.yet the disciples of Christ, of whom we read that they did eat on the Sabbath, did on the
same day pluck the ears of corn, which was not then lawful, because forbidden by the tradition of the
elders. Let him therefore consider whether it might not with more reason be said in reply to him,
that the Lord desired to have these two things, the plucking of the ears of corn and the taking of
food, done in the same day by His disciples, for this reason, that the former action might confute
those who would prohibit all work on the seventh day, and the latter action confute those who would
enjoin fasting on the seventh day; since by the former action He taught that the rest from labour was
now, through the change in the dispensation, an act of superstition; and by the latter He intimated
His will, that under both dispensations the matter of fasting or not was left to every man's choice.
I do not say this by way of argument in support of my view, but only to show how, in answer to him,
things much more forcible than what he has spoken might be advanced.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>7. "How shall we," says our author, "escape sharing the condemnation of the Pharisee, if we fast
twice in the week?"<SUP><A HREF="#P3153_1249766">141</A></SUP> As if the Pharisee
had been condemned for fasting twice in the week, and not for proudly vaunting himself above the
publican. He might as well! say that those also are condemned with that Pharisee, who give a tenth of
all their possessions to the poor, for he boasted of this among his other works; whereas I would that
it were done by many Christians, instead of a very small number, as we find. Or let him say, that
whosoever is not an unjust man, or adulterer, or extortioner, must be condemned with that Pharisee,
because he boasted that he was none of these; but the man who could think thus is, beyond question,,
beside himself. Moreover, if these things which the Pharisee mentioned as found in him, being
admitted by all to be good in themselves, are not to be retained with the haughty boastfulness which
was manifest in him, but are to be retained with the lowly piety which was not in him; by I the same
rule, to fast twice in the week is in a man such as the Pharisee unprofitable, but is in one who has
humility and faith a religious service. Moreover, after all, the Scripture does not say that the
Pharisee was condemned, but only that the publican was "justified rather than the other."</P>

<P>8. Again, when our author insists upon interpreting, in connection with this matter, the words of
the Lord, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3155_1251238">142</A></SUP> and thinks that we cannot fulfil this precept
unless we fast oftener than twice in the week, let him mark well that there are seven days in the
week. If, then, from these any one subtract two, not fasting on the seventh day nor on the Lord's
day, there remain five days in which he may surpass the Pharisee, who fasts but twice in the week.
For I think that if any man fast three times in the week, he already surpasses the Pharisee who
fasted but twice. And if a fast is observed four times, or even so often as five times, passing over
only the seventh day and the Lord's day without fasting,-a practice observed by many through their
whole lifetime, especially by those who are settled in monasteries,-by this not the Pharisee alone is
surpassed in the labour of fasting, but that Christian also whose custom is to fast on the fourth,
and sixth, and seventh days, as the Roman community does to a large extent. And yet your nameless
metropolitan disputant calls such an one carnal, even though for five successive days of the week,
excepting the seventh and the Lord's day, he so fast as to withhold all refection from the body; as
if, forsooth, food and drink on other days had nothing to do with the flesh, and condemns him as
making a god of his belly, as if it was only the seventh day's repast which entered into the
belly.</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>We have no compunction in passing over about eight columns here of this letter, in
which Augustin exposes, with a tedious minuteness and with a waste of rhetoric, other feeble and
irrelevant puerilities of the Roman author whose work Casulanus had submitted to his review. Instead
of accompanying him into the shallow places into which he was drawn while pursuing such an
insignificant foe, let us resume the translation at the point at which Augustin gives his own opinion
regarding the question whether it is binding on Christians to fast on Saturday.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Chap. XI.</P>

<P>25. As to the succeeding paragraphs with which he concludes his treatise, they are, like some
other things in it which I have not thought worthy of notice, even more irrelevant to a discussion of
the question whether we should fast or eat on the seventh day of the week. But I leave it to
yourself, especially if you have found any help from what I have already said, to observe and dispose
of these. Having now to the best of my ability, and as I think sufficiently, replied to the
reasonings of this author, if I be asked what is my own opinion in this matter, I answer, after
carefully pondering the question, that in the Gospels and Epistles, and the entire collection of
books for our instruction called the New Testament, I see that fasting is enjoined. But I do not
discover any rule definitely laid down by the Lord or by the apostles as to days on which we ought or
ought not to fast. And by this I am persuaded that exemption from fasting on the seventh day is more
suitable, not indeed to obtain, but to foreshadow, that eternal rest in which the true Sabbath is
realized, and which is obtained only by faith, and by that righteousness whereby the daughter of the
King is all glorious within.</P>

<P>26. In this question, however, of fasting or not fasting on the seventh day, nothing appears to me
more safe and conducive to peace than the apostle's rule: "Let not him that eateth despise him that
eateth not, and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth:"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3163_1254623">143</A></SUP> "for neither if we eat are we the better,
neither if we eat not are we the worse;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3164_1254727">144</A></SUP>
our fellowship with those among whom we live, and along with whom we live in God, being preserved
undisturbed by these things. For as it is true that, in the words of the apostles, "it is evil for
that man who eateth with offence,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3165_1254983">145</A></SUP> it is
equally true that it is evil for that man who fasteth with offence. Let us not therefore be like
those who, seeing John the Baptist neither eating nor drinking, said, "He hath a devil;" but let us
equally avoid imitating those who said, when they saw Christ eating and drinking, "Behold a man
gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3166_1255370">146</A></SUP> After mentioning these sayings, the Lord
subjoined a most important truth in the words, "But Wisdom is justified of her children;" and if you
ask who these are, read what is written, "The sons of Wisdom are the congregation of the
righteous:"<SUP><A HREF="#P3167_1255635">147</A></SUP> they are they who, when the,
eat, do not despise others who do not eat; and when they eat not, do not judge those who eat, but who
do despise and judge those who, with offence, either eat or abstain from eating.</P>

<P>Chap. XII.</P>

<P>27. As to the seventh day of the week there is less difficulty in acting on the rule above quoted,
because both the Roman Church and some other churches, though few, near to it or remote from it,
observe a fast on that day; but to fast on the Lord's day is a great offence, especially since the
rise of that detestable heresy of the Manichaeans, so manifestly and grievously contradicting the
Catholic faith and the divine Scriptures: for the Manichaeans have prescribed to their followers the
obligation of fasting upon that day; whence it has resulted that the fast upon the Lord's day is
regarded with the greater abhorrence. Unless, perchance, some one be able to continue an unbroken
fast for more than a week, so as to approach as nearly as may be to the fast of forty days, as we
have known some do; and we have even been assured by brethren most worthy of credit, that one person
did attain to the full period of forty days. For as, in the time of the Old Testament fathers, Moses
and Elijah did not do anything against liberty of eating on the seventh day of the week, when they
fasted forty days; so the man who has been able to go beyond seven days in fasting has not chosen the
Lord's day as a day of fasting, but has only come upon it in course among the days for which, so far
as he might be able, he had vowed to prolong his fast. If, however, a continuous fast is to be
concluded within a week, there is no day upon which it may more suitably be concluded than the Lord's
day; but if the body is not refreshed until more than a week has elapsed, the Lord's day is not in
that case selected as a day of fasting, but is found occurring within the number of days for which it
had seemed good to the person to make a vow.</P>

<P>28. Be not moved by that which the Priscillianists<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3171_1257664">148</A></SUP> (a sect very like the Manichaeans) are wont to
quote as an argument from the Acts of the Apostles, concerning what was done by the Apostle Paul in
Troas. The passage is as follows: "Upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together
to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech
until midnight."<SUP><A HREF="#P3172_1258262">149</A></SUP> Afterwards, when he had
come down from the supper chamber where they had been gathered together, that he might restore the
young man who, overpowered with sleep, had fallen from the window and was taken up dead, the
Scripture states further concerning the apostle:" When he therefore was come up again, and had broken
bread, and eaten and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3173_1258683">150</A></SUP> Far be it from us to accept this as affirming
that the apostles were accustomed to fast habitually on the Lord's day. For the day now known as the
Lord's day was then called the first day of the week, as is more plainly seen in the Gospels; for the
day of the Lord's resurrection is called by Matthew <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>mia sabba/twn</FONT>, and by
the other three evangelists <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>h9 mi/a (tw=n) sabba/twn</FONT>,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3174_1259081">151</A></SUP> and it is well ascertained that the same is the
day which is now called the Lord's day. Either, therefore, it was after the close of the seventh day
that they had assembled,-namely, in the beginning of the night which followed, and which belonged to
the Lord's day, or the first day of the week,-and in this case the apostle, before proceeding to
break bread with them, as is done in the sacrament of the body of Christ, continued his discourse
until midnight, and also, after celebrating the sacrament, continued still speaking again to those
who were assembled, being much pressed for time in order that he might set out at dawn upon the
Lord's day; or if it was on the first day of the week, at an hour before sunset on the Lord's day,
that they had assembled, the words of the text, "Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the
morrow," themselves expressly state the reason for his prolonging! his discourse,-namely, that he was
about to! leave them, and wished to give them ample instruction. The passage does not therefore prove
that they habitually fasted on the Lord's day, but only that it did not seem meet to the apostle to
interrupt, for the sake of taking refreshment, an important discourse, which was listened to with the
ardour of most lively interest by persons whom he was about to leave, and whom, on account of his
many other journeyings, he visited but seldom, and perhaps on no other occasion than this, especially
because, as subsequent events prove, he was then leaving them without expectation of seeing them
again in this life. Nay, by this instance, it is rather proved that such fasting on the Lord's day
was not customary, because the writer of the history, in order to prevent this being thought, has
taken care to state the reason why the discourse was so prolonged, that we might know that in an
emergency dinner is not to stand in the way of more important work. But indeed the example of these
most eager listeners goes further; for by them all bodily refreshment, not dinner only, but supper
also, was disregarded when thirsting vehemently, not for water, but for the word of truth; and
considering that the fountain was about to be removed from them, they drank in with unabated desire
whatever flowed from the apostle's lips.</P>

<P>29. In that age, however, although fasting upon the Lord's day was not usually practised, it was
not so great an offence to the Church when, in any similar emergency to that in which Paul was at
Troas, men did not attend to the refreshment of the body throughout the whole of the Lord's day until
midnight, or even until the dawn of the following morning. But now, since heretics, and especially
these most impious Manichaeans, have begun not to observe an occasional fast upon the Lord's day,
when constrained by circumstances, but to prescribe such fasting as a duty binding by sacred and
solemn institution, and this practice of theirs has become well known to Christian communities; even
were such an emergency arising as that which the apostle experienced, I verily think that what he
then did should not now be done, lest the harm done by the offence given should be greater than the
good received from the words spoken. Whatever necessity may arise, or good reason, compelling a
Christian to fast on the Lord's day,-as we find, <I>e.g.</I>, in the Acts of the Apostles, that in
peril of shipwreck they fasted on board of the ship in which the apostle was for fourteen days
successively, within which the Lord's day came round twice,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3176_1262718">152</A></SUP> -we ought to have no hesitation in believing
that the Lord's day is not to be placed among the days of voluntary fasting, except in the case of
one vowing to fast continuously for a period longer than a week.</P>

<P>Chap. XIII.</P>

<P>30. The reason why the Church prefers to appoint the fourth and sixth days of the week for
fasting, is found by considering the gospel narrative. There we find that on the fourth day of the
week<SUP><A HREF="#P3179_1263156">153</A></SUP> the Jews took counsel to put the
Lord to death. One day having intervened,-on the evening of which, at the close, namely, of the day
which we call the fifth day of the week, the Lord ate the passover with His disciples,-He was
thereafter betrayed on the night which belonged to the sixth day of the week, the day (as is
everywhere known) of His passion. This day, beginning with the evening, was the first day of
unleavened bread. The evangelist Matthew, however, says that the fifth day of the week was the first
of unleavened bread, because in the evening following it the paschal supper was to be observed, at
which they began to eat the unleavened bread, and the lamb offered in sacrifice. From which it is
inferred that it was upon the fourth day of the week that the Lord said, "You know that after two
days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3180_1264087">154</A></SUP> and for this reason that day has been regarded
as one suitable for fasting, because, as the evangelist immediately adds: "Then assembled together
the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest,
who is called Caiaphas, and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty and kill Him."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3181_1264447">155</A></SUP> After the intermission of one day,-the day,
namely, of which the evangelist writes:<SUP><A HREF="#P3182_1264557">156</A></SUP>
"Now, on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto
Him, Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the passover? "-the Lord suffered on the sixth
day of the week, as is admitted by all: wherefore the sixth day also is rightly reckoned a day for
fasting, as fasting is symbolical of humiliation; whence it is said, "I humbled my soul with
fasting."<SUP><A HREF="#P3183_1264980">157</A></SUP> </P>

<P>31. The next day is the Jewish Sabbath, on which day Christ's body rested in the grave, as in the
original fashioning of the world God rested on that day from all His works. Hence originated that
variety in the robe of His bride<SUP><A HREF="#P3185_1265231">158</A></SUP> which we
are now considering: some, especially the Eastern communities, preferring to take food on that day,
that their action might be emblematic of the divine rest; others, namely the Church of Rome, and some
churches in the West, preferring to fast on that day because of the humiliation of the Lord in death.
Once in the year, namely at Easter, all Christians observe the seventh day of the week by fasting, in
memory of the mourning with which the disciples, as men bereaved, lamented the death of the Lord (and
this is done with the utmost devoutness by those who take food on the seventh day throughout the rest
of the year); thus providing a symbolical representation of both events,-of the disciples' sorrow on
one seventh day in the year, and of the blessing of repose on all the others. There are two things
which make the happiness of the just and the end of all their misery to be confidently expected, viz.
death and the resurrection of the dead. In death is that rest of which the prophet speaks: "Come, my
people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a
little moment, until the indignation be overpast."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3186_1266427">159</A></SUP> In resurrection blessedness is consummated in
the whole man, both body and soul. Hence it came to be thought that both of these things [death and
resurrection] should be symbolized, not by the hardship of fasting, but rather by the cheerfulness of
refreshment with food, excepting only the Easter Saturday, on which, as I have said, it had been
resolved to commemorate by a more protracted fast the mourning of the disciples, as one of the events
to be had in remembrance.</P>

<P>Chap. XIV.</P>

<P>32. Since, therefore (as I have said above), we do not find in the Gospels or in the apostolical
writings, belonging properly to the revelation of the New Testament, that any law was laid down as to
fasts to be observed on particular days; and since this is consequently one of many things, difficult
to enumerate, which make up a variety in the robe of the King's daughter,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3189_1267307">160</A></SUP> that is to say, of the Church,-I will tell you
the answer given to my questions on this subject by the venerable Ambrose Bishop of Milan, by whom I
was baptized. When my mother was with md in that city, I, as being only a catechumen, felt no concern
about these questions; but it was to her a question causing anxiety, whether she ought, after the
custom of our own town, to fast on the Saturday, or, after the custom of the Church of Milan, not to
fast. To deliver her from perplexity, I put the question to the man of God whom I have just named. He
answered, "What else can I recommend to others than what I do myself?" When I thought that by this he
intended simply to prescribe to us that we should take food on Saturdays-for I knew this to be his
own practice-he, following me, added these words: "When I am here I do not fast on Saturday; but when
I am at Rome I do: whatever church you may come to, conform to its custom, if you would avoid either
receiving or giving offence." This reply I reported to my mother, and it satisfied her, so that she
scrupled not to comply with it; and I have myself followed the same rule. Since, however, it happens,
especially in Africa, that one church, or the churches within the same district, may have some
members who fast and others who do not fast on the seventh day, it seems to me best to adopt in each
congregation the custom of those to whom authority in its government has been committed. Wherefore,
if you are quite willing to follow my advice, especially because in regard to this matter I have
spoken at greater length than was necessary, do not in this resist your own bishop, but follow his
practice without scruple or debate.</P>

Lord Most Blessed, and My Father Most Worthy of Being Cherished with Respect and Sincere Affection,
Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I received the letter which your Holiness kindly sent,-a letter full of occasions of much
joy to me, because assuring me that you remember me, that you love me as you used to do, and that you
take great pleasure in every one of the gifts which the Lord has in His compassion been pleased to
bestow on me. In reading that letter, I have eagerly welcomed the fatherly affection which flows from
your benignant heart towards me: and this I have not found for the first time, as something
short-lived and new, but long ago proved and well known, my lord, most blessed, and most worthy of
being cherished with respect and sincere love.</P>

<P>2. Whence comes so great a recompense for the literary labour given by me to the writing of a few
books as this, that your Excellency should condescend to read them? Is it not that the Lord, to whom
my soul is devoted, has purposed thus to comfort me under my anxieties, and to lighten the fear with
which in such labour I cannot but be exercised, lest, notwithstanding the evenness of the plain of
truth, I stumble through want either of knowledge or of caution? For when what I write meets your
approval, I know by whom it is approved, for I know who dwells in you; and the Giver and Dispenser of
all spiritual gifts designs by your approbation to confirm my obedience to Him. For whatever in these
writings of mine merits your approbation is from God, who has by me as His instrument said, "Let it
be done," and it was done; and in your approval God has pronounced that what was done is
"good."<SUP><A HREF="#P3197_1270930">162</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3. As for the questions which you have condescended to command me to resolve, even if through the
dulness of my mind I did not understand them, I might through the assistance of your merits find an
answer to them. This only I ask, that on account of my weakness you intercede with God for me, and
that whatever writings of mine come into your sacred hands, whether on the topics to which you have
in a manner so kind and fatherly directed my attention, or on any others, you will not only take
pains to read them, but also accept the charge of reviewing and correcting them; for I acknowledge
the mistakes which I myself have made, as readily as the gifts which God has bestowed on me.</P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 397.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To His Brother Profuturus Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. As for my spirit, I am well, through the Lord's good pleasure, and the strength which He
condescends to impart; but as for my body, I am confined to bed. I can neither walk, nor stun[l, nor
sit, because of the pain and swelling of a boil or tumour.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3204_1271965">163</A></SUP> But even in such a case, since this is the will
of the Lord, what else can I say than that I am well? For if we do not wish that which He is pleased
to do, we ought rather to take blame to ourselves than to think that He could err in anything which
He either does or suffers to be done. All this you know well; but what shall I more willingly say to
you than the things which I say to myself, seeing that you are to me a second self? I commend
therefore both my days and my nights to your pious intercessions. Pray for me, that I may not waste
my days through want of self-control, and that I may bear my nights with patience: pray that, though
I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, the Lord may so be with me that I shall fear no evil.</P>

<P>2. You have heard, doubtless, of the death of the aged Megalius,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3206_1272800">164</A></SUP> for it is now twenty-four days since he put off
this mortal body. I wish to know, if possible, whether you have seen,, as you proposed, his successor
in the primacy. We are not delivered from offences, but it is equally true that we are not deprived
of our refuge; our griefs do not cease, but our consolations are equally abiding. And well do you
know, my excellent brother, how, in the midst of such offences, we must watch lest hatred of any one
gain a hold upon the heart, and so not only hinder us from praying to God with the door of our
chamber closed,<SUP><A HREF="#P3207_1273819">165</A></SUP> but also shut the door
against God Himself; for hatred of another insidiously creeps upon us, while no one who is angry
considers his anger to be unjust. For anger habitually cherished against any one becomes hatred,
since the sweetness which is mingled with what appears to be righteous anger makes us detain it
longer than we ought in the vessel, until the whole is soured, and the vessel itself is spoiled.
Wherefore it is much better for us to forbear from anger, even when one has given us just occasion
for it, than, beginning with what seems just anger against any one, to fall, through this occult
tendency of passion, into hating him. We are wont to say that, in entertaining strangers, it is much
better to bear the inconvenience of receiving a bad man than to run the risk of having a good man
shut out, through our caution test any bad man be admitted; but in the passions of the soul the
opposite rule holds true. For it is incomparably more for our soul's welfare to shut the recesses of
the heart against anger, even when it knocks with a just claim for admission, than to admit that
which it will be most difficult to expel, and which will rapidly grow from a mere sapling to a strong
tree. Anger dares to increase with boldness more suddenly than men suppose, for it does not blush in
the dark, when the sun has gone down upon it.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3208_1275188">166</A></SUP> You will understand with how great care and
anxiety I write these things, if you consider the things which lately on a Certain journey you said
to me.</P>

<P>3. I salute my brother Severus, and those who are with him. I would perhaps write to them also, if
the limited time before the departure of the bearer permitted me. I beseech you also to assist me in
persuading our brother Victor (to whom I desire through your Holiness to express my thanks for his
informing me of his setting out to Constantina) not to refuse to return by way of Calama, on account
of a business known to him, in which I have to bear a very heavy burden in the importunate urgency of
the eider Nectarius concerning it; he gave me his promise to this effect. Farewell!</P>

<P>1. Last year I sent by the hand of our brother, the subdeacon Asterius, a letter conveying to your
Excellency a salutation due to you, and readily rendered by me; and I think that my letter was
delivered to you. I now write again, by my holy brother the deacon Praesidius, begging you in the
first place not to forget me, and in the second place to receive the bearer of this letter, whom I
commend to you with the request that you recognise him as one very near and dear to me, and that you
encourage and help hint in whatever way his circumstances may demand; not that he is in need of:
anything (for Christ has amply endowed him), but that he is most eagerly desiring the friendship of
good men, and thinks that in securing: this he obtains the most valuable blessing. His design in
travelling to the West you may learn from his own lips.</P>

<P>I beseech you to give my respectful salutation to the holy and venerable brother, our father

Sincere Devotion of Charity, My Fellow-Presbyter Jerome, Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. I thank you that, instead of a mere formal salutation, you wrote me a letter, though it was
much shorter than I would desire to have from you; since nothing that comes from you is tedious,
however much time it may demand. Wherefore, although I am beset with great anxieties about the
affairs of others, and that, too, in regard to secular matters, I would find it difficult to pardon
the brevity of your letter, were it not that I consider that it was written in reply to a yet shorter
letter of my own. Address yourself, therefore, I entreat you, to that exchange of letters by which we
may have fellowship, and may not permit the distance which separates us to keep us wholly apart from
each other; though we are in the Lord bound together by the unity of the Spirit, even when our pens
rest and we are silent. The books in which you have laboured to bring treasures from the Lord's
storehouse give me almost a complete knowledge of you. For if I may not say, "I know you," because I
have not seen your face, it may with equal truth be said that you do not know yourself, for you
cannot see your own face. If, however, it is this alone which constitutes your acquaintance with
yourself, that you know your own mind, we also have no small knowledge of it through your writings,
in studying which we bless God that to yourself, to us, to all who read your works, He has given you
as you are.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>2. It is not long since, among other things, a certain book of yours came into my hands, the name
of which I do not yet know, for the manuscript itself had not the title written, as is customary, on
the first page. The brother with whom it was found said that its title is <I>Epitaphium</I>,-a name
which we might believe you to have approved, if we found in the work a notice of the lives or
writings of those only who are deceased. Inasmuch, however, as mention is there made of the works of
some who were at the time when it was written, or are even now, alive, we wonder why you either gave
this title to it, or permitted others to believe that you had done so. The book itself has our
complete approval as a useful work. </P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>3. In your exposition of the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians I have found one thing which causes
me much concern. For if it be the case that statements untrue in themselves, but made, as it were,
out of a sense of duty in the interest of religion,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3231_1280188">169</A></SUP> have been admitted into the Holy Scriptures,
what authority will be left to them? If this be conceded, what sentence can be produced from these
Scriptures, by the weight of which the wicked obstinacy of error can be broken down? For as soon as
you have produced it, if it be disliked by him who contends with you, he will reply that, in the
passage alleged, the writer was uttering a falsehood under the pressure of some honourable sense of
duty. And where will any one find this way of escape impossible, if it be possible for men to say and
believe that, after introducing his narrative with these words, "The things which I write unto you,
behold, before God, I lie not,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3232_1280899">170</A></SUP> the
apostle lied when he said of Peter and Barnabas, "I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to
the truth of the gospel "?<SUP><A HREF="#P3233_1281051">171</A></SUP> For if they
did walk uprightly, Paul wrote what was false; and if he wrote what was false <I>here</I>, when did
he say what was true? Shall he be supposed to say what is true when his teaching corresponds with the
predilection, of his reader, and shall everything which runs counter to the impressions of the reader
be! reckoned a falsehood uttered by him under a sense of duty? It will be impossible to prevent men
from finding reasons for thinking that he not only might have uttered a falsehood, but was bound to
do so, if we admit this canon of interpretation. There is no need for many words in pursuing this
argument, especially in writing to you, for whose wisdom and prudence enough has already been said. I
would by no means be so arrogant as to attempt to enrich by my small coppers<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3234_1281858">172</A></SUP> your mind, which by the divine gift is golden;
and none is more able than yourself to revise and correct that work to which I have referred.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>4. You do not require me to teach you in what sense the apostle says, "To the Jews I became as a
Jew, that I might gain the Jews,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3237_1282161">173</A></SUP> and
other such things in the same passage, which are to be ascribed to the compassion of pitying love,
not the artifices of intentional deceit. For he that ministers to the sick becomes as if he were sick
himself; not, indeed, falsely pretending to be under the fever, but considering, with the mind of one
truly sympathizing, what he would wish done for himself if he were in the sick man's place. Paul was
indeed a Jew; and when he had become a Christian, he had not abandoned those Jewish sacraments which
that people had received in the right way, and for a certain appointed time. Therefore, even although
he was an apostle of Christ, he took observing these; but with this view, that he might show that
they were in no wise hurtful to those who, even after they had believed in Christ, desired to retain
the ceremonies which by the law they had learned from their fathers; provided only that they did riot
build on these their hope of salvation, since the salvation which was foreshadowed in these has now
been brought in by the Lord Jesus. For the same reason, he judged that these ceremonies should by no
means be made binding on the Gentile converts, because, by imposing a heavy and superfluous burden,
they might turn aside from the faith those who were unaccustomed to them.</P>

<P>5. The thing, therefore, which he rebuked in Peter was not his observing the customs handed down
from his fathers-which Peter, if he wished, might do without being chargeable with deceit or
inconsistency, for, though now superfluous, these customs were not hurtful to one who bad been
accustomed to them-but his compelling the Gentiles to observe Jewish ceremonies,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3239_1283836">174</A></SUP> which he could not do otherwise than by so
acting in regard to them as if their observance was, even after the Lord's coming, still necessary to
salvation, against which truth protested through the apostolic office of Paul. Nor was the Apostle
Peter ignorant of this, but he did it through fear of those who were of the circumcision. Manifestly,
therefore, Peter was truly corrected, and Paul has given a true narrative of the event, unless, by
the admission of a falsehood here, the authority of the Holy Scriptures given for the faith of all
coming generations is to be made wholly uncertain and wavering. For it is neither possible nor
suitable to state within the compass of a letter how great and how unutterably evil must be the
consequences of such a concession. It might, however, be shown seasonably, and with less hazard, if
we were conversing together.</P>

<P>6. Paul had forsaken everything peculiar to the Jews that was evil, especially this: "That, being
ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they had not
submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3241_1284971">175</A></SUP> In this, moreover, he differed from them: that
after the passion and resurrection of Christ, in whom had been given and made manifest the mystery of
grace, according to the order of Melchizedek, they still considered it binding on them to celebrate,
not out of mere reverence for old customs, but as necessary to salvation, the sacraments of the old
economy, which were indeed at one time necessary, else had it been unprofitable and vain for the
Maccabees to suffer martyrdom, as they did, for their adherence to them.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3242_1285509">176</A></SUP> Lastly, in this also Paul differed from the
Jews: that they persecuted the Christian preachers of grace as enemies of the law. These and all
similar errors and sins he declares that he "counted but loss and dung that he might win
Christ;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3243_1285771">177</A></SUP> but he does not, in so saying,
disparage the ceremonies of the Jewish law, if only they were observed after the custom of their
fathers, in the way in which he himself observed them, without regarding them as necessary to
salvation, and not in the way in which the Jews affirmed that they must be observed, nor in the
exercise of deceptive dissimulation such as he had rebuked in Peter. For if Paul observed these
sacraments in order, by pretending to be a Jew, to gain the Jews, why did he not also take part with
the Gentiles in heathen sacrifices, when to them that were without law he became as without law, that
he might gain them also? The explanation is found in this, that he took part in the Jewish
sacrifices, as being himself by birth a Jew; and that when he said all this which I have quoted, he
meant, not that he pretended to be what he was not, but that he felt with true compassion that he
must bring such help to them as would be needful for himself if he were involved in their error.
Herein he exercised not the subtlety of a deceiver, but the sympathy of a compassionate deliverer. In
the same passage the apostle has stated the principle more generally: "To the weak became I as weak,
that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save
some,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3244_1287097">178</A></SUP> -the latter clause of which guides
us to understand the former as meaning that he showed himself one who pitied the weakness of another
as much as if it had been his own. For when he said, "Who is weak, and I am not weak?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3245_1287342">179</A></SUP> he did not wish it to be supposed that he
pretended to suffer the infirmity of another, but rather that he showed it by sympathy.</P>

<P>7. Wherefore I beseech you, apply to the correction and emendation of that book a frank and truly
Christian severity, and chant what the Greeks call <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>palinw|/dia</FONT>. For
incomparably more lovely than the Grecian Helen is Christian truth: In her defence, our martyrs have
fought against Sodom with more courage than the heroes of Greece displayed against Troy for Helen's
sake. I do not say this in order that you may recover the faculty of spiritual sight,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3247_1287946">180</A></SUP> -far be it from me to say that you have lost
it!-but that, having eyes both clear and quick in discernment, you may turn them towards that from
which, in unaccountable dissimulation, you have turned them away, refusing to see the calamitous
consequences which would follow on our once admitting that a writer of the divine books could in any
part of his work honourably and piously utter a falsehood.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>8. I had written some time ago a letter to you on this subject,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3250_1288619">181</A></SUP> which was not delivered to you, because the
bearer to whom it was entrusted did not finish his journey to you. From it I may quote a thought
which occurred to me while I was dictating it, and which I ought not to omit in this letter, in order
that, if your opinion is still different from mine, and is better, you may readily forgive the
anxiety which has moved me to write. It is this: If your opinion is different, and is according to
truth (for only in that case can it be better than mine), you will grant that "a mistake of mine,
which is in the interest of truth, cannot deserve great blame, if indeed it deserves blame at all,
when it is possible for you to use truth in the interest of falsehood without doing wrong."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3251_1289370">182</A></SUP> </P>

<P>9. As to the reply which you were pleased to give me concerning Origen, I did not need to be told
that we should, not only in ecclesiastical writers, but in all others, approve and commend what we
find right and true, but reject and condemn what we find false and mischievous. What I craved from
your wisdom and learning (and I still crave it), was that you should acquaint us definitely with the
points in which that remarkable man is proved to have departed from the belief of the truth.
Moreover, in that book in which you have mentioned all the ecclesiastical writers whom you could
remember, and their works, it would, I think, be a more convenient arrangement if, after naming those
whom you know to be heretics (since you have chosen not to pass them without notice), you would add
in what respect their doctrine is to be avoided. Some of these heretics also you have omitted, and I
would fain know on what grounds. If, however, perchance it has been from a desire not to enlarge that
volume unduly that you refrained from adding to a notice of heretics, the statement of the things in
which the Catholic Church has authoritatively condemned them, I beg you not to grudge bestowing on
this subject, to which with humility and brotherly love I direct your attention, a portion of that
literary labour by which already, by the grace of the Lord our God, you have in no small measure
stimulated and assisted the saints in the study of the Latin tongue, and publish in one small book
(if your other occupations permit you) a digest of the perverse dogmas of all the heretics who up to
this time have, through arrogance, or ignorance, or self-will, attempted to subvert the simplicity of
the Christian faith; a work most necessary for the information of those who are prevented, either by
lack of leisure or by their not knowing the Greek language, from reading and understanding so many
things. I would urge my request at greater length, were it not that this is commonly a sign of
misgivings as to the benevolence of the party from whom a favour is sought. Meanwhile I cordially
recommend to your goodwill in Christ our brother Paulus, to whose high standing in these regions I
bear before God willing testimony.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Father Aurelius, Our Lord Most Blessed and Worthy of Veneration, Our Brother Most
Sincerely Beloved, and Our Partner in I the Sacerdotal Office, Alypius and Augustin Send Greeting in
the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. "Our mouth is filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3258_1291907">183</A></SUP> by your letter informing us that, by the help of
that God whose inspiration guided you, you have carried into effect your pious purpose concerning all
our brethren in orders, and especially concerning the regular delivering of a sermon to the people in
your presence by the presbyters, through whose tongues thus engaged your love sounds louder in the
hearts than their voice does in the( ears of men. Thanks be unto God! Is there anything better for us
to have in our heart, or utter with our lips, or record with our pen, than this? Thanks be unto God!
No other phrase is more easily spoken, and nothing more pleasant in sound, profound in significance,
and profitable in practice, than this. Thanks be unto God, who has endowed you with a heart so true
to the interests of your sons, and who has brought to light what you had latent in the inner soul,
beyond the reach of human eye, giving you not only the will to do good, but the means of realizing
your desires. So be it, certainly so be it! let these works shine before men, that they may see them,
and rejoice and glorify your Father in heaven.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3259_1293032">184</A></SUP> In such things delight yourself in the Lord; and
may your prayers for these presbyters be graciously heard on their behalf by Him whose voice you do
not consider it beneath you to hear when He speaks by them! May they go on, and walk, yea, run in the
way of the Lord! May the small and the great be blessed together, being made glad by those who say
unto them, "Let us go into the house of the Lord!"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3260_1293454">185</A></SUP> Let the stronger lead; let the weaker imitate
their example, being followers of them, as they are of Christ. May we all be as ants pursuing eagerly
the path of holy industry, as bees labouring amidst the fragrance of holy duty; and may fruit be
brought forth in patience by the saving grace of sledfastness unto the end! May the Lord "not suffer
us to be tempted above that we are able, but with the temptation may He make a way to escape, that we
may be able to bear it"!<SUP><A HREF="#P3261_1293949">186</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2. Pray for us: we value your prayers as worthy to be heard, since you go to God with so great an
offering of unfeigned love, and of praise brought to Him by your works. Pray that in us also these
works may shine, for He to whom you pray knows with what fulness of joy we behold them shining in
you. Such are our desires; such are the abounding comforts which in the multitude of our thoughts
within us delight our souls.<SUP><A HREF="#P3263_1294394">187</A></SUP> It is so now
because such is the promise of God; and as He hath promised, so shall it be in the time to come. We
beseech you, by Him who hath blessed you, and has by you bestowed this blessing on the people whom
you serve, to order any of the presbyters' sermons which you please to be transcribed, and after
revisal sent to us. For I on my part am not neglecting what you required of me; and as I have written
often before, I am still longing to know what you think of Tychonius' seven Rules or Keys.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3264_1294917">188</A></SUP> </P>

<P>We warmly commend to you our brother Hilarinus, leading physician and magistrate of Hippo. As to
our brother Romanus, we know how actively you are exerting yourself on his behalf, and that we need
ask nothing but that God may prosper your endeavours.</P>

to claim the answer which your love has not yet written to us, so long and so impatiently desiring
your reply? Why have we been doomed through two summers (and these in the parched land of Africa) to
bear this thirst? What more can I say? O generous man, who art daily giving away what is your own, be
just, and pay what is a debt to us. Perhaps the reason of your long delay is your desire to finish
and transmit to me that book against heathen worship, in writing which I had heard that you were
engaged, and for which I had expressed a very earnest desire. O that you might by so rich a feast
satisfy the hunger which has been sharpened by fasting (so far as your pen was concerned) for more

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. The Apostle Paul hath said: "A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition
reject, knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth, being condemned of himself."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3278_1297055">190</A></SUP> But though the doctrine which men hold be false
and perverse, if they do not maintain it with passionate obstinacy, especially when they have not
devised it by the rashness of their own presumption, but have accepted it from parents who had been
misguided and had fallen into error, and if they are with anxiety seeking the truth, and are prepared
to be set right when they have found it, such men are not to be counted heretics. Were it not that I
believe you to be such, perhaps I would not write to you. And yet even in the case of a heretic,
however puffed up with odious conceit, and insane through the obstinacy of his wicked resistance to
truth, although we warn others to avoid him, so that he may not deceive the weak and inexperienced,
we do not refuse to strive by every means in our power for his correction. On this ground I wrote
even to some of the chief of the Donatists, not indeed letters of communion, which on account of
their perversity they have long ceased to receive from the undivided Catholic Church which is spread
throughout the world, but letters of a private kind, such as we may send even to pagans. These
letters, however, though they have sometimes read them, they have not been willing, or perhaps it is
more probable, have not been able, to answer. In these cases, it seems to me that I have discharged
the obligation laid on me by that love which the Holy Spirit teaches us to render, not only to our
own, but to all, saying by the apostle: "The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
another, and toward all men."<SUP><A HREF="#P3279_1298649">191</A></SUP> In another
place we are warned that those who are of a different opinion from us must be corrected with
meekness, "if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that
they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his
will."<SUP><A HREF="#P3280_1298981">192</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2. I have said these things by way of preface, lest any one should think, because you are not of
our communion, that I have been influenced by forwardness rather than consideration in sending this
letter, and in desiring thus to confer with you regarding the welfare of the soul; though I believe
that, if I were writing to you about an affair of property, or the settlement of some dispute about
money, no one would find fault with me. So precious is this world in the esteem of men, and so small
is the value which they set upon themselves! This letter, therefore, shall be a witness in my
vindication at the bar of God, who knows the spirit in which I write, and who has said: "Blessed are
the peacemakers: for they shall be called the sons of God."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3282_1299760">193</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. I beg you, therefore, to call to mind that, when I was in your town,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3285_1299861">194</A></SUP> and was discussing with you a little concerning
the communion of Christian unity, certain Acts were brought forward by you, from which a statement
was read aloud that about seventy bishops condemned Caecilianus, formerly our Bishop of Carthage,
along with his colleagues, and those by whom he was ordained. In the same Acts was given a full
account of the case of Felix of Aptunga, as one singularly odious and criminal. When all these had
been read, I answered that it was not to be wondered at if the men who then caused that schism, and
who did not scruple to tamper with Acts, thought that it was right to condemn those against whom they
had been instigated by envious and wicked men, although the sentence was passed without deliberation,
in the absence of the parties condemned, and without acquainting them with the matter laid to their
charge. I added that we have other ecclesiastical Acts, according to which Secundus of Tigisis, who
was for the time Primate of Numidia, left those who, being there present, confessed themselves
traditors to the judgment of God, and permitted them to remain in the episcopal sees which they then
occupied; and I stated that the names of these men are in the list of those who condemned
Caecilianus, and that this Secundus himself was president of the Council in which he secured the
condemnation of those who, being absent, were accused as traditors, by the votes of those whom he
pardoned when, being present, they confessed the same crime.</P>

<P>4. I then said that some time after the ordination of Majorinus, whom they with impious wickedness
set up against Caecilianus, raising one altar against another, and rending with infatuated
contentiousness the unity of Christ, they applied to Constantine, who was then emperor, to appoint
bishops to act as judges and arbiters concerning the questions which, having arisen in Africa,
disturbed the peace of the Church.<SUP><A HREF="#P3287_1301847">195</A></SUP> This
having been done, Caecilianus and those who had sailed from Africa to accuse him being present, and
the case tried by Melchiades, who was then Bishop of Rome, along with the assessors whom at the
request of the Donatists the Emperor had sent, nothing could be proved against Caecilianus; and thus,
while he was confirmed in his episcopal see, Donatus, who was present as his opponent, was condemned.
After all this, when they all still persevered in the obstinacy of their most sinful schism, the
Emperor being appealed to, took pains to have the matter again more carefully examined and settled at
Arles. They, however, declining an ecclesiastical decision, appealed to Constantine himself to hear
their cause. When this trial came on, both parties being present, Caecilianus was pronounced
innocent, and they retired vanquished; but they still persisted in the same perversity. At the same
time the case of Felix of Aptunga was not forgotten, and he too was acquitted of the crimes laid to
his charge, after an investigation by the proconsul at the order of the same prince.</P>

<P>5. Since, however, I was only saying these things, not reading from the record, I seemed to you to
be doing less than my earnestness had led you to expect. Perceiving this, I sent at once for that
which I had promised to read. While I went on to visit the Church at Gelizi, intending to return
thence to you, all these Acts were brought to you before two days had passed, and were read to you,
as you know, so far as time permitted, in one day. We read first how Secundus of Tigisis did not dare
to depose his colleagues in office who confessed themselves to be traditors; but afterwards, by the
help of these very men, dared to condemn, without their confessing the crime, and in their absence,
Caecilianus and others who were his colleagues. And we next read the proconsular Acts in which Felix
was, after a most thorough investigation, proved innocent. These, as you will remember, were read in
the forenoon. In the afternoon I read to you their petition to Constantine, and the ecclesiastical
record of the proceedings in Rome of the judges whom he appointed, by which the Donatists were
condemned, and Caecilianus confirmed in his episcopal dignity. In conclusion, I read the letters of
the Emperor Constantine, in which the evidence of all these things was established beyond all
possibility of dispute.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>6. What more do you ask, sirs? what more do you ask? The matter in question here is not your gold
and silver; it is not your land, nor property, nor bodily health that is at stake. I appeal to your
souls concerning their obtaining eternal life, and escaping eternal death. At length awake! I am not
handling an obscure question, nor searching into some hidden mystery, for the investigation of which
capacity is found in no human intellect, or at least in only a few: the thing is clear as day. Is
anything more obvious? could anything be more quickly seen? I affirm that parties innocent and absent
were condemned by a Council, very numerous indeed, but hasty in their decisions. I prove this by the
proconsular Acts, in which that man was wholly cleared from the charge of being a traditor, whom the
Acts of the Council which your party brought forward proclaimed as most specially guilty. I affirm
further, that the sentence against those who were said to be traditors was passed by men who had
confessed themselves guilty of that very crime. I prove this by the ecclesiastical Acts in which the
names of those men are set forth, to whom Secundus of Tigisis, professing a desire to preserve peace,
granted pardon of a crime which he knew them to have committed, and by whose help he afterwards,
notwithstanding the destruction of peace, passed sentence upon others of whose crime he had no
evidence; whereby he made it manifest that in the former decision he had been moved, not by a regard
for peace, but by fear for himself. For Purpurius, Bishop of Limata, had alleged against him that he
himself, when he had been put in custody by a curator and his soldiers, in order to compel him to
give up the Scriptures, was let go, doubtless not without paying a price, in either giving up
something, or ordering others to do so for him. He, fearing that this suspicion might be easily
enough confirmed, having obtained the advice of Secundus the younger, his own kinsman, and having
consulted all his colleagues in the episcopal office, Emitted crimes which required no proof to be
judged by God, and in so doing appeared to be protecting the peace of the Church: which was false,
for he was only protecting himself.</P>

<P>7. For if, in truth, regard for peace had any place in his heart, he would not afterwards at
Carthage have joined those traditors whom he had/eft to the judgment of God when they were present,
and confessed their fault, in passing sentence for the same crime upon others who were absent, and
against whom no one had proved the charge. He was bound, moreover, to be the more afraid on that
occasion of disturbing the peace, inasmuch as Carthage was a great and famous city, from which any
evil originating there might extend, as from the head of the body, throughout all Africa. Carthage
was also near to the countries beyond the sea, and distinguished by illustrious renown, so that it
had a bishop of more than ordinary influence, who could afford to disregard even a number of enemies
conspiring against him, because he saw himself united by letters of communion both to the Roman
Church, in which the supremacy of an apostolic chair has always flourished,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3292_1307810">196</A></SUP> and to all other lands from which Africa itself
received the gospel, and was prepared to defend himself before these Churches if his adversaries
attempted to cause an alienation of them from him. Seeing, therefore, that Caecilianus declined to
come before his colleagues, whom he perceived or suspected (or, as they affirm, pretended to suspect)
to be biassed by his enemies against the real merits of his case, it was all the more the duty of
Secundus, if he wished to be the guardian of true peace, to prevent the condemnation in! their
absence of those who had wholly declined! to compear at their bar. For it was not a matter concerning
presbyters or deacons or clergy. of inferior order, but concerning colleagues who might refer their
case wholly to the judgment of other bishops, especially of apostolical churches, in which the
sentence passed against them in their absence would have no weight, since they had not deserted their
tribunal after having compeared before it, but had always declined compearance because of the
suspicions which they entertained.</P>

<P>8. This consideration ought to have weighed much with Secundus, who was at that time Primate, if
his desire, as president of the Council, was to promote peace; for he might perhaps have quieted or
restrained the mouths of those who were raging against men who were absent, if he had spoken thus:
"Ye see, brethren, how after so great havoc of persecution peace has been given to us, through God's
mercy, by the princes of this world; surely we, being Christians and bishops, ought not to break up
the Christian unity which even pagan enemies have ceased to assail. Either, therefore, let us leave
to God, as Judge, all those cases which the calamity of a most troublous time has brought upon the
Church; or if there be some among you who have such certain knowledge of the guilt of other parties,
that they are able to bring against them a definite indictment, and prove it if they plead not
guilty, and who also shrink from having communion with such persons, let them hasten to our brethren
and peers, the bishops of the churches beyond the sea, and present to them in the first place a
complaint concerning the conduct and contumacy of the accused, as having through consciousness of
guilt declined the jurisdiction of their peers in Africa, so that by these foreign bishops they may
be summoned to compear and answer before them regarding the things laid to their charge. If they
disobey this summons, their criminality and obduracy will become known to those other bishops; and by
a synodical letter sent in their name to all parts of the world throughout which the Church of Christ
is nosy extended, the parties accused will be excluded from communion with all churches, in order to
prevent the springing up of error in the see of the Church at Carthage. When that has been done, and
these men have been separated from the whole Church, we shall without fear ordain another bishop over
the community in Carthage; whereas, if now another bishop be ordained by us, communion will most
probably be withheld from him by the Church beyond the sea, because they will not recognise the
validity of the deposition of the bishop, whose ordination was everywhere acknowledged, and with whom
letters of communion had been exchanged; and thus, through our undue eagerness to pronounce without
deliberation a final sentence, the great scandal of schism within the Church, when it has rest from
without, may arise, and we may be found presuming to set up another altar, not against Caecilianus,
but against the universal Church, which, uninformed of our procedure, would still hold communion with
him."</P>

<P>9. If any one had been disposed to reject sound and equitable counsels such as these, what could
he have done? or how could he have procured the condemnation of any one of his absent peers, when he
could not have any decisions with the authority of the Council, seeing that the Primate was opposed
to him? And if such a serious revolt against the authority of the Primate himself arose, that some
were resolved to condemn at once those whose case he desired to postpone, how much better would it
have been for him to separate himself by dissent from such quarrelsome and factious men, than from
the communion of the whole world! But because there were no charges which could be proved at the bar
of foreign bishops against Caecilianus and those who took part in his ordination, those who condemned
them were not willing to delay passing sentence; and when they had pronounced it, were not at any
pains to intimate to the Church beyond the sea the names of those in Africa with whom, as condemned
traditors, she should avoid communion. For if they had attempted this, Caecilianus and the others
would have defended themselves, and would have vindicated their innocence against their false
accusers by a most thorough trial before the ecclesiastical tribunal of bishops beyond the sea.</P>

<P>10. Our belief concerning that perverse and unjust Council is, that it was composed chiefly of
traditors whom Secundus of Tigisis had pardoned on their confession of guilt; and who, when a rumour
had gone abroad that some had been guilty of delivering up the sacred books, sought to turn aside
suspicion from themselves by bringing a calumny upon others, and to escape the detection of their
crime, through surrounding themselves with a cloud of lying rumours, when men throughout all Africa,
believing their bishops, said what was false concerning innocent men, that they had been condemned at
Carthage as traditors. Whence you perceive, my beloved friends, how that which some of your party
affirmed to be improbable could indeed happen, viz. that the very men who had confessed their own
guilt as traditors, and had obtained the remission of their case to the divine tribunal, afterwards
took part in judging and condemning others who, not being present to defend themselves, were accused
of the same crime. For their own guilt made them more eagerly embrace an opportunity by which they
might overwhelm others with a groundless accusation, and by thus finding occupation for the tongues
of men, which screen their own misdeeds from investigation. Moreover, if it were inconceivable that a
man should condemn in another the wrong which he had himself done, the Apostle Paul would not have
had occasion to say: "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for
wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same
things."<SUP><A HREF="#P3296_1314739">197</A></SUP> This is exactly what these men
did, so that the words of the apostle may be fully and appropriately applied to them.</P>

<P>11. Secundus, therefore, was not acting in the interests of peace and unity when he remitted to
the divine tribunal the crimes which these men confessed: for, if so, he would have been much more
careful to prevent a schism at Carthage, when there were none present to whom he might be constrained
to grant pardon of a crime which they confessed; when, on the contrary, all that the preservation of
peace demanded was a refusal to condemn those who were absent. They would have acted unjustly to
these innocent men, had they even resolved to <I>pardon</I> them, when they were not proved guilty,
and had not confessed the guilt, but were actually not present at all. For the guilt of a man is
established beyond question when he accepts a pardon. How much more outrageous and blind were they
who thought that they had power to condemn for crimes which, as unknown, they could not even have
forgiven! In the former case, crimes that were known were remitted to the divine arbitration, lest
others should be inquired into; in the latter case, crimes that were not known were made ground of
condemnation, that those which were known might be concealed. But it will be said, the crime of
Caecilianus and the others was known. Even if I were to admit this, the fact of their absence ought
to have protected them from such a sentence. For they were not chargeable with deserting a tribunal
before which they had never stood; nor was the Church so exclusively represented in these African
bishops, that in refusing to appear before them they could be supposed to decline all ecclesiastical
jurisdiction. For there remained thousands of bishops in countries beyond the sea, before whom it was
manifest that those who seemed to distrust their peers in Africa and Numidia could be tried. Have you
forgotten what Scripture commands: "Blame no one before you have examined him; and when you have
examined him, let your correction be just"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3298_1316794">198</A></SUP> If, then, the Holy Spirit has forbidden us to
blame or correct any one before we have questioned him, how much greater is the crime of not merely
blaming or correcting, but actually condemning men who, being absent, could not be examined as to the
charges brought against them!</P>

<P>12. Moreover, as to the assertion of these judges, that though the parties accused were absent,
having not fled from trial, but always avowed their distrust of that faction, and declined to appear
before them, the crimes for which they condemned them were well known; I ask, my brethren, how did
they know them? You reply, We cannot tell, since the evidence is not stated in the public Acts. But I
will tell you how they knew them. Observe carefully the case of Felix of Aptunga, and first read how
much more vehement they were against him; for they had just the same grounds for their knowledge in
the case of the others as in his, who was afterwards proved most completely innocent by a thorough
and severe investigation. How much greater the justice and safety and readiness with which we are
warranted in believing the innocence of the others whose indictment was less serious, and their
condemnation less severe, seeing that the man against whom they raged much more furiously has been
proved innocent!</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>13. Some one may perhaps make an objection which, though it was disapproved by you when it was
brought forward, I must not pass over, for it has been made by others, viz.: It was not meet that a
bishop should be acquitted by trial before a proconsul: as if the bishop had himself procured this
trial, and it had not been done by order of the Emperor, to whose care this matter, as one concerning
which he was responsible to God, especially belonged. For they themselves had constituted the Emperor
the arbiter and judge in this question regarding the surrender of the sacred books, and regarding the
schism, by their sending petitions to him, and afterwards appealing to him; and nevertheless they
refuse to acquiesce in his decision. If, therefore, he is to be blamed whom the magistrate absolved,
though he had not himself applied to that tribunal, how much more worthy of blame are those who
desired an earthly king to be the judge of their cause! For if it be not wrong to appeal to the
Emperor, it is not wrong to be tried by the Emperor, and consequently not wrong to be tried by him to
whom the Emperor refers the case. One of your friends was anxious to make out a ground of complaint
on the fact that, in the case of the bishop Felix, one witness was suspended on the rack, and another
tortured with pincers.<SUP><A HREF="#P3302_1319428">199</A></SUP> But was it in the
power of Felix to prevent the prosecution of the inquiry with diligence, and even severity, when the
case regarding which the advocate was labouring to discover the truth was his own? For what else
would such a resistance to investigation have been construed to signify, than a confession of his
crime? And yet this proconsul, surrounded with the awe-inspiring voices of heralds, and the
blood-stained hands of executioners at his service, would not have condemned one of his peers in
absence, who declined to come before his tribunal, if there was any other place where his cause could
be disposed of. Or if he had in such circumstances pronounced sentence, he would himself assuredly
have suffered the due and just award prescribed by civil law.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>14. If, however, you repudiate the Acts of a proconsul, submit yourselves to the Acts of the
Church. These have all been read over to you in their order. Perhaps you will say that Melchiades,
bishop of the Roman Church, along with the other bishops beyond the sea who acted as his colleagues,
had no right to usurp the place of judge in a matter which had been already settled by seventy
African bishops, over whom the bishop of Tigisis as Primate presided. But what will you say if he in
fact did not usurp this place? For the Emperor, being appealed to, sent bishops to sit with him as
judges, with authority to decide the whole matter in the way which seemed to them just. This we
prove, both by the petitions of the Donatists and the words of the Emperor himself, both of which
were, as you remember, read to you, and are now accessible to be studied or transcribed by you. Read
and ponder all these. See with what scrupulous care for the preservation or restoration of peace and
unity everything was discussed; how the legal standing of the accusers was inquired into, and what
defects were proved in this matter against some of them; and how it was clearly proved by the
testimony of those present that they had nothing to say against Caecilianus, but wished to transfer
the whole matter to the people belonging to the party of Majorinus,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3305_1321606">200</A></SUP> that is, to the seditious multitude who were
opposed to the peace of the Church, in order, forsooth, that Caecilianus might be accused by that
crowd which they believed to be powerful enough to bend aside to their views the minds of the judges
by mere turbulent clamour, without any documentary evidence or examination as to the truth; unless it
was likely that true accusations should be brought against Caecilianus by a multitude infuriated and
infatuated by the cup of error and wickedness, in a place where seventy bishops had with insane
precipitancy condemned, in their absence, men who were their peers, and who were innocent, as was
proved in the case of Felix of Aptunga. They wished to have Caecilianus accused by a mob such as that
to which they had given way themselves, when they pronounced sentence upon parties who were absent,
and who had not been examined. But assuredly they had not come to judges who could be persuaded to
such madness.</P>

<P>15. Your own prudence may enable you to remark here both the obstinacy of these men, and the
wisdom of the judges, who to the last persisted in refusing to admit accusations against Caecilianus
from the populace who were of the faction of Majorinus, who had no legal standing in the case. You
will also remark how they were required to bring forward the men who had come with them from Africa
as accusers or witnesses, or in some other connection with the case, and how it was said that they
had been present, but had been withdrawn by Donatus. The said Donatus promised that he would produce
them, and this promise he made repeatedly; yet, after all, declined to appear again in presence of
that tribunal before which he had already confessed so much, that it seemed as if by his refusal to
return he desired only to avoid being present to hear himself condemned; but the things for which he
was to be condemned had been proved against him in his own presence, and after examination. Besides
this, a libel bringing charges against Caecilianus was handed in by some parties. How the inquiry was
thereupon opened anew, what persons brought up the libel, and how nothing after all could be proved
against Caecilianus, I need not state, seeing that you have heard it all, and can read it as often as
you please.</P>

<P>16. As to the fact that there were seventy bishops in the Council [which condemned Caecilianus],
you remember what was said in the way of pleading against him the venerable authority of so great a
number. Nevertheless these most venerable men resolved to keep their judgment unembarrassed by
endless questions of hopeless intricacy, and did not care to inquire either what was the number of
those bishops, or whence they had been collected, when they saw them to be blinded with such reckless
presumption as to pronounce rash sentence upon their peers in their absence, and without having
examined them. And yet what a decision was finally pronounced by the blessed Melchiades himself; how
equitable, how complete, how prudent, and how fitted to make peace! For he did not presume to depose
from his own rank those peers against whom nothing had been proved; and, laying blame chiefly upon
Donatus, whom he had found the cause of the whole disturbance, he gave to all the others restoration
if they chose to accept it, and was prepared to send letters of communion even to those who were
known to have been ordained by Majorinus; so that wherever there were two bishops, through this
dissension doubling their number, he decided that the one who was prior in the date of ordination
should be confirmed in his see, and a new congregation found for the other. O excellent man! O son of
Christian peace, father of the Christian people! Compare now this handful, with that multitude of
bishops, not counting, but weighing them: on the one side you have moderation and circumspection; on
the other, I precipitancy and blindness. On the one side, clemency has not wronged justice, nor has
justice been at variance with clemency; on the other side, fear was hiding itself under passion, and
passion was goaded to excess by fear. In the one case, they assembled to clear the innocent from
false accusations by discovering where the guilt really lay; in the other, they had met to screen the
guilty from true accusations by bringing false charges against the innocent.</P>

<P>Chap. VI.</P>

<P>17. Could Caecilianus leave himself to be tried and judged by these men, when he had such others
before whom, if his case were argued, he could most easily prove his innocence? He could not have
left himself in their hands even had he been a stranger recently ordained over the Church at
Carthage, and consequently not aware of the power in perverting the minds of men, either worthless or
unwise, which was then possessed by a certain Lucilla, a very wealthy woman, whom he had offended
when he was a deacon, by rebuking her in the exercise of church discipline; for this evil influence
was also at work to bring about that iniquitous transaction. For in that Council, in which men absent
and innocent were condemned by persons who had confessed themselves to be traditors, there were a few
who wished, by defaming others, to hide their own crimes, that men, led astray by unfounded rumours,
might be turned aside from inquiring into the truth. The number of those who were especially
interested in this was not great, although the preponderating authority was on their side; because
they had with them Secundus himself, who, yielding to fear, had pardoned them. But the rest are said
to have been bribed and instigated specially against Caecilianus by the money of Lucilla. There are
Acts in the possession of Zenophilus, a man of consular rank, according to which one Nundinarius, a
deacon who had been (as we learn from the same Acts) deposed by Sylvanus, bishop of Cirta, having
failed in an attempt to recommend himself to that party by the letters of other bishops, in the heat
of passion revealed many secrets, and brought them forward in open court; amongst which we read this
on the record, that the rearing of rival altars in the Church of Carthage, the chief city of Africa,
was due to the bishops being bribed by the money of Lucilla. I am aware that I did not read these
Acts to you, but you remember that there was not time. Besides these influences, there was also some
bitterness arising from mortified pride, because they had not themselves ordained Caecilianus bishop
of Carthage.</P>

<P>18. When Caecilianus knew that these men had assembled, not as impartial judges, but hostile and
perverted through all these things, was it possible that either he should consent, or the people over
whom he presided should allow him, to leave the church and go into a private dwelling, where he was
not to be tried fairly by his peers, but to be slain by a small faction, urged on by a woman's spite,
especially when he saw that his case might have an unbiassed and equitable hearing before the Church
beyond the sea, which was uninfluenced by private enmities on either side in the dispute? If his
adversaries declined pleading before that tribunal, they would thereby cut themselves off from that
communion with the whole world which innocence enjoys. And if they attempted there to bring a charge
against him, then he would compear for himself, and defend his innocence against all their plots, as
you have learned that he afterwards did, when they, already guilty of schism, and stained with the
atrocious crime of having actually reared their rival altar, applied-but too late-for the decision of
the Church beyond the sea. For this they would have done at first, if their cause had been supported
by truth; but their policy was to come to the trial after false rumours had gained strength by lapse
of time, and public report of old standing, so to speak, had prejudged the case; or, which seems more
likely, having first condemned Caecilianus as they pleased, they relied for safety upon their number,
and did not dare to open the discussion of so bad a case before other judges, by whom, as they were
not influenced by bribery, the truth might be discovered.</P>

<P>Chap. VII.</P>

<P>19. But when they actually found that the communion of the whole world with Caecilianus continued
as before, and that letters of communion from churches beyond the sea were sent to him, and not to
the man whom they had flagitiously ordained, they became ashamed of being always silent; for it might
be objected to them: Why did they suffer the Church in so many countries to go on in ignorance,
communicating with men that were condemned; and especially why did they cut themselves off from
communion with the whole world, against which they had no charge to make, by their bearing in silence
the exclusion from that communion of the bishop whom they had ordained in Carthage? They chose,
therefore, as it is reported, to bring their dispute with Caecilianus before the foreign churches, in
order to secure one of two things, either of which they were prepared to accept: if, on the one hand,
by any amount of craft, they succeeded in making good the false accusation, they would abundantly
satisfy their lust of revenge; if, however, they failed, they might remain as stubborn as before, but
would now have, as it were, some excuse for it, in alleging that they had suffered at the hands of an
unjust tribunal,-the common outcry of all worthless litigants, though they have been defeated by the
clearest light of truth,-as if it might not have been said, and most justly said, to them: "Well, let
us suppose that those bishops who decided the case at Rome were not good judges; there still remained
a plenary Council of the universal Church, in which these judges themselves might be put on their
defence; so that, if they were convicted of mistake, their decisions might be reversed." Whether they
have done this or not, let them prove: for we easily prove that it was not done, by the fact that the
whole world does not communicate with them; or if it was done, they were defeated there also, of
which their state of separation from the Church is a proof.</P>

<P>20. What they actually did afterwards, however, is sufficiently shown in the letter of the
Emperor. For it was not before other bishops, but at the bar of the Emperor, that they dared to bring
the charge of wrong judgment against ecclesiastical judges of so high authority as the bishops by
whose sentence the innocence of Caecilianus and their own guilt had been declared. He granted them
the second trial at Aries, before other bishops; not because this was due to them, but only as a
concession to their stubbornness, and from a desire by all means to restrain so great effrontery. For
this Christian Emperor did not presume so to grant their unruly and groundless complaints as to make
himself the judge of the decision pronounced by the bishops who had sat at Rome; but he appointed, as
I have said, other bishops, from whom, however, they preferred again to appeal to the Emperor
himself; and you have heard the terms in which he disapproved of this. Would that even then they had
desisted from their most insane contentions, and had yielded at last to the truth, as he yielded to
them when (intending afterwards to apologize for this course to the reverend prelates) he consented
to try their case after the bishops, on condition that, if they did not submit to his decision, for
which they had themselves appealed, they should thenceforward be silent! For he ordered that both
parties should meet him at Rome to argue the case. When Caecilianus, for some reason, failed to
compear there, he, at their request, ordered all to fob low him to Milan. Then some of their party
began to withdraw, perhaps offended that Constantine did not follow their example, and condemn
Caecilianus in his absence at once and summarily. When the prudent Emperor was aware of this, he
compelled the rest to come to Milan in charge of his guards. Caecilianus having come thither, he
brought him forward in person, as he has written; and having examined the matter with the diligence,
caution, and prudence which his letters on the subject indicate, he pronounced Caecilianus perfectly
innocent, and them most criminal.</P>

<P>Chap. VIII.</P>

<P>21. And to this day they administer baptism outside of the communion of the Church, and, if they
can, they rebaptize the members of the Church: they offer sacrifice in discord and schism, and salute
in the name of peace communities which they pronounce beyond the bounds of the peace of salvation.
The unity of Christ is rent asunder, the heritage of Christ is reproached, the baptism of Christ is
treated with contempt; and they refuse to have these errors corrected by constituted human
authorities, applying penalties of a temporal kind in order to prevent them from being doomed to
eternal punishment for such sacrilege. We blame them for the rage which has driven them to schism,
the madness which makes them rebaptize, and for the sin of separation from the heritage of Christ,
which has been spread abroad through all lands. In using manuscripts which are in their hands as well
as in ours, we mention churches, the names of which are now read by them also, but with which they
have now no communion; and when these are pronounced in their conventicles, they say to the reader,
"Peace be with thee;" and yet they have no peace with those to whom these letters were written. They,
on the other hand, blame us for crimes of men now dead, making charges which either are false, or, if
true, do not concern us; not perceiving that in the things which we lay to their charge they are all
involved, but in the things which they lay to our charge the blame is due to the chaff or the tares
in the Lord's harvest, and the crime does not belong to the good grain; not considering, moreover,
that within our unity those only have fellowship with the wicked who take pleasure in, their being
such, whereas those who are displeased; with their wickedness yet cannot correct them,-as they do not
presume to root out the tares before the harvest, lest they root out the wheat also,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3316_1335736">201</A></SUP> -have fellowship with them, not in their deeds,
but in the altar of Christ; so that not only do they avoid being defiled by them, but they deserve
commendation and praise according to the word of God, because, in order to prevent the name of Christ
from being reproached by odious schisms, they tolerate in the interest of unity that which in the
interest of righteousness they hate.</P>

<P>22. If they have ears, let them hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. For in the Apocalypse
of John we read: "Unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write: These things saith He that holdeth
the seven stars in His right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; I know
thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and
thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and hast
borne, and hast patience, and for My name's sake hast tolerated them,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3318_1336707">202</A></SUP> and hast not fainted."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3319_1336872">203</A></SUP> Now, if He wished this to be understood as
addressed to a celestial angel, and not to those invested with authority in the Church, He would not
go on to say: "Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will
come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3320_1337329">204</A></SUP> This could not be said to the heavenly angels,
who retain their love unchanged, as the only beings of their order that have departed and fallen from
their love are the devil and his angels. The first love here alluded to is that which was proved in
their tolerating for Christ's name's sake the false apostles. To this He commands them to return, and
to do "their first works." Now we are reproached with the crimes of bad men, not done by us, but by
others; and some of them, moreover, not known to us. Nevertheless, even if they were actually
committed, and that under our own eyes, and we bore with them for the sake of unity, letting the
tares alone on account of the wheat, whosoever with open heart receives the Holy Scriptures would
pronounce us not only free from blame, but worthy of no small praise.</P>

<P>23. Aaron bears with the multitude demanding, fashioning, and worshipping an idol. Moses bears
with thousands murmuring against God, and so often offending His holy name. David bears with Saul his
persecutor, even when forsaking the things that are above by his wicked life, and following after the
things that are beneath by magical arts, avenges his death, and calls him the Lord's anointed,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3322_1338555">205</A></SUP> because of the venerable right by which he had
been consecrated. Samuel bears with the reprobate sons of Eli, and his own perverse sons, whom the
people refused to tolerate, and were therefore rebuked by the warning and punished by the severity of
God. Lastly, he bears with the nation itself, though proud and despising God. Isaiah bears with those
against whom he hurls so many merited denunciations. Jeremiah bears with those at whose hands he
suffers so many things. Zechariah bears with the scribes and Pharisees, as to whose character in
those days Scripture informs us. I know that I have omitted many examples: let those who are willing
and able read the divine records for themselves: they will find that all the holy servants and
friends of God have always had to bear with some among their own people, with whom, nevertheless,
they partook in the sacraments of that dispensation, and in so doing not only were not defiled by
them, but were to be commended for their tolerant spirit, "endeavouring to keep," as the apostle
says, "the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3323_1339667">206</A></SUP> Let them also observe what has occurred since
the Lord's coming, in which time we would find many more examples of this toleration in all parts of
the world, if they could all be written down and authenticated: but attend to those which are on
record. The Lord Himself bears with Judas, a devil, a thief, His own betrayer; He permits him, along
with the innocent disciples, to receive that which believers know as our ransom.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3324_1340112">207</A></SUP> The apostles bear with false apostles; and in
the midst of men who sought their own things, and not the things of Jesus Christ, Paul, not seeking
his own, but the things of Christ, lives in the practice of a most noble toleration. In fine, as I
mentioned a little while ago, the person presiding under the title of Angel over a Church, is
commended, because, though he hated those that were evil, he yet bore with them for the Lord's name's
sake, even when they were tried and discovered.</P>

<P>24. In conclusion, let them ask themselves: Do they not bear with the murders and devastations by
fire which are perpetrated by the Circumcelliones, who treat with honour the dead bodies of those who
cast themselves down from dangerous heights? Do they not bear with the misery which has made all
Africa groan for years beneath the incredible outrages of one man, Optatus [bishop of Thamugada]? I
forbear from specifying the tyrannical acts of violence and public depredations in districts, towns,
and properties throughout Africa; for it is better to leave you to speak of these to each other,
whether in whispers or openly, as you please. For wherever you turn your eyes, you will find the
things of which I speak, or, more correctly, refrain from speaking. Nor do we on this ground accuse
those whom, when they do such things, you love. What we dislike in that party is not their bearing
with those who are wicked, but their intolerable wickedness in the matter of schism, of raising altar
against altar, and of separation from the heritage of Christ now spread, as was so long ago promised,
throughout the world. We behold with grief and lamentation peace broken, unity rent asunder, baptism
administered a second time, and contempt poured on the sacraments, which are holy even when
ministered and received by the wicked. If they regard these things as trifles, let them observe those
examples by which it has been proved how they are esteemed by God. The men who made an idol perished
by a common death, being slain with the sword:<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3326_1342258">208</A></SUP> but when the men endeavoured to make a schism in
Israel, the leaders were swallowed up by the opening earth, and the crowd of their accomplices was
consumed by fire.<SUP><A HREF="#P3327_1342450">209</A></SUP> In the difference
between the punishments, the different degrees of demerit may be discerned.</P>

<P>Chap. IX.</P>

<P>25. These, then, are the facts: In time of persecution, the sacred books are surrendered to the
persecutors. Those who were guilty of this surrender confess it, and are remitted to the divine
tribunal; those who were innocent are not examined, but condemned at once by rash men. The integrity
of that one who, of all the men thus condemned in their absence, was the most vehemently accused, is
afterwards vindicated before unimpeachable judges. From the decision of bishops an appeal is made to
the Emperor; the Emperor is chosen judge; and the sentence of the Emperor, when pronounced, is set at
naught. What was then done you have read; what is now being done you have before your eyes. If, after
all that you have read, you are still in doubt, be convinced by what you see. By all means let us
give up arguing from ancient manuscripts, public archives, or the acts of courts, civil or
ecclesiastical. We have a greater book-the world itself. In it I read the accomplishment of that of
which I read the promise in the Book of God: "The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day
have I begotten Thee: ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3330_1343813">210</A></SUP> He that has not communion with this inheritance
may know himself to be disinherited, whatever books he may plead to the contrary. He that assails
this inheritance is plainly enough declared to be an outcast from the family of God. The question is
raised as to the parties guilty of surrendering the divine books in which that inheritance is
promised. Let him be believed to have delivered the testament to the flames, who is resisting the
intentions of the testator. O faction of Donatus, what has the Corinthian Church done against you? In
speaking of this one Church, I wish to be understood as asking the same question in regard to all
similar churches remote from you. What have these churches done against you, which could not know
even what you had done, or the names of the men whom you branded with condemnation? Or is it so, that
because Caecilianus gave offence to Lucilla in Africa, the light of Christ is lost to the whole
world?<SUP><A HREF="#P3331_1344774">211</A></SUP> </P>

<P>26. Let them at last become sensible of what they have done; for in the lapse of years, by a just
retribution, their work has recoiled upon themselves. Ask by what woman's instigation
Maximianus<SUP><A HREF="#P3333_1345034">212</A></SUP> (said to be a kinsman of
Donatus) withdrew himself from the communion of Primianus, and how, having gathered a faction of
bishops, he pronounced sentence against Primianus in his absence, and had himself ordained as a rival
bishop in his place,-precisely as Majorinus, under the influence of Lucilla, assembled a faction of
bishops, and, having condemned Caecilianus in his absence, was ordained bishop in opposition to him.
Do you admit, as I suppose you do, that when Primianus was delivered by the other bishops of his
communion in Africa from the sentence pronounced by the faction of Maximianus, this decision was
valid and sufficient? And will you refuse to admit the same in the case of Caecilianus, when he was
released by the bishops of the same one Church beyond the sea from the sentence pronounced by the
faction of Majorinus? Pray, my brethren, what great thing do I ask of you? What difficulty is there
in comprehending what I bring before you? The African Church, if it be compared with the churches in
other parts of the world, is very different from them, and is left far behind both in numbers and in
influence; and even if it had retained its unity, is far smaller when compared with the universal
Church in other nations, than was the faction of Maximianus when compared with that of Primianus. I
ask, however, only this-and I believe it to be just-that you give no more weight to the Council of
Secundus of Tigisis, which Lucilla stirred up against Caecilianus when absent, and against an
apostolic see and the whole world in communion with Caecilianus, than you give to the Council of
Maximianus, which in like manner some other woman stirred up against Primianus when absent, and
against the rest of the multitude throughout Africa which was in communion with him. What case could
be more transparent? what demand more just?</P>

<P>27. You see and know all these things, and you groan over them; and yet God at the same time sees
that nothing compels you to remain in such fatal and impious schism, if you would but subdue the lust
of the flesh in order to win the spiritual kingdom; and in order to escape from eternal punishment,
have courage to forfeit the friendship of men, whose favour will not avail at the bar of God. Go now,
and take counsel together: find what you can say in reply to that which I have written. If you bring
forward manuscripts on your side, we do the same; if your party say that our documents are not to be
trusted, let them not take it amiss if we retort the charge. No one can erase from heaven the divine
decree, no one can efface from earth the Church of God. His decree has promised the whole world, and
the Church has filled it; and it includes both bad and good. On earth it loses none but the bad, arid
into heaven it admits none but the good.</P>

<P>In writing this discourse, God is my witness with what sincere love to peace and to you I have
taken and used that which He has given. It shall be to you a means of correction if you be willing,
and a testimony against you whether you will or not.</P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. In passing through Tubursi on my way to the church at Cirta, though pressed for time, I visited
Fortunius, your bishop there, and found him to be, in truth, just such a man as you were wont most
kindly to lead me to expect. When I sent him notice of your conversation with me concerning him, and
expressed a desire to see him, he did not decline the visit. I therefore went to him, because I
thought it due to his age that I should go to him, instead of insisting upon his first coming to me.
I went, therefore, accompanied by a considerable number of persons, who, as it happened, were at that
time beside me. When, however, we had taken our seats in his house, the thing becoming known, a
considerable addition was made to the crowd assembled; but in that whole multitude there appeared to
me to be very few who desired the matter to be discussed in a sound and profitable manner, or with
the deliberation and solemnity which so great a question demands. All the others had come rather in
the mood of playgoers, expecting a scene in our debates, than in Christian seriousness of spirit,
seeking instruction in regard to salvation. Accordingly they could neither favour us with silence
when we spoke, nor speak with care, or even with due regard to decorum and order,-excepting, as I
have said, those few persons about whose pious and sincere interest in the matter there was no doubt.
Everything was therefore thrown into confusion by the noise of men speaking loudly, and each
according to the unchecked impulse of his own feelings; and though both Fortunius and I used entreaty
and remonstrance, we utterly failed in persuading them to listen silently to what was spoken.</P>

<P>2. The discussion of the question was opened notwithstanding, and for some hours we persevered,
speeches being delivered by each side in turn, so far as was permitted by an occasional respite from
the voices of the noisy onlookers. In the beginning of the debate, perceiving that things which had
been spoken were liable to be forgotten by myself, or by those about whose salvation I was deeply
concerned; being desirous also that our debate should be managed with caution and self-restraint, and
that both you and other brethren who were absent might be able to learn from a record what passed in
the discussion, I demanded that our words should be taken down by reporters. This was for a long time
resisted, either by Fortunius or by those on his side. At length, however, he agreed to it; but the
reporters who were present, and were able to do the work thoroughly, declined, for some reason
unknown to me, to take notes. I urged them, that at least the brethren who accompanied me, though not
so expert in the work, should take notes, and promised that I would leave the tablets on which the
notes were taken in the hands of the other party. This was agreed to. Some words of mine were first
taken down, and some statements on the other side were dictated and recorded. After that, the
reporters, not being able to endure the disorderly interruptions vociferated by the opposing party,
and the increased vehemence with which under this pressure our side maintained the debate, gave up
their task. This, however, did not close the discussion, many things being still said by each as he
obtained an opportunity. This discussion of the whole question, or at least so much of all that was
said as I can remember, I have resolved, my beloved friends, that you shall not lose; and you may
read this letter to Fortunius, that he may either confirm my statements as true, or himself inform
you, without hesitation, of anything which his more accurate recollection suggests.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. He was pleased to begin with commending my manner of life, which he said he had come to know
through your statements (in which I am sure there was more kindness than truth), adding that he had
remarked to you that I might have done well all the things which you had told him of me, if I had
done them within the Church. I thereupon asked him what was the Church within which it was the duty
of a man so to live; whether it was that one which, as Sacred Scripture had long foretold, was spread
over the whole world, or that one which a small section of Africans, or a small part of Africa,
contained. To this he at first attempted to reply, that his communion was in all parts of the earth.
I asked him whether he was able to issue letters of communion, which we call regular,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3345_1352805">213</A></SUP> to places which I might select; and I affirmed,
what was obvious to all, that in this way the question might be most simply settled. In the event of
his agreeing to this, my intention was that we should send such letters to those churches which we
both knew, on the authority of the apostles, to have been already rounded in their time.</P>

<P>4. As the falsity of his statement, however, was apparent, a hasty retreat from it was made in a
cloud of confused words, in the midst of which he quoted the Lord's words: "Beware of false prophets,
which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by
their fruits."<SUP><A HREF="#P3347_1353473">214</A></SUP> When I said that these
words of the Lord might also be applied by us to them, he went on to magnify the persecution which he
affirmed that his party had often suffered; intending thereby to prove that his party were Christians
because they endured persecution. When I was preparing, as he went on with this, to answer him from
the Gospel, he himself anticipated me in bringing forward the passage in which the Lord says:
"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven."<SUP><A HREF="#P3348_1354023">215</A></SUP> Thanking him for the apt
quotation, I immediately added that this behoved therefore to be inquired into, whether they had
indeed suffered persecution for righteousness' sake. In following up this inquiry I wished this to be
ascertained, though indeed it was patent to all, whether the persecutions under Macarius<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3349_1354357">216</A></SUP> fell upon them while they were within the unity
of the Church, or after they had been severed from it by schism; so that those who wished to see
whether they had suffered persecution for righteousness' sake might turn rather to the prior
question, whether they had done rightly in cutting themselves off from the unity of the whole world.
For if they were found in this to have done wrong, it was manifest that they suffered persecution for
unrighteousness' sake rather than for righteousness' sake, and could not therefore be numbered among
those of whom it is said, "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake." Thereupon
mention was made of the surrender of the sacred books, a matter about which much more has been spoken
than has ever been proved true. On our side it was said in reply, that their leaders rather than ours
had been traditors; but that if they would not believe the documents with which we supported this
charge, we could not be compelled to accept those which they brought forward. </P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>5. Having therefore laid aside that question as one on which there was a doubt, I asked how they
could justify their separation of themselves from all other Christians who had done them no wrong,
who throughout the world preserved the order of succession, and were established in the most ancient
churches, but had no knowledge whatever as to who were traditors in Africa; and who assuredly could
not hold communion with others than those whom they had heard. of as occupying the episcopal sees. He
answered that the foreign churches had done them no wrong, up to the time when they had consented to
the death of those who, as he had said, had suffered in the Macarian persecution. Here I might have
said that it was impossible for the innocence of the foreign churches to be affected by the offence
given in the time of Macarius, seeing that it could not be proved that he had done with their
sanction what he did. I preferred, however, to save time by asking whether, supposing that the
foreign churches had, through the cruelties of Macarius, lost their innocence from the time in which
they were said to have approved of these, it could even be proved that up to that time the Donatists
had remained in unity with the Eastern churches and other parts of the world.</P>

<P>6. Thereupon he produced a certain volume, by which he wished to show that a Council at Sardica
had sent a letter to African bishops who belonged to the party of Donatus. When this was read aloud,
I heard the name Donatus among the bishops to whom the writing had been sent. I therefore insisted
upon being told whether this was the Donatus from whom their faction takes its name; as it was
possible that they had written to some bishop named Donatus belonging to another section [heresy],
especially since in these names no mention had been made of Africa. How then, I asked, could it be
proved that we must believe the Donatus here named to be the Donatist bishop, when it could not even
be proved that this letter had been specially directed to bishops in Africa? For although Donatus is
a common African name, there is nothing improbable in the supposition, that either some one in other
countries should be found bearing an African name, or that a native of Africa should be made a bishop
there. We found, moreover, no day or name of consul given in the letter, from which any certain light
might have been furnished by comparison of dates. I had indeed once heard that the Arians, when they
had separated from the Catholic communion, had endeavoured to ally the Donatists in Africa with
themselves; and my brother Alypius recalled this to me at the time in a whisper. Having then taken up
the volume itself, and glancing over the decrees of the said Council, I read that Athanasius,
Catholic bishop of Alexandria, who was so conspicuous as a debater in the keen controversies with the
Arians, and Julius, bishop of the Roman Church, also a Catholic, had been condemned by that Council
of Sardica; from which we were sure that it was a Council of Arians, against which heretics these
Catholic bishops had contended with singular fervour. therefore wished to take up and carry with me
the volume, in order to give more pains to find out the date of the Council. He refused it, however,
saying that I could get it there if I wished to study anything in it. I asked also that he would
allow me to mark the volume; for I feared, I confess, lest, if perchance necessity arose for my
asking to consult it, another should be substituted in its room. This also he refused.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>7. Thereafter he began to insist upon my answering categorically this question: Whether I thought
the persecutor or the persecuted to be in the right? To which I answered, that the question was not
fairly sated: it might be that both were in the wrong, or that the persecution might be made by the
one who was the more righteous of the two parties; and therefore it was not always right to infer
that one is on the better side because he suffers persecution, although that is almost always the
case. When I perceived that he still laid great stress upon this, wishing to have the justice of the
cause of his party acknowledged as beyond dispute because they had suffered persecution, I asked
him.whether he believed Ambrose, bishop of the Church of Milan, to be a righteous man and a
Christian? He was compelled to deny expressly that that man was a Christian and a righteous man; for
if he had admitted this, I would at once have objected to him that he esteemed it necessary for him
to be rebaptized. When, therefore, he was compelled to pronounce concerning Ambrose that he was not a
Christian nor a righteous man, I related the persecution which he endured when his church was
surrounded with soldiers. I also asked whether Maximianus, who had made a schism from their party at
Carthage, was in his view a righteous man and a Christian. He could not but deny this. I therefore
reminded him that he had endured such persecution that his church had been razed to the foundations.
By these instances I laboured to persuade him, if possible, to give up affirming that the suffering
of persecution is the most infallible mark of Christian righteousness.</P>

<P>8. He also related that, in the infancy of their schism, his predecessors, being anxious to devise
some way of hushing up the fault of Caecilianus, lest a schism should take place, had appointed over
the people belonging to his communion in Carthage an interim bishop before Majorinus was ordained in
opposition to Caecilianus. He alleged that this interim bishop was murdered in his own meeting house
by our party. This, I confess, I had never heard before, though so many charges brought by them
against us have been refuted and disproved, while by us greater and more numerous crimes have been
alleged against them. After having narrated this story, he began again to insist on my answering
whether in this case I thought the murderer or the victim the more righteous man; as if he had
already proved that the event had taken place as he had stated. I therefore said that we must first
ascertain the truth of the story, for we ought not to believe without examination all that is said:
and that even were it true, it was possible either that both were equally bad, or that one who was
bad had caused the death of another yet worse than himself. For, in truth, it is possible that his
guilt is more heinous who rebaptizes the whole man than his who kills the body only.</P>

<P>9. After this there was no occasion for the question which he afterwards put to me. He affirmed
that even a bad man should not be killed by Christians and righteous men; as if we called those who
in the Catholic Church do such things righteous men: a statement, moreover, which it is more easy for
them to affirm than to prove to us, so long as they themselves, with few exceptions, bishops,
presbyters, and clergy of all kinds, go on gathering mobs of most infatuated men, and causing,
wherever they are able, so many violent massacres, and devastations to the injury not of Catholics
only, but sometimes even of their own partisans. In spite of these facts, Fortunius, affecting
ignorance of the most villanous doings, which were better known by him than by me, insisted upon my
giving an example of a righteous man putting even a bad man to death. This was, of course, not
relevant to the matter in hand; for I conceded that wherever such crimes were committed by men having
the name of Christians, they were not the actions of good men. Nevertheless, in order to show him
what was the true question before us, I answered by inquiring whether Elijah seemed to him to be a
righteous man; to which he could not but assent. Thereupon I reminded him how many false prophets
Elijah slew with his own hand.<SUP><A HREF="#P3357_1363563">217</A></SUP> He saw
plainly herein, as indeed he could not but see, that such things were then lawful to righteous men.
For they did these things as prophets guided by the Spirit and sanctioned by the authority of God,
who knows infallibly to whom it may be even a benefit to be put to death.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3358_1363869">218</A></SUP> He therefore required me to show him one who,
being a righteous man, had in the New Testament times put any one, even a criminal and impious man,
to death.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>10. I then returned to the argument used in my former letter,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3361_1364137">219</A></SUP> in which I laboured to show that it was not
right either for us to reproach them with atrocities of which some of their party had been guilty, or
for them to reproach us if any such deeds were found by them to have been done on our side. For I
granted that no example could be produced from the New Testament of a righteous man putting any one
to death; but I insisted that by the example of our Lord Himself, it could be proved that the wicked
had been tolerated by the innocent. For His own betrayer, who had already received the price of His
blood, He suffered to remain undistinguished from the innocent who were with Him, even up to that
last kiss of peace. He did not conceal from the disciples the fact that in the midst of them was one
capable of such a crime; and, nevertheless, He administered to them all alike, without excluding the
traitor, the first sacrament of His body and blood.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3362_1365068">220</A></SUP> When almost all felt the force of this argument,
Fortunius attempted to meet it by saying, that before the Lord's Passion that communion with a wicked
man did no harm to the apostles, because they had not as yet the baptism of Christ, but the baptism
of John only. When he said this, I asked him to explain how it was written that Jesus baptized more
disciples than John, though Jesus Himself baptized not, but His disciples, that is to say, baptized
by means of His disciples?<SUP><A HREF="#P3363_1365573">221</A></SUP> How could they
give what they had not received (a question often used by the Donatists themselves)? Did Christ
baptize with the baptism of John? I was prepared to ask many other questions in connection with this
opinion of Fortunius; such as-how John himself was interrogated as to the Lord's baptizing, and
replied that He had the bride, and was the Bridegroom?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3364_1365959">222</A></SUP> Was it, then, lawful for the Bridegroom to
baptize with the baptism of him who was but a friend or servant? Again, how could they receive the
Eucharist if not previously baptized? or how could the Lord in that case have said in reply to Peter,
who was willing to be wholly washed by Him, "He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but
is clean every whit"?<SUP><A HREF="#P3365_1366349">223</A></SUP> For perfect
cleansing is by the baptism, not of John, but of the Lord, if the person receiving it be worthy; if,
however, he be unworthy, the sacraments abide in him, not to his salvation, but to his perdition.
When I was about to put these questions, Fortunius himself saw that he ought not to have mooted the
subject of the baptism of the disciples of the Lord.</P>

<P>11. From this we passed to something else, many on both sides discoursing to the best of their
ability. Among other things it was alleged that our party was still intending to persecute them; and
he [Fortunius] said that he would like to see how I would act in the event of such persecution,
whether I would consent to such cruelty, or withhold from it all countenance. I said that God saw my
heart, which was unseen by them; also that they had hitherto had no ground for apprehending such
persecution, which if it did take place would be the work of bad men, who were, however, not so bad
as some of their own party; but that it was not incumbent on us to withdraw ourselves from communion
with the Catholic Church on the ground of anything done against our will, and even in spite of our
opposition (if we had an opportunity of testifying against it), seeing that we had learned that
toleration for the sake of peace which the apostle prescribes in the words: "Forbearing one another
in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3367_1367798">224</A></SUP> I affirmed that they had not preserved this
peace and forbearance, when they had caused a schism, within which, moreover, the more moderate among
them now tolerated more serious evils, lest that which was already a fragment should be broken again,
although they did not, in order to preserve unity, consent to exercise forbearance in smaller things.
I also said that in the ancient economy the peace of unity and forbearance had not been so fully
declared and commended as it is now by the example of the Lord and the charity of the New Testament;
and yet prophets and holy men were wont to protest against the sins of the people, without
endeavouring to separate themselves from the unity of the Jewish people, and from communion in
partaking along with them of the sacraments then appointed.</P>

<P>12. After that, mention was made, I know not in what connection, of Genethlius of blessed memory,
the predecessor of Aurelius in the see of Carthage, because he had suppressed some edict granted
against the Donatists, and had not suffered it to be carried into effect. They were all praising and
commending him with the utmost kindness. I interrupted their commendatory speeches with the remark
that, for all this, if Genethlius himself had fallen into their hands, it would have been declared
necessary to baptize him a second time. (We were by this time all standing, as the time of our going
away was at hand.) On this the old man said plainly, that a rule had now been made, according to
which every believer who went over from us to them must be baptized; but he said this with the most
manifest reluctance and sincere regret. When he himself most frankly bewailed many of the evil deeds
of his party, making evident, as was further proved by the testimony of the whole community, how far
he was from sharing in such transactions, and told us what he was wont to say in mild expostulation
to those of his own party; when also I had quoted the words of Ezekiel-"As the soul of the father, so
also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth it shall die"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3369_1369880">225</A></SUP> -it which it is written that the son's fault is
not to be reckoned to his father, nor the father's fault reckoned to his son, it was agreed by all
that in such discussions the excesses of bad men ought not to be brought forward by either party
against the other. There remained, therefore, only the question as to schism. I therefore exhorted
him again and again that he should with tranquil and undisturbed mind join me in an effort to bring
to a satisfactory end, by diligent research, the examination of so important a matter. When he kindly
replied that I myself sought this with a single eye, but that others who were on my side were averse
to such examination of the truth, I left him with this promise, that I would bring to him more of my
colleagues, ten at least, who desire this question to be sifted with the same good-will and calmness
and pious care which I saw that he had discovered and now commended in myself. He gave me a similar
promise regarding a like number of his colleagues.</P>

<P>Chap. VI.</P>

<P>13. Wherefore I exhort you, and by the blood of the Lord implore you, to put him in mind of his
promise, and to insist urgently that what has been begun, and is now, as you see, nearly finished,
may be concluded. For, in my opinion, you will have difficulty in finding among your bishops another
whose judgment and feelings are so sound as we have seen that old man's to be. The next day he came
to me himself, and we began to discuss the matter again. I could not, however, remain long with him,
as the ordination of a bishop required my departing from the place. I had already sent a messenger to
the chief man of the Coelicolae,<SUP><A HREF="#P3372_1371542">226</A></SUP> of whom
I had heard that he had introduced a new baptism among them, and had by this impiety led many astray,
intending, so far as my limited time permitted, to confer with him. Fortunius, when he learned that
he was coming, perceiving that I was to be otherwise engaged, and having himself some other duty
calling him from home, bade me a kind and friendly farewell.</P>

<P>14. It seems to me that if we would avoid the attendance of a noisy crowd, rather hindering than
helping the debate, and if we wish to complete by the Lord's help so great a work begun in a spirit
of unfeigned good-will and peace, we ought to meet in some small village in which neither party has a
church, and which is inhabited by persons belonging to both churches, such as Titia. Let this or any
other such place be agreed upon in the region of Tubursi or of Thagaste, and let us take care to have
the canonical books at hand for reference. Let any other documents be brought thither which either
party may judge useful; and laying all other things aside, uninterrupted, if it please God, by other
cares, devoting our time for as many days as we can to this one work, and each imploring. in private
the Lord's guidance, we may, by the help of Him to whom Christian peace is most sweet, bring to a
happy termination the inquiry which has been in such a good spirit opened. Do not fail to write in
reply what you or Fortunius think of this.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Beloved and Venerable Father the Bishop Augustin, Publicola Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>It is written: "Ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell
thee."<SUP><A HREF="#P3383_1373501">227</A></SUP> I have therefore judged it right
to "seek the law at the mouth of the priest" in regard to a certain case which I shall state in this
letter, desiring at the same time to be instructed in regard to several other matters. I have
distinguished the several questions by stating each in a separate paragraph, and I beg you kindly to
give an answer to each in order.</P>

<P>I. In the country of the Arzuges it is customary, as I have heard, for the barbarians to take an
oath, swearing by their false gods, in the presence of the decurion stationed on the frontier or of
the tribune, when they have come under engagement to carry baggage to any part, or to protect the
crops from depredation; and when the decurion certifies in writing that this oath has been taken, the
owners or farmers of land employ them as watchmen of their crops; or travellers who have occasion to
pass through their country hire them, as if assured of their now being trustworthy. Now a doubt has
arisen in my mind whether the landowner who thus employs a barbarian, of whose fidelity he is
persuaded in consequence of such an oath, does not make himself and the crops committed to that man's
charge to share the defilement of that sinful oath; and so also with the traveller who may employ his
services. I should mention, however, that in both cases the barbarian is rewarded for his services
with money. Nevertheless in both transactions there comes in, besides the pecuniary remuneration,
this oath before the decurion or tribune involving mortal sin. I am concerned as to whether this sin
does not defile either him who accepts the oath of the barbarian, or at least the things which are
committed to the barbarian's keeping. For whatever other terms be in the arrangement, even such as
the payment of gold, and giving of hostages in security, nevertheless this sinful oath has been a
real part of the transaction. Be pleased to resolve my doubts definitely and positively. For if your
answer indicate that you are in doubt yourself, I may fall into greater perplexity than before.</P>

<P>II. I have also heard that my own land-stewards receive from the barbarians hired to protect the
crops an oath in which they appeal to their false gods. Does not this oath so defile these crops,
that if a Christian uses them or takes the money realized by their sale, he is himself defiled? Do
answer this.</P>

<P>III. Again, I have heard from one person that no oath was taken by the barbarian in making
agreement with my steward, but another has said to me that such an oath was taken. Suppose now that
the latter statement were false, tell me if I am bound to forbear from using these crops, or the
money obtained for them, merely because I have heard the statement made, according to the scriptural
rule: "If any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not, for his sake that
showed it."<SUP><A HREF="#P3387_1376378">228</A></SUP> Is this case parallel to the
case of meat offered to idols; and if it is, what am I to do with the crops, or with the price of
them?</P>

<P>IV. In this case ought I to examine both him who said that no oath was taken before my steward,
and the other who said that the oath was taken, and bring witnesses to prove which of the two spoke
truly, leaving the crops or their price untouched so long as there is uncertainty in the matter?</P>

<P>V. If the barbarian who swears this sinful oath were to require of the steward or of the tribune
stationed on the frontier, that he, being a Christian, should give him assurance of his faithfulness
to his part of the engagement about watching the crops, by the same oath which he himself has taken,
involving mortal sin, does the oath pollute only that Christian man? Does it not also pollute the
things regarding which he took the oath? Or if a pagan who has authority on the frontier thus give to
a barbarian this oath in token of acting faithfully to him, does he not involve in the defilement of
his own sin those in whose interest he swears? If I send a man to the Arzuges, is it lawful for him
to take from a barbarian that sinful oath? Is not the Christian who takes such an oath from him also
defiled by his sin?</P>

<P>VI. Is it lawful for a Christian to use wheat or beans from the threshing-floor, wine or oil from
the press, if, with his knowledge, some part of what has been taken thence was offered in sacrifice
to a false god?</P>

<P>VII. May a Christian use for any purpose wood which he knows to have been taken from one of their
idols' groves?</P>

<P>VIII. If a Christian buy in the market meat which has not been offered to idols, and have in his
mind conflicting doubts as to whether it has been offered to idols or not, but eventually adopt the
opinion that it was not, does he sin if he partake of this meat?</P>

<P>IX. If a man does an action good in itself, about which he has some misgivings as to whether it is
good or bad, can it be reckoned as a sin to him if he does it believing it to be good, although
formerly he may have thought it bad?</P>

<P>X. If any one has falsely said that some meat has been offered to idols, and afterwards confess
that it was a falsehood, and this confession is believed, may a Christian use the meat regarding
which he heard that statement, or sell it, and use the price obtained?</P>

<P>XI. If a Christian on a journey, overpowered by want, having fasted for one, two, or several days,
so that he can no longer endure the privation, should by chance, when in the last extremity of
hunger, and when he sees death close at hand, find food placed in an idol's temple, where there is no
man near him, and no other food to be found; whether should he die or partake of that food?</P>

<P>XII. If a Christian is on the point of being killed by a barbarian or a Roman, ought he to kill
the aggressor to save his own life? or ought he even, without killing the assailant, to drive him
back and fight with him, seeing it has been said, "Resist not evil"?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3397_1379374">229</A></SUP> </P>

<P>XIII. May a Christian put a wall for defence against an enemy round his property? and if some use
that wall as a place from which to fight and kill the enemy, is the Christian the cause of the
homicide?</P>

<P>XIV. May a Christian drink at a fountain or well into which anything from a sacrifice has been
cast? May he drink from a well found in a deserted temple? If there be in a temple where an idol is
worshipped a well or fountain which nothing has defiled, may he draw water thence, and drink of
it?</P>

<P>XV. May a Christian use baths<SUP><A HREF="#P3401_1379921">230</A></SUP> in
places in which sacrifice is offered to images? May he use baths which are used by pagans on a
feastday, either while they are there or after they have left?</P>

<P>XVI. May a Christian use the same sedanchair<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3403_1380156">231</A></SUP> as has been used by pagans coming down from
their idols on a feastday, if in that chair they have performed any part of their idolatrous service,
and the Christian is aware of this?</P>

<P>XVII. If a Christian, being the guest of another, has forborne from using meat set before him,
concerning which it was said to him that it had been offered in sacrifice, but afterwards by some
accident finds the same meat for sale and buys it, or has it presented to him at another man's table,
and then eat of it, without knowing that it is the same, is he guilty of sin?</P>

<P>XVIII. May a Christian buy and use vegetables or fruit which he knows to have been brought from
the garden of a temple or of the priests of an idol?That you may not be put to trouble in searching
the Scriptures concerning the oath of which I have spoken and the idols, I resolved to set before you
those texts which, by the Lord's help, I have found; but if you have found anything better or more to
the purpose in Scripture, be so good as let me know. For example, when Laban said to Jacob, "The God
of Abraham and the God of Nahor judge betwixt us,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3406_1381335">232</A></SUP> Scripture does not declare which god is meant.
Again, when Abimelech came to Isaac, and he and those who were with him sware to Isaac, we are not
told what kind of oath it was.<SUP><A HREF="#P3407_1381535">233</A></SUP> As to the
idols, Gideon was commanded by the Lord to make a whole burnt-offering of the bullock which he
killed.<SUP><A HREF="#P3408_1381671">234</A></SUP> And in the book of Joshua the son
of Nun, it is said of Jericho that all the silver, and gold, and brass should be brought into the
treasures of the Lord, and the things found in the accursed city were called sacred.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3409_1381910">235</A></SUP> Also we read in Deuteronomy:<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3410_1381961">236</A></SUP> "Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into
thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it."</P>

<P>May the Lord preserve thee. I salute thee. Pray for me. </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XLVII.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 398.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To the Honourable Publicola, My Much Beloved Son, Augustin Sends Greeting in the
Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Your perplexities have, since I learned them by your letter, become mine also, not because
all those things by which you tell me that you are disturbed, disturb my mind: but I have been much
perplexed, I confess, by the question how your perplexities were to be removed; especially since you
require me to give a conclusive answer, lest you should fall into greater doubts than you had before
you applied to me to have them resolved. For I see that I cannot give this, since, though I may write
things which appear to me most certain, if I do not convince you, you must be beyond question more at
a loss than before; and though it is in my power to use arguments which weigh with myself, I may fail
of convincing another by these. However, lest I should refuse the small service which your love
claims, I have resolved after some consideration to write in reply.</P>

<P>2. One of your doubts is as to using the services of a man who has guaranteed his fidelity by
swearing by his false gods. In this matter I beg you to consider whether, in the event of a man
failing to keep his word after having pledged himself by such an oath, you would not regard him as
guilty of a twofold sin. For if he kept the engagement which he had confirmed by this oath, he would
be pronounced guilty in this only, that he swore by such deities; but no one would justly blame him
for keeping his engagement. But in the case supposed, seeing that he both swore by those whom he
should not worship, and did, notwithstanding his promise, what he should not have done, he was guilty
of two sins: whence it is obvious that in using, not for an evil work, but for some good and lawful
end, the service of a man whose fidelity is known to have been confirmed by an oath in the name of
false gods, one participates, not in the sin of swearing by the false gods, but in the good faith
with which he keeps his promise. The faith which I here speak of as kept is not that on account of
which those who are baptized in Christ are called faithful: that is entirely different and far
removed from the faith desiderated in regard to the arrangements and compacts of men. Nevertheless it
is, beyond all doubt, worse to swear falsely by the true God than to swear truly by the false gods;
for the greater the holiness of that by which we swear, the greater is the sin of perjury. It is
therefore a different question whether he is not guilty who requires another to pledge himself by
taking an oath in the name of his gods, seeing that he worships false gods. In answering this
question, we may accept as decisive those examples which you yourself quoted of Laban and of
Abimelech (if Abimelech did swear by his gods, as Laban swore by the god of Nahor). This is, as I
have said, another question, and one which would perchance perplex me, were it not for those examples
of Isaac and Jacob, to which, for aught I know, others might be added. It may be that some scruple
might yet be suggested by the precept in the New Testament, "Swear not at all;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3418_1385254">237</A></SUP> words which were in my opinion spoken, not
because it is a sin to swear a true oath, but because it is a heinous sin to forswear oneself: from
which crime our Lord would have us keep at a great distance, when He charged us not to swear at all.
I know, however, that our opinion is different: wherefore it should not be discussed at present; let
us rather treat of that about which you have thought of asking my advice. On the same ground on which
you forbear from swearing yourself, you may, if such be your opinion, regard it as forbidden to exact
an oath from another, although it is expressly said, Swear not; but I do not remember reading
anywhere in Holy Scripture that we are not to take another's oath. The question whether we ought to
take advantage of the concord which is established between other parties by their exchange of oaths
is entirely different. If we answer this in the negative, I know not whether we could find any place
on earth in which we could live. For not only on the frontier, but throughout all the provinces, the
security of peace rests on the oaths of barbarians. And from this it would follow, that not only the
crops which are guarded by men who have sworn fidelity in the name of their false gods, but all
things which enjoy the protection secured by the peace which a similar oath has ratified, are
defiled. If this be admitted by you to be a complete absurdity, dismiss with it your doubts on the
cases which you named.</P>

<P>3. Again, if from the threshing-floor or wine-press of a Christian anything be taken, with his
knowledge, to be offered to false gods, he is guilty in permitting this to be done, if it be in his
power to prevent it. If he finds that it has been done, or has not the power to prevent it, he uses
without scruple the rest of the grain or wine, as uncontaminated, just as we use fountains from which
we know that water has been taken to be used in idol-worship. The same principle decides the question
about baths. For we have no scruple about inhaling the air into which we know that the smoke from all
the altars and incense of idolaters ascends. From which it is manifest, that the thing forbidden is
our devoting anything to the honour of the false gods, or appearing to do this by so acting as to
encourage in such worship those who do not know our mind, although in our heart we despise their
idols. And when temples, idols, groves, etc., are thrown down by permission from the authorities,
although our taking part in this work is a clear proof of our not honouring, but rather abhorring,
these things, we must nevertheless forbear from appropriating any of them to our own personal and
private use; so that it may be manifest that in overthrowing these we are influenced, not by greed,
but by piety. When, however, the spoils of these places are applied to the benefit of the community
or devoted to the service of God, they are dealt with in the same manner as the men themselves when
they are turned from impiety and sacrilege to the true religion. We understand this to be the will of
God from the examples quoted by yourself: the grove of the false gods from which He commanded wood to
be taken [by Gideon] for the burnt-offering; and Jericho, of which all the gold, silver, and brass
was to be brought into the Lord's treasury. Hence also the precept in Deuteronomy: "Thou shalt not
desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it
is an abomination to the Lord thy God. Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
thou become a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor
it; for it is a cursed thing."<SUP><A HREF="#P3420_1388963">238</A></SUP> From which
it appears plainly, that either the appropriation of such spoils to their own private use was
absolutely forbidden, or they were forbidden to carry anything of that kind into their own houses
with the intention of giving to it honour; for then this would be an abomination and accursed in the
sight of God; whereas the honour impiously given to such idols is, by their public destruction,
utterly abolished.</P>

<P>4. As to meats offered to idols, I assure you we have no duty beyond observing what the apostle
taught concerning them. Study, therefore, his words on the subject, which, if they were obscure to
you, I would explain as well as I could. He does not sin who, unwittingly, afterwards partakes of
food which he formerly refused because it had been offered to an idol. A kitchen-herb, or any other
fruit of the ground, belongs to Him who created it; for "the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness
thereof," and "every creature of God is good."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3422_1389944">239</A></SUP> But if that which the earth has borne is
consecrated or offered to an idol, then we must reckon it among the things offered to idols. We must
beware lest, in pronouncing that we ought not to eat the fruits of a garden belonging to an
idol-temple, we be involved in the inference that it was wrong for the apostle to take food in
Athens, since that city belonged to Minerva, and was consecrated to her as the guardian deity. The
same answer I would give as to the well or fountain enclosed in a temple, though my scruples would be
somewhat more awakened if some part of the sacrifices be thrown into the said well or fountain. But
the case is, as I have said before, exactly parallel to our using of the air which receives the smoke
of these sacrifices; or, if this be thought to make a difference, that the sacrifice, the smoke
whereof mingles with the air, is not offered to the air itself, but to some idol or false god,
whereas sometimes offerings are cast into the water with the intention of sacrificing to the waters
themselves, it is enough to say that the same principle would preclude us from using the light of the
sun, because wicked men continually worship that luminary wherever they are tolerated in doing so.
Sacrifices are offered to the winds, which we nevertheless use for our convenience, although they
seem, as it were, to inhale and swallow greedily the smoke of these sacrifices. If any one be in
doubt regarding meat, whether it has been offered to an idol or not, and the fact be that it has not,
when he eats that meat under the impression that it has not been offered to an idol, he by no means
does wrong; because neither in fact, nor now in his judgment, is it food offered to an idol, although
he formerly thought it was. For surely it is lawful to correct false impressions by others that are
true. But if any one believes that to be good which is evil, and acts accordingly, he sins in
entertaining that belief; and these are all sins of ignorance, in which one thinks that to be right
which it is wrong for him to do.</P>

<P>5. As to killing others in order to defend one's own life, I do not approve of this, unless one
happen to be a soldier or public functionary acting, not for himself, but in defence of others or of
the city in which he resides, if he act according to the commission lawfully given him, and in the
manner becoming his office.<SUP><A HREF="#P3424_1392373">240</A></SUP> When,
however, men are prevented, by being alarmed, from doing wrong, it may be said that a real service is
done to themselves. The precept, "Resist not evil,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3425_1392743">241</A></SUP> was given to prevent us from taking pleasure in
revenge, in which the mind is gratified by the sufferings of others, but not to make us neglect the
duty of restraining men from sin. From this it follows that one is not guilty of homicide, because he
has put up a wall round his estate, if any one is killed by the wall falling upon him when he is
throwing it down. For a Christian is not guilty of homicide though his ox may gore or his horse kick
a man, so that he dies. On such a principle, the oxen of a Christian should have no horns, and his
horses no hoofs, and his dogs no teeth. On such a principle, when the Apostle Paul took care to
inform the chief captain that an ambush was laid for him by certain desperadoes, and received in
consequence an armed escort,<SUP><A HREF="#P3426_1393531">242</A></SUP> if the
villains who plotted his death had thrown themselves on the weapons of the soldiers, Paul would have
had to acknowledge the shedding of their blood as a crime with which he was chargeable. God forbid
that we should be blamed for accidents which, without our desire, happen to others through things
done by us or found in our possession, which are in themselves good and lawful. In that event, we
ought to have no iron implements for the house or the field, lest some one should by them lose his
own life or take another's no tree or tone on our premises, lest some one hang himself; no window in
our house, lest some one throw himself down from it. But why mention more in a list which must be
interminable? For what good and lawful thing is there in use among men which may not become
chargeable with being an instrument of destruction?</P>

<P>6. I have now only to notice (unless I am mistaken) the case which you mentioned of a Christian on
a journey overcome by the extremity of hunger; whether, if he could find nothing to eat but meat
placed in an idol's temple, and there was no man near to relieve him, it would be better for him to
die of starvation than to take that food for his nourishment? Since in this question it is not
assumed that the food thus found was offered to the idol (for it might have been left by mistake or
designedly by persons who, on a journey, had turned aside there to take refreshment; or it might have
been put there for some other purpose), I answer briefly thus: Either it is certain that this food
was offered to the idol, or it is certain that it was not, or neither of these things is known. If it
is certain, it is better to reject it with Christian fortitude. In either of the other alternatives,
it may be used for his necessity without any conscientious scruple.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter XLVIII.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 398.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Lord Eudoxius, My Brother and Fellow-Presbyter, Beloved and Longed For, and to the
Brethren Who are with Him,</I><SUP><A HREF="#P3432_1395504">243</A></SUP><I>
Augustin and the Brethren Who are Here Send Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. When we reflect upon the undisturbed rest which you enjoy in Christ, we also, although
engaged in labours manifold and arduous, find rest with you, beloved. We are one body under one Head,
so that you share our toils, and we share your repose: for "if one member suffer, all the members
suffer with it; or if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3434_1396072">244</A></SUP> Therefore we earnestly exhort and beseech you,
by the deep humility and most compassionate majesty of Christ, to be mindful of us in your holy
intercessions; for we believe you to be more lively and undistracted in prayer than we can be, whose
prayers are often marred and weakened by the darkness and confusion arising from secular occupations:
not that we have these on our own account, but we can scarcely breathe for the pressure of such
duties imposed upon us by men compelling us, so to speak, to go with them one mile, with whom we are
commanded by our Lord to go farther than they ask.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3435_1396689">245</A></SUP> We believe, nevertheless, that He before whom
the sighing of the prisoner comes<SUP><A HREF="#P3436_1396789">246</A></SUP> will
look on us persevering in the ministry in which He was pleased to put us, with promise of reward,
and, by the assistance of your prayers, will set us free from all distress.</P>

<P>2. We exhort you in the Lord, brethren, to be stedfast in your purpose, and persevere to the end;
and if the Church, your Mother, calls you to active service, guard against accepting it, on the one
hand, with too eager elation of spirit, or declining it, on the other, under the solicitations of
indolence; and obey God with a lowly heart, submitting yourselves in meekness to Him who governs you,
who will guide the meek in judgment, and will teach them His way.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3438_1397453">247</A></SUP> Do not prefer your own ease to the claims of the
Church; for if no good men were willing to minister to her in her bringing forth of her spiritual
children, the beginning of your own spiritual life would have been impossible. As men must keep the
way carefully in walking between fire and water, so as to be neither burned nor drowned, so must we
order our steps between the pinnacle of pride and the whirlpool of indolence; as it is written,
"declining neither to the right hand nor to the left."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3439_1397970">248</A></SUP> For some, while guarding too anxiously against
being lifted up and raised, as it were, to the dangerous heights on the right hand, have fallen and
been engulphed in the depths on the left. Again, others, while turning too eagerly from the danger on
the left hand of being immersed in the torpid effeminacy of inaction, are, on the other hand, so
destroyed and consumed by the extravagance of self-conceit, that they vanish into ashes and smoke.
See then, beloved, that in your love of ease you restrain yourselves from all mere earthly delight,
and remember that there is no place where the fowler who fears lest we fly back to God may not lay
snares for us; let us account him whose captives we once were to be the sworn enemy of all good men;
let us never consider ourselves in possession of perfect peace until iniquity shall have ceased, and
"judgment shall have returned unto righteousness."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3440_1398891">249</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3. Moreover, when you are exerting yourselves with energy and fervour, whatever you do, whether
labouring diligently in prayer, fasting, or almsgiving, or distributing to the poor, or forgiving
injuries, "as God also for Christ's sake hath forgiven us,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3442_1399178">250</A></SUP> or subduing evil habits, and chastening the body
and bringing it into subjection,<SUP><A HREF="#P3443_1399280">251</A></SUP> or
bearing tribulation, and especially bearing with one another in love (for what can he bear who is not
patient with his brother?), or guarding against the craft and wiles of the tempter, and by the shield
of faith averting and extinguishing his fiery darts,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3444_1399562">252</A></SUP> or "singing and making melody to the Lord in
your hearts," or with voices in harmony with your hearts;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3445_1399685">253</A></SUP> -whatever you do, I say, "do all to the glory of
God,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3446_1399759">254</A></SUP> who "worketh all in all,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3447_1399806">255</A></SUP> and be so "fervent in Spirit"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3448_1399859">256</A></SUP> that your "soul may make her boast in the
Lord."<SUP><A HREF="#P3449_1399929">257</A></SUP> Such is the course of those who
walk in the "straight way," whose "eyes are ever upon the Lord, for He shall pluck their feet out of
the net."<SUP><A HREF="#P3450_1400093">258</A></SUP> Such a course is neither
interrupted by business, nor benumbed by leisure, neither boisterous nor languid, neither
presumptuous nor desponding, neither reckless nor supine."These things do, and the God of peace shall
be with you."<SUP><A HREF="#P3451_1400344">259</A></SUP> </P>

<P>4. Let your charity prevent you from accounting me forward in wishing to address you by letter. I
remind you of these things, not because I think you come short in them, but because I thought that I
would be much commended unto God by you, if, in doing your duty to Him, you do it with a remembrance
of my exhortation. For good report, even before the coming of the brethren Eustasius and Andreas from
you, had brought to us, as they did, the good savour of Christ, which is yielded by your holy
conversation. Of these, Eustasius has gone before us to that land of rest, on the shore of which beat
no rude waves such as those which encompass your island home, and in which he does not regret
Caprera, for the homely raiment<SUP><A HREF="#P3453_1401088">260</A></SUP> with
which it furnished him he wears no more.</P>

Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>Earth reels and heaven trembles at the report of the enormous crime and unprecedented cruelty
which has made your streets and temples run red with blood, and ring with the shouts of murderers.
You have buried the laws of Rome in a dishonoured grave, and trampled in scorn the reverence due to
equitable enactments. The authority of emperors you neither respect nor fear. In your city there has
been shed the innocent blood of sixty of our brethren; and whoever approved himself most active in
the massacre, was rewarded with your applause, and with a high place in your Council. Come now, let
us arrive at the chief pretext for this outrage. If you say that Hercules belonged to you, by all
means we will make good your loss: we have metals at hand, and there is no lack of stone; nay, we
have several varieties of marble, and a host of artisans. Fear not, your god is in the hands of his
makers, and shall be with all diligence hewn out and polished and ornamented. We will give in
addition some red ochre, to make him blush in such a way as may well harmonize with your devotions.
Or if you say that the Hercules must be of your own making, we will raise a subscription in
pennies,<SUP><A HREF="#P3463_1403184">262</A></SUP> and buy a god from a workman of
your own for you. Only do you at the same time make restitution to us; and as your god Hercules is
given back to you, let the lives of the many men whom your violence has destroyed be given back to
us. </P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 399 on 400.)</P>

<P>An invitation to Crispinus, Donatist bishop at Calama, to discuss the whole question of the
Donatist schism.</P>

<P>(No salutation at the beginning of the letter.)</P>

<P>1. I have adopted this plan in regard to the heading of this letter, because your party are
offended by the humility which I have shown in the salutations prefixed to others. I might be
supposed to have done it as an insult to you, were it not that I trust that you will do the same in
your reply to me. Why should I say much regarding your promise at Carthage, and my urgency to have it
fulfilled? Let the manner in which we then acted to each other be forgotten with the past, lest it
should obstruct future conference. Now, unless I am mistaken, there is, by the Lord's help, no
obstacle in the way: we are both in Numidia, and located at no great distance from each other. I have
heard it said that you are still willing to examine, in debate with me, the question which separates
us from communion with each other. See how promptly all ambiguities may be cleared away: send me an
answer to this letter if you please, and perhaps that may be enough, not only for us, but for those
also who desire to hear us; or if it is not, let us exchange letters again and again until the
discussion is exhausted. For what greater benefit could be secured to us by the comparative nearness
of the towns which we inhabit? I have resolved to debate with you in no other way than by letters, in
order both to prevent anything that is said from escaping from our memory, and to secure that others
interested in the question, but unable to be present at a debate, may not forfeit the instruction.
You are accustomed, not with any intention of falsehood, but by mistake, to reproach us with charges
such as may suit your purpose, concerning past transactions, which we repudiate as untrue. Therefore,
if you please, let us weigh the question in the light of the present, and let the past alone. You are
doubtless aware that in the Jewish dispensation the sin of idolatry was committed by the people, and
once the book of the prophet of God was burned by a defiant king;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3470_1405581">263</A></SUP> the punishment of the sin of schism would not
have been more severe than that with which these two were visited, had not the guilt of it been
greater. You remember, of course, how the earth opening swallowed up alive the leaders of a schism,
and fire from heaven breaking forth destroyed their accomplices.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3471_1405911">264</A></SUP> Neither the making and worshipping of an idol,
nor the burning of the Holy Book, was deemed worthy of such punishment.</P>

<P>2. You are wont to reproach us with a crime, not proved against us, indeed, though proved beyond
question against some of your own party,-the crime, namely, of yielding up, through fear of
persecution, the Scriptures<SUP><A HREF="#P3473_1406270">265</A></SUP> to be burned.
Let me ask, therefore, why you have received back men whom you condemned for the crime of schism by
the "unerring voice of your plenary Council" (I quote from the record), and replaced them in the same
episcopal sees as they were in at the time when you passed sentence against them? I refer to
Felicianus of Musti and Praetextatus of Assuri.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3474_1406650">266</A></SUP> These were not, as you would have the ignorant
believe, included among those to whom your Council appointed and intimated a certain time, after the
lapse of which, if they had not returned to your communion, the sentence would become final; but they
were included among the others whom you condemned, without delay, on the day on which you gave to
some, as I have said, a respite. I can prove this, if you deny it. Your own Council is witness. We
have also the proconsular Acts, in which you have not once, but often, affirmed this. Provide,
therefore, some other line of defence if you can, lest, denying what I can prove, you cause loss of
time. If, then, Felicianus and Praetextatus were innocent, why were they thus condemned? If they were
guilty, why were they thus restored? If you prove them to have been innocent, can you object to our
believing that it was possible for innocent men, falsely charged with being traditors, to be
condemned by a much smaller number of your predecessors, if it is found possible for innocent men,
falsely charged with being schismatics, to be condemned by three hundred and ten of their successors,
whose decision is magniloquently described as proceeding from "the unerring voice of a plenary
Council"? If, however, you prove them to have been justly condemned, what can you plead in defence of
their being restored to office in the same episcopal sees, unless, magnifying the importance and
benefit of peace, you maintain that even such things as these should be tolerated in order to
preserve unbroken the I bond of unity? Would to God that you would urge this plea, not with the lips
only, but with the whole heart! You could not fail then to perceive that no calumnies whatever could
justify the breaking up of the peace of Christ throughout the world, if it is lawful in Africa for
men, once condemned for impious schism, to be restored to the same office which they held, rather
than break up the peace of Donatus and his party. </P>

<P>3. Again, you are wont to reproach us with persecuting you by the help of the civil power. In
regard to this, I do not draw an argument either from the demerit involved in the enormity of so
great an impiety, nor from the Christian meekness moderating the severity of our measures. I take up
this position: if this be a crime, why have you harshly persecuted the Maximianists by the help of
judges appointed by those emperors whose spiritual birth by the gospel was due to our Church? Why
have you driven them, by the din of controversy, the authority of edicts, and the violence of
soldiery, from those buildings for worship which they possessed, and in which they were when they
seceded from you? The wrongs endured by them in that struggle in every place are attested by the
existing traces of events so recent. Documents declare the orders given. The deeds done are notorious
throughout regions in which also the sacred memory of your leader Optatus is mentioned with
honour.</P>

<P>4. Again, you are wont to say that we have not the baptism of Christ, and that beyond your
communion it is not to be found. On this I would enter into a more lengthened argument; but in
dealing with you this is not necessary, seeing that, along with Felicianus and Praetextatus, you
admitted also the baptism of the Maximianists as valid. For all whom these bishops baptized so long
as they were in communion with Maximianus, while you were doing your utmost in a protracted contest
in the civil courts to expel these very men [Felicianus and Praetextatus] from their churches, as the
Acts testify,-all those, I say, whom they baptized during that time, they now have in fellowship with
them and with you; and though these were baptized by them when excommunicated and in the guilt of
schism, not only in cases of extremity through dangerous sickness, but also at the Easter services,
in the large number of churches belonging to their cities, and in these important cities
themselves,-in the case of none of them has the rite of baptism been repeated. And I wish you could
prove that those whom Felicianus and Praetextatus had baptized, as it were, in vain, when they were
excommunicated and in the guilt of schism, were satisfactorily baptized again by them when they were
restored. For if the renewal of baptism was necessary for the people, the renewal of ordination was
not less necessary for the bishops. For they had forfeited their episcopal office by leaving you, if
they could not baptize beyond your communion; because, if they had not forfeited their episcopal
office by leaving you, they could still baptize. But if they had forfeited their episcopal office,
they should have received ordination when they returned, so that what they had lost might be
restored. Let not this, however, alarm you. As it is certain that they returned with the same
standing as bishops with which they had gone forth from you, so is it also certain that they brought
back with themselves to your communion, without any repetition of their baptism, all those whom they
had baptized in the schism of Maximianus.</P>

<P>5. How can we weep enough when we see the baptism of the Maximianists acknowledged by you, and the
baptism of the Church universal despised? Whether it was with or without hearing their defence,
whether it was justly or unjustly, that you condemned Felicianus and Praetextatus, I do not ask; but
tell me what bishop of the Corinthian Church ever defended himself at your bar, or received sentence
from you? or what bishop of the Galatians has done so, or of the Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians,
Thessalonians, or of any of the other cities included in the promise: "All the kindreds of the
nations shall worship before Thee"?<SUP><A HREF="#P3478_1412642">267</A></SUP> Yet
you accept the baptism of the former, while that of the latter is despised; whereas baptism belongs
neither to the one nor to the other, but to Him of whom it was said: "This same is He that baptizeth
with the Holy Ghost."<SUP><A HREF="#P3479_1412890">268</A></SUP> I do not, however,
dwell on this in the meantime: take notice of the things which are beside us-behold what might make
an impression even on the blind! Where do we find the baptism which you acknowledge? With those,
forsooth, whom you have condemned, but not with those who were never even tried at your bar!-with
those who were denounced by name, and cast forth from you for the crime of schism, but not with those
who, unknown to you, and dwelling in remote lands, never were accused or condemned by you!-with those
who are but a fraction of the inhabitants of a fragment of Africa, but not with those from whose
country the gospel first came to Africa! Why should I add to your burden? Let me have an answer to
these things. Look to the charge made by your Council against the Maximianists as guilty of impious
schism: look to the persecutions by the civil courts to which you appealed against them: look to the
fact that you restored some of them without re-ordination, and accepted their baptism as valid: and
answer, if you can, whether it is in your power to hide, even from the ignorant, the question why you
have separated yourselves from the whole world, in a schism much more heinous than that which you
boast of having condemned in the Maximianists? May the peace of Christ triumph in your heart! Then
all shall be well.<SUP><A HREF="#P3480_1414243">269</A></SUP> </P>

Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. Since you were pleased to acquaint us with the letter sent to you by a Donatist presbyter,
although, with the spirit of a true Catholic, you regarded it with contempt, nevertheless, to aid you
in seeking his welfare if his folly be not incurable, we beg you to forward to him the following
reply. He wrote that an angel had enjoined him to declare to you the episcopal succession<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3490_1414998">270</A></SUP> of the Christianity of your town; to you,
forsooth, who hold the Christianity not of your own town only, nor of Africa only, but of the whole
world, the Christianity which has been published, and is now published to all nations. This proves
that they think it a small matter that they themselves are not ashamed of being cut off, and are
taking no measures, while they may, to be engrafted anew; they are not content unless they do their
utmost to cut others off, and bring them to share their own fate, as withered branches fit for the
flames. Wherefore, even if you had yourself been visited by that angel whom he affirms to have
appeared to him,-a statement which we regard as a cunning fiction; and if the angel had said to you
the very words which he, on the warrant of the alleged command, repeated to you,-even in that case it
would have been your duty to remember the words of the apostle: "Though we, or an angel from heaven,
preach any other gospel unto you than that we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3491_1416131">271</A></SUP> For to you it was proclaimed by the voice of the
Lord Jesus Christ Himself, that His "gospel shall be preached unto all nations, and then shall the
end come."<SUP><A HREF="#P3492_1416308">272</A></SUP> To you it has moreover been
proclaimed by the writings of the prophets and of the apostles, that the promises were given to
Abraham and to his seed, which is Christ,<SUP><A HREF="#P3493_1416497">273</A></SUP>
when God said unto him: "In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed." Having then such
promises, if an angel from heaven were to say to thee, "Let go the Christianity of the whole earth,
and cling to the faction of Donatus, the episcopal succession of which is set forth in a letter of
their bishop in your town," he ought to be accursed in your estimation; because he would be
endeavouring to cut you off from the whole Church, and thrust you into a small party, and make you
forfeit your interest in the promises of God.</P>

<P>2. For if the lineal succession of bishops is to be taken into account, with how much more
certainty and benefit to the Church do we reckon back till we reach Peter himself, to whom, as
bearing in a figure the whole Church,<SUP><A HREF="#P3495_1417275">274</A></SUP> the
Lord said: "Upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it!"<SUP><A HREF="#P3496_1417425">275</A></SUP> The successor of Peter was Linus,
and his successors in unbroken continuity were these:-Clement, Anacletus, Evaristus, Alexander,
Sixtus, Telesphorus, Iginus, Anicetus, Pius, Soter, Eleutherius, Victor, Zephirinus, Calixtus,
Urbanus, Pontianus, Antherus, Fabianus, Cornelius, Lucius, Stephanus, Xystus, Dionysius, Felix,
Eutychianus, Gaius, Marcellinus, Marcellus, Eusebius, Miltiades, Sylvester, Marcus, Julius, Liberius,
Damasus, and Siricius, whose successor is the present Bishop Anastasius. In this order of succession
no Donatist bishop is found. But, reversing the natural course of things, the Donatists sent to Rome
from Africa an ordained bishop, who, putting himself at the head of a few Africans in the great
metropolis, gave some notoriety to the name of "mountain men," or Cutzupits, by which they were
known.</P>

<P>3. Now, even although some traditor had in the course of these centuries, through inadvertence,
obtained a place in that order of bishops, reaching from Peter himself to Anastasius, who now
occupies that see,-this fact would do no harm to the Church and to Christians having no share in the
guilt of another; for the Lord, providing against such a case, says, concerning officers in the
Church who are wicked: "All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after
their works: for they say, and do not."<SUP><A HREF="#P3498_1418800">276</A></SUP>
Thus the stability of the hope of the faithful is secured, inasmuch as being fixed, not in man, but
in the Lord, it never can be swept away by the raging of impious schism; whereas they themselves are
swept away who read in the. Holy Scriptures the names of churches to which the apostles wrote, and in
which they have no bishop. For what could more clearly prove their perversity and their folly, than
their saying to their clergy, when they read these letters, "Peace be with thee,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3499_1419309">277</A></SUP> at the very time that they are themselves
disjoined from the peace of those churches to which the letters were originally written? </P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>4. Lest, however, he should congratulate himself too much on the succession of bishops in
Constantina, your own city, read to him the records of proceedings before Munatius Felix, the
resident Flamen [heathen priest], who was governor of your city in the consulship of Diocletian for
the eighth time, and Maximian for the seventh, on the eleventh day before the calends of June. By
these records it is proved that the bishop Paulus was a traditor; the fact being that Sylvanus was
then one of his sub-deacons, and, along with him, produced and surrendered certain things belonging
to the Lord's house, which had been most carefully concealed, namely a box<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3502_1420187">278</A></SUP> and a lamp of silver, upon seeing which a
certain Victor is reported to have said, "You would have been put to death if you had not found
these." Your Donatist priest makes great account of this Sylvanus, this clearly convicted traditor,
in the letter which he writes you, mentioning him as then ordained to the office of bishop by the
Primate Secundus of Tigisis. Let them keep their proud tongues silent, let them admit the charges
which may truly be brought against themselves, and not utter foolish calumnies against others. Read
to him also, if he permits it, the ecclesiastical records of the proceedings of this same Secundus of
Tigisis in the house of Urbanus Donatus, in which he remitted to God, as judge, men who confessed
themselves to have been traditors-Donatus of Masculi, Marinns of Aquae Tibilitanae, Donatus of
Calama, with whom as his colleagues, though they were confessed traditors, he ordained their bishop
Sylvanus, of whose guilt in the same matter I have given the history above. Read to him also the
proceedings before Zenophilus, a man of consular rank, in the course of which a certain deacon of
theirs, Nundinarius, being angry with Sylvanus for having excommunicated him, brought all these facts
into court, proving them incontestably by authentic documents, and the questioning of witnesses, and
the reading of public records and many letters.</P>

<P>5. There are many other things which you might read in his hearing, if he is disposed not to
dispute angrily, but to listen prudently, such as: the petition of the Donatists to Constantine,
begging him to send from Gaul bishops who should settle this controversy which divided the African
bishops; the Acts recording what took place in Rome, when the case was taken up and decided by the
bishops whom he sent thither: also you might read in other letters how the Emperor aforesaid states
that they had made a complaint to him against the decision of their peers-the bishops, namely, whom
he had sent to Rome; how he appointed other bishops to try the case over again at Arles; how they
appealed from that tribunal also to the Emperor again; how at last he himself investigated the
matter; and how he most emphatically declares that they were vanquisbed by the innocence of
Caecilianus. Let him listen to these things if he be willing, and he will be silent and desist from
plotting against the truth.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>6. We rely, however, not so much on these documents as on the Holy Scriptures, wherein a dominion
extending to the ends of the earth among all nations is promised as the heritage of Christ, separated
from which by their sinful schism they reproach us with the crimes which belong to the chaff in the
Lord's threshingfloor, which must be permitted to remain mixed with the good grain until the end
come, until the whole be winnowed in the final judgment. From which it is manifest that, whether
these charges be true or false, they do not belong to the Lord's wheat,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3506_1423157">279</A></SUP> which must grow until the end of the world
throughout the whole field, <I>i.e.</I> the whole earth; as we know, not by the testimony of a false
angel such as confirmed your correspondent in his error, but from the words of the Lord in the
Gospel. And because these unhappy Donatists have brought the reproach of many false and empty
accusations against Christians who were blameless, but who are throughout the world mingled with the
chaff or tares, <I>i.e.</I> with Christians unworthy of the name, therefore God has, in righteous
retribution, appointed that they should, by their universal Council, condemn as schismatics the
Maximianists, because they bad condemned Primianus, and baptized while not in communion with
Primianus, and rebaptized those whom he had baptized, and then after a short interval should, under
the coercion of Optatus the minion of Gildo, reinstate in the honours of their office two of these,
the bishops Felicianus of Musti and Praetextatus of Assuri, and acknowledge the baptism of all whom
they, while under sentence and excommunicated, had baptized. If, therefore, they are not defiled by
communion with the men thus restored again to their office,-men whom with their own mouth they had
condemned as wicked and impious, and whom they compared to those first heretics whom the earth
swallowed up alive,<SUP><A HREF="#P3507_1424502">280</A></SUP> -let them at last
awake and consider how great is their blindness and folly in pronouncing the whole world defiled by
unknown crimes of Africans, and the heritage of Christ (which according to the promise has been shown
unto all nations) destroyed through the sins of these Africans by the maintenance ofcommunion with
them; while they refuse to acknowledge themselves to be destroyed and defiled by communicating with
men whose crimes they had both known and condemned.</P>

<P>7. Wherefore, since the Apostle Paul says in another place, that even Satan transforms himself
into an angel of light, and that therefore it is not strange that his servants should assume the
guise of ministers of righteousness:<SUP><A HREF="#P3509_1425225">281</A></SUP> if
your correspondent did indeed see an angel teaching him error, and desiring to separate Christians
from the Catholic unity, he has met with an angel of Satan transforming himself into an angel of
light. If, however, he has lied to you, and has seen no such vision, he is himself a servant of
Satan, assuming the guise of a minister of righteousness. And yet, if he be not incorrigibly
obstinate and perverse, he may, by considering all the things now stated, be delivered both from
misleading others, and from being himself misled. For, embracing the opportunity which you have
given, we have met him without any rancour, remembering in regard to him the words of the apostle:
"The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient; in
meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to
the acknowledging of the truth; and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil,
who are taken captive by him at his will."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3510_1426270">282</A></SUP> If, therefore, we have said anything severe, let
him know that it arises not from the bitterness of controversy, but from love vehemently desiring his
return to the right path. May you live safe in Christ, most beloved and honourable brother!</P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. In regard to the questions which you have asked me, I would like to have known what your own
answers would have been; for thus I might have made my reply in fewer words, and might most easily
confirm or correct your opinions, by approving or amending the answers which you had given. This I
would have greatly preferred. But desiring to answer you at once, I think it better to write a long
letter than incur loss of time. I desire you therefore, in the first place, to hold fast this as the
fundamental principle in the present discussion, that our Lord Jesus Christ has appointed to us a
"light yoke" and an "easy burden," as He declares in the Gospel:<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3518_1427349">283</A></SUP> in accordance with which He has bound His people
under the new dispensation together in fellowship by sacraments, which are in number very few, in
observance most easy, and in significance most excellent, as baptism solemnized in the name of the
Trinity, the communion of His body and blood, and such other things as are prescribed in the
canonical Scriptures, with the exception of those enactments which were a yoke of bondage to God's
ancient people, suited to their state of heart and to the times of the prophets, and which are found
in the five books of Moses. As to those other things which we hold on the authority, not of
Scripture, but of tradition, and which are observed throughout the whole world, it may be understood
that they are held as approved and instituted either by the apostles themselves, or by plenary
Councils, whose authority in the Church is most useful, <I>e.g.</I> the annual commemoration, by
special solemnities, of the Lord's passion, resurrection, and ascension, and of the descent of the
Holy Spirit from heaven, and whatever else is in like manner observed by the whole Church wherever it
has been established.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>2. There are other things, however, which are different in different places and countries:
<I>e.g.</I>, some fast on Saturday, others do not; some partake daily of the body and blood of
Christ, others receive it on stated days: in some places no day passes without the sacrifice being
offered; in others it is only on Saturday and the Lord's day, or it may be only on the Lord's day. In
regard to these and all other variable observances which may be met anywhere, one is at liberty to
comply with them or not as he chooses; and there is no better rule for the wise and serious Christian
in this matter, than to conform to the practice which he finds prevailing in the Church to which it
may be his lot to come. For such a custom, if it is clearly not contrary to the faith nor to sound
morality, is to be held as a thing indifferent, and ought to be observed for the sake of fellowship
with those among whom we live.</P>

<P>3. I think you may have heard me relate before,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3522_1429477">284</A></SUP> what I will nevertheless now mention. When my
mother followed me to Milan, she found the Church there not fasting on Saturday. She began to be
troubled, and to hesitate as to what she should do; upon which I, though not taking a personal
interest then in such things, applied on her behalf to Ambrose, of most blessed memory, for his
advice. He answered that he could not teach me anything but what he himself practised, because if he
knew any better rule, he would observe it himself. When I supposed that he intended, on the ground of
his authority alone, and without supporting it by any argument, to recommend us to give up fasting on
Saturday, he followed me, and said: "When I visit Rome, I fast on Saturday; when I am here, I do not
fast. On the same principle, do you observe the custom prevailing in whatever Church you come to, if
you desire neither to give offence by your conduct, nor to find cause of offence in another's." When
I reported this to my mother, she accepted it gladly; and for myself, after frequently reconsidering
his decision, I have always esteemed it as if I had received it by an oracle from heaven. For often
have I perceived, with extreme sorrow, many disquietudes caused to weak brethren by the contentious
pertinacity or superstitious vacillation of some who, in matters of this kind, which do not admit of
final decision by the authority of Holy Scripture, or by the tradition of the universal Church or by
their manifest good influence on manners raise questions, it may be, from some crotchet of their own,
or from attachment to the custom followed in one's own country, or from preference for that which one
has seen abroad, supposing that wisdom is increased in proportion to the distance to which men travel
from home, and agitate these questions with such keenness, that they think all is wrong except what
they do themselves.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>4. Some one may say, "The Eucharist ought not to be taken every day." You ask, "On what grounds?"
He answers, "Because, in order that a man may approach worthily to so great a sacrament, he ought to
choose those days upon which he lives in more special purity and self-restraint; for `whosoever
eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself.'"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3525_1431774">285</A></SUP> Another answers, "Certainly; if the wound
inflicted by sin and the violence of the soul's distemper be such that the use of these remedies must
be put off for a time, every man in this case should be, by the authority of the bishop, forbidden to
approach the altar, and appointed to do penance, and should be afterwards restored to privileges by
the same authority; for this would be partaking unworthily, if one should partake of it at a time
when he ought to be doing penance,<SUP><A HREF="#P3526_1432276">286</A></SUP> and it
is not a matter to be left to one's own judgment to withdraw himself from the communion of the
Church, or restore himself, as he pleases. If, however, his sins are not so great as to bring him
justly under sentence of excommunication, he ought not to withdraw himself from the daily use of the
Lord's body for the healing of his soul." Perhaps a third party interposes with a more just decision
of the question, reminding them that the principal thing is to remain united in the peace of Christ,
and that each should be free to do what, according to his belief, he conscientiously regards as his
duty. For neither of them lightly esteems the body and blood of the Lord; on the contrary, both are
contending who shall most highly honour the sacrament fraught with blessing. There was no controversy
between those two mentioned in the Gospel, Zacchaeus and the Centurion; nor did either of them think
himself better than the other, though, whereas the former received the Lord joyfully into his
house,<SUP><A HREF="#P3527_1433311">287</A></SUP> the latter said, "I am not worthy
that Thou shouldest come under my roof,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3528_1433407">288</A></SUP>
-both honouring the Saviour, though in ways diverse and, as it were, mutually opposed; both miserable
through sin, and both obtaining the mercythey required. We may further borrow an illustration here,
from the fact that the manna given to the ancient people of God tasted in each man's mouth as he
desired that it might.<SUP><A HREF="#P3529_1433752">289</A></SUP> It is the same
with this world-sabduing sacrament in the heart of each Christian. For he that dares not take it
every day, and he who dares not omit it any day, are both alike moved by a desire to do it honour.
That sacred food will not submit to be despised, as the manna could not be loathed with impunity.
Hence the apostle says that it was unworthily partaken of by those who did not distinguish between
this and all other meats, by yielding to it the special veneration which was due; for to the words
quoted already, "eateth and drinketh judgment to himself," he has added these, "not discerning the
Lord's body;" and this is apparent from the whole of that passage in the first Epistle to the
Corinthians, if it be carefully studied.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>5. Suppose some foreigner visit a place in which during Lent it is customary to abstain from the
use of the bath, and to continue fasting on Thursday. "I will not fast today," he says. The reason
being asked, he says, "Such is not the custom in my own country." Is not he, by such conduct,
attempting to assert the superiority of his custom over theirs? For he cannot quote a decisive
passage on the subject from the Book of God; nor can he prove his opinion to be right by the
unanimous voice of the universal Church, wherever spread abroad; nor can he demonstrate that they act
contrary to the faith, and he according to it, or that they are doing what is prejudicial to sound
morality, and he is defending its interests. Those men injure their own tranquillity and peace by
quarrelling on an unnecessary question. I would rather recommend that, in matters of this kind, each
man should, when sojourning in a country in which he finds a custom different from his own consent to
do as others do. If, on the other hand, a Christian, when travelling abroad in some region where the
people of God are more numerous, and more easily assembled together, and more zealous in religion,
has seen, <I>e.g.</I>, the sacrifice twice offered, both morning and evening, on the Thursday of the
last week in Lent, and therefore, on his coming back to his own country, where it is offered only at
the close of the day, protests against this as wrong and unlawful, because he has himself seen
another custom in another land, this would show a childish weakness of judgment against which we
should guard ourselves, and which we must bear with in others, but correct in all who are under our
influence.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>6. Observe now to which of these three classes the first question in your letter is to be
referred. You ask, "What ought to be done on the Thursday of the last week of Lent? Ought we to offer
the sacrifice in the morning, and again after supper, on account of the words in the Gospel,
`Likewise also . . . after supper'?<SUP><A HREF="#P3534_1436960">290</A></SUP> Or
ought we to fast and offer the sacrifice only after supper? Or ought we to fast until the offering
has been made, and then take supper as we are accustomed to do?" I answer, therefore, that if the
authority of Scripture has decided which of these methods is right, there is no room for doubting
that we should do according to that which is written; and our discussion must be occupied with a
question, not of duty, but of interpretation as to the meaning of the divine institution. In like
manner, if the universal Church follows any one! of these methods, there is no room for doubt as: to
our duty; for it would be the height of arrogant madness to discuss whether or not we should comply
with it. But the question which you propose is not decided either by Scripture or by universal
practice. It must therefore be referred to the third class-as pertaining, namely, to things which are
different in different places and countries. Let every man, therefore, conform himself to the usage
prevailing in the Church to which he may come. For none of these methods is contrary to the Christian
faith or the interests of morality, as favoured by the adoption of one custom more than the other. If
this were the case, that either the faith or sound morality were at stake, it would be necessary
either to change what was done amiss, or to appoint the doing of what had been neglected. But mere
change of custom, even though it may be of advantage in some respects, unsettles men by reason of the
novelty: therefore, if it brings no advantage, it does much harm by unprofitably disturbing the
Church.</P>

<P>7. Let me add, that it would be a mistake to suppose that the custom prevalent in many places, of
offering the sacrifice on that day after partaking of food, is to be traced to the words, "Likewise
after supper," etc. For the Lord might give the name of supper to what they had received, in already
partaking of His body, so that it was after this that they partook of the cup: as the apostle says in
another place, "When ye come together into one place, this is not to <I>eat</I><SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3536_1439053">291</A></SUP> the Lord's Supper,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3537_1439091">292</A></SUP> giving to the receiving of the Eucharist to that
extent (<I>i.e.</I> the eating of the bread) the name of the Lord's Supper.</P>

<P>Chap. VI.</P>

<P>As to the question whether upon that day it is right to partake of food before either offering or
partaking of the Eucharist, these words in the Gospel might go far to decide our minds, "As they were
eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it;" taken in connection with the words in the preceding
context, "When the even was come, He sat down with the twelve: and as they did eat, He said, Verily I
say unto you, that one of you shall betray Me." For it was after that that He instituted the
sacrament; and it is clear that when the disciples first received the body and blood of the Lord,
they had not been fasting.</P>

<P>8. Must we therefore censure the universal Church because the sacrament is everywhere partaken of
by persons fasting? Nay, verily, for from that time it pleased the Holy Spirit to appoint, for the
honour of so great a sacrament, that the body of the Lord should take the precedence of all other
food entering the mouth of a Christian; and it is for this reason that the custom referred to is
universally observed. For the fact that the Lord instituted the sacrament after other food had been
partaken of, does not prove that brethren should come together to partake of that sacrament after
having dined or supped, or imitate those whom the apostle reproved and corrected for not
distinguishing between the Lord's Supper and an ordinary meal. The Saviour, indeed, in order to
commend the depth of that mystery more affectingly to His disciples, was pleased to impress it on
their hearts and memories by making its institution His last act before going from them to His
Passion. And therefore He did not prescribe the order in which it was to be observed, reserving this
to be done by the apostles, through whom He intended to arrange all things pertaining to the
Churches. Had He appointed that the sacrament should be always partaken of after other food, I
believe that no one would have departed from that practice. But when the apostle, speaking of this
sacrament, says, "Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another: and if
any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation," he immediately
adds, "and the rest will I set in order when I come."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3541_1441463">293</A></SUP> Whence we are given to understand that, since it
was too much for him to prescribe completely in an epistle the method observed by the universal
Church throughout the world, it was one of the things set in order by him in person, for we find its
observance uniform amid all the variety of other customs.</P>

<P>Chap. VII.</P>

<P>9. There are, indeed, some to whom it has seemed right (and their view is not unreasonable), that
it is lawful for the body and blood of the Lord to be offered and received after other food has been
partaken of, on one fixed day of the year, the day on which the Lord instituted the Supper, in order
to give special solemnity to the service on that anniversary. I think that, in this case, it would be
more seemly to have it celebrated at such an hour as would leave it in the power of any who have
fasted to attend the service before<SUP><A HREF="#P3544_1442337">294</A></SUP> the
repast which is customary at the ninth hour. Wherefore we neither compel nor do we dare to forbid any
one to break his fast before the Lord's Supper on that day. I believe, however, that the real ground
upon which this custom rests is, that many, nay, almost all, are accustomed in most places to use the
bath on that day. And because some continue to faust, it is offered in the morning, for those who
take food, because they cannot bear fasting and the use of the bath at the same time; and in: the
evening, for those who have fasted all day.</P>

<P>10. If you ask me whence originated the custom of using the bath on that day, nothing occurs to
me, when I think of it, as more likely than that it was to avoid the offence to decency which must
have been given at the baptismal font, if the bodies of those to whom that rite was to be
administered were not washed on some preceding day from the uncleanness consequent upon their strict
abstinence from ablutions during Lent; and that this particular day was chosen for the purpose
because of its being the anniversary of the institution of the Supper. And this being granted to
those who were about to receive baptism, many others desired to join them in the luxury of a bath,
and in relaxation of their fast.</P>

<P>Having discussed these questions to the best of my ability, I exhort you to observe, in so far as
you may be able, what I have laid down, as becomes a wise and peace-loving son of the Church. The
remainder of your questions I purpose, if the Lord will, to answer at another time.</P>

<P>(a.d. 400.)</P>

<P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. Having read the letter in which you have put me in mind of my obligation to give answers to the
remainder of those questions which you submitted to me a long time ago, I cannot bear to defer any
longer the gratification of that desire for instruction which it gives me so much pleasure and
comfort to see in you; and although encompassed by an accumulation of engagements, I have given the
first place to the work of supplying you with the answers desired. I will make no further comment on
the contents of your letter, lest my doing so should prevent me from paying at length what I owe.</P>

<P>2. You ask, "Wherefore does the anniversary on which we celebrate the Passion of the Lord not
fall, like the day which tradition has handed down as the day of His birth, on the same day every
year?" and you add, "If the reason of this is connected with the week and the month, what have we to
do with the day of the week or the state of the moon in this solemnity?" The first thing which you
must know and remember here is, that the observance of the Lord's natal day is not sacramental, but
only commemorative of His birth, and that therefore no more was in this case necessary, than that the
return of the day on which the event took place should be marked by an annual religious festival. The
celebration of an event becomes sacramental in its nature, only when the commemoration of the event
is so ordered that it is understood to be significant of something which is to be received with
reverence as sacred.<SUP><A HREF="#P3554_1445589">295</A></SUP> Therefore we observe
Easter<SUP><A HREF="#P3555_1445645">296</A></SUP> in such a manner as not only to
recall the facts of the death and resurrection of Christ to remembrance, but also to find a place for
all the other things which, in connection with these events, give evidence as to the import of the
sacrament. For since, as the apostle wrote, "He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again
for our justification,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3556_1446019">297</A></SUP> a certain
transition from death to life has been consecrated in that Passion and Resurrection of the Lord. For
the word Pascha itself is not, as is commonly thought, a Greek word: those who are acquainted with
both languages affirm it to be a Hebrew word. It is not derived, therefore, from the Passion, because
of the Greek word <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>paskein</FONT>, signifying to suffer, but it takes its name
from the transition, of which I have spoken, from death to life; the meaning of the Hebrew word
Pascha being, as those who are acquainted with it assure us,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3557_1446580">298</A></SUP> a passing over or transition. To this the Lord
Himself designed to allude, when He said," He that believeth in Me is passed from death to
life."<SUP><A HREF="#P3558_1446888">299</A></SUP> And the same evangelist who
records that saying is to be understood as desiring to give emphatic testimony to this, when,
speaking of the Lord as about to celebrate with His disciples the passover, at which He instituted
the sacramental supper, he says, "When Jesus knew that His hour was come, that He should
depart<SUP><A HREF="#P3559_1447224">300</A></SUP> from this world unto the
Father."<SUP><A HREF="#P3560_1447276">301</A></SUP> This passing over from this
mortal life to the other, the immortal life, that is, from death to life, is set forth in the Passion
and Resurrection of the Lord.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. This passing from death to life is meanwhile wrought in us by faith, which we have for the
pardon of our sins and the hope of eternal life, when we love God and our neighbour; "for faith
worketh by love,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3563_1447673">302</A></SUP> and "the just shall
hive by his faith;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3564_1447731">303</A></SUP> "and hope that is
seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not,
then do we with patience wait for it."<SUP><A HREF="#P3565_1447909">304</A></SUP>
According to this faith and hope and love, by which we have begun to be "under grace," we are already
dead together with Christ, and buried together with Him by baptism into death;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3566_1448116">305</A></SUP> as the apostle hath said, "Our old man is
crucified with Him;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3567_1448214">306</A></SUP> and we have risen
with Him, for "He hath raised us up together, and made us sit with Him in heavenly places."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3568_1448343">307</A></SUP> Whence also he gives this exhortation: "If ye
then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand
of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3569_1448582">308</A></SUP> In the next words, "For ye are dead, and your
life is hid with Christ in God; when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with Him in glory,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3570_1448773">309</A></SUP> he plainly gives us
to understand that our passing in this present time from death to life by faith is accomplished in
the hope of that future final resurrection and glory, when "this corruptible," that is, this flesh in
which we now groan, "shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3571_1449108">310</A></SUP> For now, indeed, we have by faith "the
first-fruits of the Spirit;" but still we "groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit,
the redemption of the body: for we are saved by hope." While we are in this hope, "the body indeed is
dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." Now mark what follows: "But if
the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the
dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3572_1449655">311</A></SUP> The whole Church, therefore, while here in the
conditions of pilgrimage and mortality, expects that to be accomplished in her at the end of the
world which has been shown first in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is "the first-begotten
from the dead," seeing that the body of which He is the Head is none other than the Church.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3573_1450022">312</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>4. Some, indeed, studying the words so frequently used by the apostle, about our being dead with
Christ and raised together with Him, and misunderstanding the sense in which they are used, have
thought that the resurrection is already past, and that no other is to be hoped for at the end of
time: "Of whom," he says, "are Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying
that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3576_1450515">313</A></SUP> The same apostle who thus reproves and testifies
against them, teaches nevertheless that we are risen with Christ. How is the apparent contradiction
to be removed, unless he means that this is accomplished in us by faith and hope and love, according
to the first-fruits of the Spirit? But because "hope which is seen is not hope," and therefore "if we
hope for that we see not, we do with patience wait for it," it is beyond question that there remains,
as still future, the redemption of the body, in longing for which we "groan within ourselves." Hence
also that saying, "Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3577_1451155">314</A></SUP> </P>

<P>5. This renewal, therefore, of our life is a kind of transition from death to life which is made
first by faith, so that we rejoice in hope and are patient in tribulation, while still "our outward
man perisheth, but the inward man is renewed day by day."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3579_1451431">315</A></SUP> It is because of this beginning of a new life,
because of the new man which we are commanded to put on, putting off the old man,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3580_1451581">316</A></SUP> "purging out the old leaven, that we may be a
new lump, because Christ our passover is sacrificed for us;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3581_1451712">317</A></SUP> it is, I say, because of this newness of life in
us, that the first of the months of the year has been appointed as the season of this solemnity. This
very name is given to it, the month Abib, or beginning of months.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3582_1451950">318</A></SUP> Again, the resurrection of the Lord was upon the
third day, because with it the third epoch of the world began. The first Epoch was before the Law,
the second under the Law, the third under Grace, in which there is now the manifestation of the
mystery,<SUP><A HREF="#P3583_1452226">319</A></SUP> which was formerly hidden under
dark prophetic sayings. This is accordingly signified also in the part of the month appointed for the
celebration; for, since the number seven is usually employed in Scripture as a mystical number,
indicating perfection of some kind, the day of the celebration of Easter is within the third week of
the month, namely, between the fourteenth and the twenty-first day.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>6. There is in this another mystery,<SUP><A HREF="#P3586_1452691">320</A></SUP>
and you are not to be distressed if perhaps it be not so readily perceived by you, because of your
being less versed in such studies; nor are you to think me any better than you, because I learned
these things in early years: for the Lord saith, "Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he
understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3587_1453055">321</A></SUP> Some men who give attention to such studies,
have investigated many things concerning the numbers and motions of the heavenly bodies. And those
who have done this most ably have found that the waxing and waning of the moon are due to the turning
of its globe, and not to any such actual addition to or diminution of its substance as is supposed by
the foolish Manichaeans, who say that as a ship is filled, so the moon is filled with a fugitive
portion of the Divine Being, which they, with impious heart and lips, do not hesitate to believe and
to declare to have become mingled with the rulers of darkness, and contaminated with their pollution.
And they account for the waxing of the moon by saying that it takes place when that lost portion of
the Deity, being purified from contamination by great labours, escaping from the whole world,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3588_1453918">322</A></SUP> and from all foul abominations,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3589_1453966">323</A></SUP> is restored to the Deity, who mourns till it
returns; that by this the moon is filled up till the middle of the month, and that in the latter half
of the month this is poured back into the sun as into another ship. Amid these execrable blasphemies,
they have never succeeded in devising any way of explaining why the moon in the beginning or end of
its brightness shines with its light in the shape of a horn, or why it begins at the middle of the
month to wane, and does not go on full until it pour back its increase into the sun.</P>

<P>7. Those, however, to whom I refer have inquired into these things with trustworthy calculations,
so that they can not only state the reason of eclipses, both solar and lunar, but also predict their
occurrence long before they take place, and are able to determine by mathematical computation the
precise intervals at which these must happen, and to state the results in treatises, by reading and
understanding which any others may foretell as well as they the coming of these eclipses, and find
their prediction verified by the event. Such men,-and they deserve censure, as Holy Scripture
teaches, because "though they had wisdom enough to measure the periods of this world, they did not
much more easily come," as by humble piety they might have done, "to the knowledge of its
Lord,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3591_1455301">324</A></SUP> -such men, I say, have inferred
from the horns of the moon, which both in waxing and in waning are turned from the sun, either that
the moon is illuminated by the sun, and that the farther it recedes from the sun the more fully does
it lie exposed to its rays on the side which is visible from the earth; but that the more it
approaches the sun, after the middle of the month, on the other half of its orbit, it becomes more
fully illuminated on the upper part, and less and less open to receive the sun's rays on the side
which is turned to the earth, and seems to us accordingly to decrease: or, that if the moon has light
in itself, it has this light in the hemisphere on one side only, which side it gradually turns more
to the earth as it recedes from the sun, until it is fully displayed, thereby exhibiting an apparent
increase, not by the addition of what was deficient, but by disclosing what was already there; and
that, in like manner, going towards the sun, the moon again gradually turns from our view that which
had been disclosed, and so appears to decrease. Whichever of these two theories be correct, this at
least is plain, and is easily discovered by any careful observer, that the moon does not to our eyes
increase except when it is receding from the sun, nor decrease except when returning towards the
sun.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>8. Now mark what is said in Proverbs: "The wise man is fixed like the sun; but the fool changes
like the moon."<SUP><A HREF="#P3594_1456772">325</A></SUP> And who is the wise that
has no changes, but that Sun of Righteousness of whom it is said, "The Sun of righteousness has risen
upon me," and of which the wicked shall say, when mourning in the day of judgment that it has not
risen upon them, "The light of righteousness hath not shone upon us, and the sun hath not risen upon
us "?<SUP><A HREF="#P3595_1457131">326</A></SUP> For that sun which is visible to
the eye of sense, God makes to rise upon the evil and the good alike, as He sendeth rain upon the
just and the unjust;<SUP><A HREF="#P3596_1457303">327</A></SUP> but apt similitudes
are often borrowed from things visible to explain things invisible. Again, who is the "fool" who
"changes like the moon," if not Adam, in whom all have sinned? For the soul of man, receding from the
Sun of righteousness, that is to say, from the internal contemplation of unchangeable truth, turns
all its strength towards external things, and becomes more and more darkened in its deeper and nobler
powers; but when the soul begins to return to that unchangeable wisdom, the more it draws near to it
with pious desire, the more does the outward man perish, but the inward man is renewed day by day,
and all that light of the soul which was inclining to things that are beneath is turned to the things
that are above, and is thus withdrawn from the things of earth; so that it dies more and more to this
world, and its life is hid with Christ in God.</P>

<P>9. It is therefore for the worse that the soul is changed when it moves in the direction of
external things, and throws aside that which pertains to the inner life; and to the earth,
<I>i.e.</I> to those who mind earthly things, the soul looks better in such a case, for by them the
wicked is commended for his heart's desire, and the unrighteous is blessed.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3598_1458546">328</A></SUP> But it is for the better that the soul is
changed, when it gradually turns away its aims and ambition from earthly things, which appear
important in this world, and directs them to things nobler and unseen; and to the earth, <I>i.e.</I>
to men who mind earthly things, the soul in such a case seems worse. Hence those wicked men who at
last shall in vain repent of their sins, will say this among other things: "These are the men whom
once we derided and reproached; we in our folly esteemed their way of life to be madness."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3599_1459102">329</A></SUP> Now the Holy Spirit, drawing a comparison from
things visible to things invisible, from things corporeal to spiritual mysteries, has been pleased to
appoint that the feast symbolical of the passing from the old life to the new, which is signified by
the name Pascha, should be observed between the 14th and 21st days of the month,-after the 14th, in
order that a twofold illustration of spiritual realities might be gained, both with respect to the
third epoch of the world, which is the reason of its occurrence in the third week, as I have already
said, and with respect to the turning of the soul from external to internal things,-a change
corresponding to the change in the moon when on the wane; not later than the 21st, because of the
number 7 itself, which is often used to represent the notion of the universe, and is also applied to
the Church on the ground of her likeness to the universe.</P>

<P>Chap. VI.</P>

<P>10. For this reason the Apostle John writes in the Apocalypse to seven churches.The Church,
moreover, while it remains under the conditions of our mortal life in the flesh, is, on account of
her liability to change, spoken of Scripture by the name of the moon; <I>e.g.</I>, "They have made
ready their arrows in the quiver, that they may, while the moon is obscured, wound those who are
upright in heart."<SUP><A HREF="#P3602_1460432">330</A></SUP> For before that comes
to pass of which the apostle says, "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
appear with Him in glory,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3603_1460681">331</A></SUP> the Church
seems in the time of her pilgrimage obscured, groaning under many iniquities; and at such a time, the
snares of those who deceive and lead astray are to be feared, and these are intended by the word
"arrows" in this passage. Again, we have another instance in Psalm lxxxix.,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3604_1460988">332</A></SUP> where, because of the faithful witnesses which
she everywhere brings forth on the side of truth, the Church is called "the moon, a faithful witness
in heaven." And when the Psalmist sang of the Lord's kingdom, he said, "In His days shall be
righteousness and abundance of peace, until the moon be destroyed;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3605_1461314">333</A></SUP> <I>i.e.</I> abundance of peace shall increase so
greatly, until He shall at length take away all the changeableness incidental to this mortal
condition. Then shall death, the last enemy, be destroyed; and whatever obstacle to the perfection of
our peace is due to the infirmity of our flesh shall be utterly consumed when this corruptible shall
have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3606_1461767">334</A></SUP> We have another instance in this, that the walls
of the town named Jericho-which in the Hebrew tongue is said to signify "moon "-fell when they had
been compassed for the seventh time by the ark of the covenant borne round the city. For what else is
conveyed by the promise of the coming of the heavenly kingdom, which was symbolized in the carrying
of the ark round Jericho, than that all the strongholds of this mortal life, <I>i.e.</I> every hope
pertaining to this world which resists the hope of the world to come, must be destroyed, with the
soul's free consent, by the sevenfold gift of the Holy Spirit. Therefore it was, that when the ark
was going round, those walls fell, not by violent assault, but of themselves. There are, besides
these, other passages in Scripture which, speaking of the moon, impress upon us under that figure the
condition of the Church while here, amid cares and labours, she is a pilgrim under the lot of
mortality, and far from that Jerusalem of which the holy angels are the citizens.</P>

<P>11. These foolish men who refuse to be changed for the better have no reason, however, to imagine
that worship is due to those heavenly luminaries because a similitude is occasionally borrowed from
them for the representation of divine mysteries; for such are borrowed from every created thing. Nor
is there any reason for our incurring the sentence of condemnation which is pronounced by the apostle
on some who worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3608_1463308">335</A></SUP> We do not adore sheep or cattle, although Christ
is called both a Lamb,<SUP><A HREF="#P3609_1463399">336</A></SUP> and by the prophet
a young bullock;<SUP><A HREF="#P3610_1463454">337</A></SUP> nor any beast of prey,
though He is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3611_1463554">338</A></SUP> nor a stone, although Christ is called a
Rock;<SUP><A HREF="#P3612_1463620">339</A></SUP> nor Mount Zion, though in it there
was a type of the Church.<SUP><A HREF="#P3613_1463702">340</A></SUP> And, in like
manner, we do not adore the sun or the moon, although, in order to convey instruction in holy
mysteries, figures of sacred things are borrowed from these celestial works of the Creator, as they
are also from many of the things which He hath made on earth.</P>

<P>Chap. VII.</P>

<P>12. We are therefore bound to denounce with abhorrence and contempt the ravings of the
astrologers, who, when we find fault with the empty inventions by which they cast other men down into
the delusions where into they themselves have fallen, imagine that they answer well when they say,
"Why, then, do you regulate the time of the observance of Easter by calculation of the positions of
the sun and moon?"-as if that with which we find fault was the arrangements of the heavenly bodies,
or the succession of the seasons, which are appointed by God in His infinite power and goodness, and
not their perversity in abusing, for the support of the most absurd opinions, those things which God
has ordered in perfect wisdom. If the astrologer may on this ground forbid us from drawing
comparisons from the heavenly bodies for the mystical representation of sacramental realities, then
the augurs may with equal reason prevent the use of these words of Scripture, "Be harmless as doves;"
and the snake-charmers may forbid that other exhortation, "Be wise as serpents; "<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3616_1465065">341</A></SUP> while the play-actors may interfere with our
mentioning the harp in the book of Psalms. Let them therefore say, if they please, that, because
similitudes for the exhibition of the mysteries of God's word are taken from the things which I have
named, we are chargeable either with consulting the omens given by the flight of birds, or with
concocting the poisons of the charmer, or with taking pleasure in the excesses of the theatre,-a
statement which would be the clime of absurdity.</P>

<P>13. We do not forecast the issues of our enterprises by studying the sun and moon, and the times
of the year or of the month, lest in the most trying emergencies of life, we, being dashed against
the rocks of a wretched bondage, shall make shipwreck of our freedom of will; but with the most pious
devoutness of spirit, we accept similitudes adapted to the illustration of holy things, which these
heavenly bodies furnish, just as from all other works of creation, the winds, the sea, the land,
birds, fishes, cattle, trees, men, etc., we borrow in our discourses manifold figures; and in the
celebration of sacraments, the very few things which the comparative liberty of the Christian
dispensation has prescribed, such as water, bread, wine, and oil. Under the bondage, however, of the
ancient dispensation many rites were prescribed, which are made known to us only for our instruction
as to their meaning. We do not now observe years, and months, and seasons, lest the words of the
apostle apply to us, "I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon your labour in vain."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3618_1466645">342</A></SUP> For he blames those who say, "I will not set out
to-day, because it is an unlucky day, or because the moon is so and so;" or, "I will go to-day, that
things may prosper with me, because the position of the stars is this or that; I will do no business
this month, because a particular star rules it;" or, "I will do business, because another star has
succeeded in its place; I will not plant a vineyard this year, because it is leap year." No man of
ordinary sense would, however, suppose that those men deserve reproof for studying the seasons, who
say, <I>e.g.</I>, "I will not set out to-day, because a storm has begun;" or, "I will not put to sea,
because the winter is not yet past;" or, "It is time to sow my seed, for the earth has been saturated
with the showers of autumn;" and so on, in regard to any other natural effects of the motion and
moisture of the atmosphere which have been observed in connection with that consummately ordered
revolution of the heavenly bodies concerning which it was said when they were made, "Let them be for
signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3619_1467761">343</A></SUP> And in like .manner, whensoever illustrative
symbols are borrowed,. for the declaration of spiritual mysteries, from created things, not only from
the heaven and its orbs, but also from meaner creatures, this is done to give to the doctrine of
salvation an eloquence adapted to raise the affections of those who receive it from things seen,
corporeal and temporal, to things unseen, spiritual and eternal.</P>

<P>Chap. VIII.</P>

<P>14. None of us gives any consideration to the circumstance that, at the time at which we observe
Easter, the sun is in the Ram, as they call a certain region of the heavenly bodies, in which the sun
is, in fact, found at the beginning of the months; but whether they, choose to call that part of the
heavens the Ram: or anything else, we have learned this from the Sacred Scriptures, that God made all
the heavenly bodies, and appointed their places as it pleased Him; and whatever the parts may be into
which astronomers divide the regions set apart and ordained for the different constellations, and
whatever the names by which they distinguish them, the place occupied by the sun in the first month
is that in which the celebration of this sacrament behoved to find that luminary, because of the
illustration of a holy mystery in the renovation of life, of which I have already spoken
sufficiently. If, however, the name of Ram could be given to that portion of the heavenly bodies
because of some correspondence between their form and the name, the word of God would not hesitate to
borrow from anything of this kind an illustration of a holy mystery, as it has done not only from
other celestial bodies, but also from terrestrial things, <I>e.g.</I> from Orion and the Pleiades,
Mount Zion, Mount Sinai, and the rivers of which the names are given, Gihon, Pison, Tigris,
Euphrates, and particularly from the river Jordan, which is so often named in the sacred
mysteries.</P>

<P>15. But who can fail to perceive how great is the difference between useful observations of the
heavenly bodies in connection with the weather, such as farmers or sailors make; or in order to mark
the part of the world in which they are, and the course which they should follow, such as are made by
pilots of ships or men going through the trackless sandy deserts of southern Africa; or in order to
present some useful doctrine under a figure borrowed from some facts concerning heavenly bodies;-and
the vain hallucinations of men who observe the heavens not to know the weather, or their course, or
to make scientific calculations, or to find illustrations of spiritual things, but merely to pry into
the future and learn now what fate has decreed?</P>

<P>Chap. IX.</P>

<P>16. Let us now direct our minds to observe the reason why, in the celebration of Easter, care is
taken to appoint the day so: that Saturday precedes it: for this is peculiar to the Christian
religion. The Jews keep the Passover from the 14th to the 21st of the first month, on whatever day
that week begins. But since at the Passover at which the Lord suffered, it was the case that the
Jewish Sabbath came in between His death and His resurrection, our fathers have judged it right to
add this specialty to their celebration of Easter, both that our feast might be distinguished from
the Jewish Passover, and that succeeding generations might retain in their annual commemoration of
His Passion that which we must believe to have been done for some good reason, by Him who is before
the times, by whom also the times have been made, and who came in the fulness of the times, and who
when He said, Mine hour is not yet come, had the power of laying down His life and taking it again,
and was therefore waiting for an hour not fixed by blind fate, but suitable to the holy mystery which
He had resolved to commend to our observation.</P>

<P>17. That which we here hold in faith and hope, and to which by love we labour to come, is, as I
have said above, a certain holy and perpetual rest from the whole burden of every kind of care; and
from this life unto that rest we make a transition which our Lord Jesus Christ condescended to
exemplify and consecrate in His Passion. This rest, however, is not a slothful inaction, but a
certain ineffable tranquillity caused by work in which there is no painful effort. For the repose on
which one enters at the end of the toils of this life is of such a nature as consists with lively joy
in the active exercises of the better life. Forasmuch, however, as this activity is exercised in
praising God without bodily toil or mental anxiety, the transition to that activity is not made
through a repose which is to be followed by labour, <I>i.e.</I> a repose which, at the point where
activity begins, ceases to be repose: for in these exercises there is no return to toil and care; but
that which constitutes rest-namely, exemption from weariness in work and from uncertainty in
thought-is always found in them. Now, since through rest we get back to that original life which the
soul lost by sin, the emblem of this rest is the seventh day of the week. But that original life
itself which is restored to those who return from their wanderings, and receive in token of welcome
the robe which they had at first,<SUP><A HREF="#P3626_1472956">344</A></SUP> is
represented by t,h,e first day of the week, which we call the Lord's day. If, in reading Genesis, you
search the record of the seven days, you will find that there was no evening of the seventh day,
which signified that the rest of which it was a type was eternal. The life originally bestowed was
not eternal, because man sinned; but the final rest, of which the seventh day was an emblem, its
eternal, and hence the eighth day also will have eternal blessedness, because that rest, being
eternal, is taken up by the eighth day, not destoyed by it; for if it were thus destroyed, it would
not be eternal. Accordingly the eighth day, which is the first day of the week, represents to us that
original life, not taken away, but made eternal.</P>

<P>Chap. X.</P>

<P>18. Nevertheless the seventh day was appointed to the Jewish nation as a day to be observed by
rest of the body, that it might be a type of sanctification to which men attain through rest in the
Holy Spirit. We do no read of sanctification in the history given in Genesis of all the earlier days:
of the Sabbath alone it is said that "God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3629_1474114">345</A></SUP> Now the souls of men, whether good or bad, love
rest, but how to attain to that which they love is to the greater part unknown: and that which bodies
seek for their weight, is precisely what souls seek for their love, namely, a resting-place. For as,
according to its specific gravity, a body descends or rises until it reaches a place where it can
rest,-oil, for example, falling if poured into the air, but rising if poured into water,-so the soul
of man struggles towards the things which it loves, in order that, by reaching them, it may rest.
There are indeed many things which please the soul through the body, but its rest in these is not
eternal, nor even long continued; and therefore they rather debase the soul and weigh it down, so as
to be a drag upon that pure imponderability by which it tends towards higher things. When the soul
finds pleasure from itself, it is not yet seeking delight in that which is unchangeable; and
therefore it is still proud, because it is giving to itself the highest place, whereas God is higher.
In such sin the soul is not left unpunished, for "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the
humble."<SUP><A HREF="#P3630_1475283">346</A></SUP> When, however, the soul delights
in God, there it finds the true, sure, and eternal rest, which in all other objects was sought in
vain. Therefore the admonition is given in the book of Psalms, "Delight thyself in the Lord, and He
shall give thee the desires of thine heart."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3631_1475579">347</A></SUP> </P>

<P>19. Because, therefore, "the love of God<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3633_1475643">348</A></SUP> is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit
which is given to us,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3634_1475830">349</A></SUP> sanctification was
associated with the seventh day, the day in which rest was enjoined. But inasmuch as we neither are
able to do any good work, except as helped by the gift of God, as the apostle says, "For it is God
that worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3635_1476132">350</A></SUP> nor will be able to rest, after all the good
works which engage us in this life, except as sanctified and perfected by the same gift to eternity;
for this reason it is said of God Himself, that when He had made all things "very good," He rested
"on the seventh day from all His works which He had made?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3636_1476456">351</A></SUP> For He, in so doing, presented a type of that
future rest which He purposed to bestow on us men after our good works are done; For as in our good
works He is said to work in us, by whose gift we are enabled to work what is good, so in our rest He
is said to rest by whose gift we rest.</P>

<P>Chap. XI.</P>

<P>20. This, moreover, is the reason why the law of the Sabbath is placed third among the three
commandments of the Decalogue which declare our duty to God (for the other seven relate to our
neighbour, that is, to man; the whole law hanging on these two commandments).<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3639_1477043">352</A></SUP> The first commandment, in which we are forbidden
to worship any likeness of God made by human contrivance, we are to understand as referring to the
Father: this prohibition being made, not because God has no image, but because no image of Him but
that One which is the same with Himself, ought to be worshipped; and this One not in His stead, but
along with Him. Then, because a creature is mutable, and therefore it is said, "The whole creation is
subject to vanity,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3640_1477536">353</A></SUP> since the nature of
the whole is manifested also in any part of it, lest any one should think that the Son of God, the
Word by whom all things were made, is a creature, the second commandment is, "Thou shalt not take the
name of the Lord thy God in vain."<SUP><A HREF="#P3641_1477815">354</A></SUP> And
because God sanctified the seventh day, on which He rested, the Holy Spirit-in whom is given to us
that rest which we love everywhere, but find only in loving God, when "His love is shed abroad in us,
by the Holy Ghost given unto us"<SUP><A HREF="#P3642_1478085">355</A></SUP> -is
presented to our minds in the third commandment, which was written concerning the observance of the
Sabbath, not to make us suppose that we attain to rest in this present life, but that all our labours
in what is good may point towards nothing else than that eternal rest. For I would specially charge
you to remember the passage quoted above: "We are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not
hope.<SUP><A HREF="#P3643_1478509">356</A></SUP> </P>

<P>21. For the feeding and fanning of that ardent love by which, under a law like that of
gravitation, we are borne upwards or inwards to rest, the presentation of truth by emblems has a
great power: for, thus presented, things move and kindle our affection much more than if they were
set forth in bald statements, not clothed with sacramental symbols. Why this should be, it is hard to
say; but it is the fact that anything which we are taught by allegory or emblem affects and pleases
us more, and is more highly esteemed by us, than it would be if most clearly stated in plain terms. I
believe that the emotions are less easily kindled while the soul is wholly involved in earthly
things; but if it be brought to those corporeal things which are emblems of spiritual things, and
then taken from these to the spiritual realities which they represent, it gathers strength by the
mere act of passing from the one to the other, and, like the flame of a lighted torch, is made by the
motion to burn more brightly, and is carried away to rest by a more intensely glowing love.</P>

<P>Chap. XII.</P>

<P>22. It is also for this reason, that of all the ten commandments, that which related to the
Sabbath was the only one in which the thing commanded was typical;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3647_1479772">357</A></SUP> the bodily rest enjoined being a type which we
have received as a means of our instruction, but not as a duty binding also upon us. For while in the
Sabbath a figure is presented of the spiritual, rest, of which it is said in the Psalm, "Be still,
and know that I am God,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3648_1480087">358</A></SUP> and unto which
men I are invited by the Lord Himself in the words, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in
heart: so shall ye find rest unto your souls; "<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3649_1480371">359</A></SUP> as to all the things enjoined in the other
commandments, we are to yield to them an obedience in which there is nothing typical. For we have
been taught literally not to worship idols; and the precepts enjoining us not to take God's name in
vain, to honour our father and mother, not to commit adultery, or kill, or steal, or bear false
witness, or covet our neighbour's wife, or covet anything that is our neighbour's,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3650_1480816">360</A></SUP> are all devoid of typical or mystical meaning,
and are to be literally observed. But we are not commanded to observe the day of the Sabbath
literally, in resting from bodily labour, as it is observed by the Jews; and even their observance of
the rest as prescribed is to be deemed worthy of contempt, except as signifying another, namely,
spiritual rest. From this we may reasonably conclude, that all those things which are figuratively
set forth in Scripture, are powerful in stimulating that love by which we tend towards rest; since
the only figurative or typical precept in the Decalogue is the one in which that rest is commended to
us, which is desired everywhere, but is found sure and sacred in God alone.</P>

<P>Chap. XIII.</P>

<P>23. The Lord's day, however, has been made known not to the Jews, but to Christians, by the
resurrection of the Lord, and from Him it began to have the festive character which is proper to
it.<SUP><A HREF="#P3653_1481770">361</A></SUP> For the souls of the pious dead are,
indeed, in a state of repose before the resurrection of the body, but they are not engaged in the
same active exercises as shall engage the strength of their bodies when restored. Now, of this
condition of active exercise the eighth day (which is also the first of the week) is a type, because
it does not put an end to that repose, but glorifies it. For with the reunion of the body no
hindrance of the soul's rest returns, because in the restored body there is no corruption: for "this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3654_1482423">362</A></SUP> Wherefore, although the sacramental import of
the 8th number, as signifying the resurrection, was by no means concealed from the holy men of old
who were filled with the spirit of prophecy (for in the title of Psalms [vi. and xii.] we find the
words "for the eighth," and infants were circumcised on the eighth day; and in Ecclesiastes it is
said, with allusion to the two covenants, "Give a portion to seven, and also to eight"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3655_1482874">363</A></SUP> ); nevertheless before the resurrection of the
Lord, it was reserved and hidden, and the Sabbath alone was appointed to be observed, because before
that event there was indeed the, repose of the dead (of which the Sabbath rest was a type), but there
was not any instance of the resurrection of one who, rising from the dead, was no more to die, and
over whom death should no longer have dominion; this being done in order that, from the time when
such a resurrection did take place in the Lord's own body (the Head of the Church being the first to
experience that which His body, the Church, expects at the end of time), the day upon which He rose,
the eighth day namely (which is the same with the first of the week), should begin to be observed as
the Lord's day. The same reason enables us to understand why, in regard to the day of keeping the
passover, on which the Jews were commanded to kill and eat a lamb, which was most clearly a
foreshadowing of the Lord's Passion, there was no injunction given to them that they should take the
day of the week into account, waiting until the Sabbath was past, and making the beginning of the
third week of the moon coincide with the beginning of the third week of the first month; the reason
being, that the Lord might rather in His own Passion declare the significance of that day, as He had
come also to declare the mystery of the day now known as the Lord's day, the eighth namely, which is
also the first of the week.</P>

<P>Chap. XIV.</P>

<P>24. Consider now with attention these three most sacred days, the days signalized by the Lord's
crucifixion, rest in the grave, and resurrection. Of these three, that of which the cross is the
symbol is the business of our present life: those things which are symbolized by His rest in the
grave and His resurrection we hold by faith and hope. For <I>now</I> the command is given to each
man, "Take up thy cross, and follow me."<SUP><A HREF="#P3658_1484854">364</A></SUP>
But the flesh is crucified, when our members which are upon the earth are mortified, such as
fornication, uncleanness, luxury, avarice, etc., of which the apostle says in another passage: "If ye
live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
shall live."<SUP><A HREF="#P3659_1485187">365</A></SUP> Hence also he says of
himself: "The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3660_1485297">366</A></SUP> And again: "Knowing this, that our old man is
crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
sin."<SUP><A HREF="#P3661_1485466">367</A></SUP> The period during which our labours
tend to the weakening and destruction of the body of sin, during which the outward man is perishing,
that the inward man may be renewed day by day,-that is the period of the cross.</P>

<P>25. These are, it is true, good works, having rest for their recompense, but they are meanwhile
laborious and painful: therefore we are told to be "rejoicing in hope," that while we contemplate the
future rest, we may labour with cheerfulness in present toil. Of this cheerfulness the breadth of the
cross in the transverse beam to which the hands were nailed is an emblem: for the hands we understand
to be symbolical of working, and the breadth to be symbolical of cheerfulness in him who works, for
sadness straitens the spirit. In the height of the cross, against which the head is placed, we have
an emblem of the expectation of recompense from the sublime justice of God, "who will render to every
man according to his deeds; to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and
honour, and immortality, eternal life."<SUP><A HREF="#P3663_1486544">368</A></SUP>
Therefore the length of the cross, along which the whole body is extended, is an emblem of that
patient continuance in the will of God, on account of which those who are patient are said to be
long-suffering. The depth also, <I>i.e.</I> the part which is fixed in the ground, represents the
occult nature of the holy mystery. For you remember, I suppose, the words of the apostle, which in
this description of the cross I aim at expounding: "That ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may
be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3664_1487145">369</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Those things which we do not yet see or possess, but hold in faith and hope, are the things
represented in the events by which the second and third of the three memorable days above mentioned
were signalized [viz. the Lord's rest in the .grave, and His resurrection]. But the things which keep
us occupied in this present life, while we are held fast in the fear of God by the commandments, as
by nails driven through the flesh (as it is written, "Make my flesh fast with nails by fear of Thee
"<SUP><A HREF="#P3666_1487666">370</A></SUP> ), are to be reckoned among things
necessary, not among those which are for their own sakes to be desired and coveted. Hence Paul says
that he desired, as something far better, to depart and to be with Christ: "nevertheless," he adds,
"to remain in the flesh is expedient for you"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3667_1488039">371</A></SUP> -necessary for your welfare. This departing and
being with Christ is the beginning of the rest which is not interrupted, but glorified by the
resurrection; and this rest is now enjoyed by faith, "for the just shall live by faith."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3668_1488295">372</A></SUP> "Know ye not," saith the same apostle, "that so
many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death? Therefore we are buried
with Him by baptism unto death."<SUP><A HREF="#P3669_1488497">373</A></SUP> How? By
faith. For this is not actually completed in us so long as we are still "groaning within ourselves,
and waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body: for we are saved by hope; but hope
that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we
see not, then do we with patience wait for it."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3670_1488877">374</A></SUP> </P>

<P>26. Remember how often I repeat this to you, that we are not to think that we ought to be made
happy and free from all difficulties in this present life, and are therefore at liberty to murmur
profanely against God when we are straitened in the things of this world, as if He were not
performing what He promised. He hath indeed promised the things which are necessary for this life,
but the consolations which mitigate the misery of our present lot are very different from the joys of
those who are perfect in blessedness. "In the multitude of my thoughts within me," saith the
believer, "Thy comforts, O Lord, delight my soul."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3672_1489534">375</A></SUP> Let us not therefore murmur because of
difficulties; let us not lose that breadth of cheerfulness, of which it is written, "Rejoicing in
hope," because this follows,-"patient in tribulation."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3673_1489748">376</A></SUP> The new life, therefore, is meanwhile begun in
faith, and maintained by hope: for it shall only then be perfect when this mortal shall be swallowed
up. in life, and death swallowed up in victory; when the last enemy, death, shah be destroyed; when
we shall be changed, and made like the angels: for "we shall all rise again, but we shah not all be
changed."<SUP><A HREF="#P3674_1490128">377</A></SUP> Again, the Lord saith, "They
shall! be equal unto the angels."<SUP><A HREF="#P3675_1490330">378</A></SUP> We now
are apprehended by Him in fear by faith: then we shall apprehend Him in love by sight. For "whilst we
are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, not by sight."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3676_1490551">379</A></SUP> Hence the apostle himself, who says, "I follow
after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus," confesses
frankly that he has not attained to it. "Brethren," he says, "I count not myself to have
apprehended."<SUP><A HREF="#P3677_1490821">380</A></SUP> Since, however, our hope is
sure, because of the truth of the promise, when he said elsewhere, "Therefore we are buried with Him
by baptism into death," he adds these words, "that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3678_1491148">381</A></SUP> We walk, therefore, in actual labour, but in
hope of rest, in the flesh of the old life, but in faith of the new. For he says again: "The body is
dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken
your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you."</P>

<P>27. Both the authority of the Divine Scriptures and the consent of the whole Church spread
throughout the world have combined to ordain the annual commemoration of these things at Easter, by
observances which are, as you now see, full of spiritual significance. From the Old Testament
Scriptures we are not taught as to the precise day of holding Easter, beyond the limitation to the
period between the 14th and 21st days of the first month; but because we know from the Gospel beyond
doubt which days of the week were signalized in succession by the Lord's crucifixion, His resting in
the grave, and His resurrection, the observance of these days has been enjoined in addition by
Councils of the Fathers, and the whole Christian world has arrived unanimously at the persuasion that
this is the proper mode of observing Easter.</P>

<P>Chap. XV.</P>

<P>28.<SUP><A HREF="#P3682_1492410">382</A></SUP> The Fast of Forty Days has its
warrant both in the Old Testament, from the fasting of Moses<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3683_1492777">383</A></SUP> and of Elijah,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3684_1492815">384</A></SUP> and in the Gospel from the fact that our Lord
fasted the same number of days;<SUP><A HREF="#P3685_1492917">385</A></SUP> proving
thereby that the Gospel is not at variance with the Law and the Prophets. For the Law and the
Prophets are represented in the persons of Moses and Elijah respectively; between whom also He
appeared in glory on the Mount, that what the apostle says of Him, that He is "witnessed unto both by
the Law and the Prophets,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3686_1493263">386</A></SUP> might be made
more clearly manifest. Now, in what part of the year could the observance of the Fast of Forty Days
be more appropriately placed, than in that which immediately precedes and borderson the time of the
Lord's Passion? For by it is signified this life of toil, the chief work in which is to exercise
self-control, in abstaining from the world's friendship, which never ceases deceitfully caressing us,
and scattering profusely around us its bewitching allurements. As to the reason why this life of toil
and self-control is symbolized by the number 40, it seems to me that the number ten (in which is the
perfection of our blessedness, as in the number eight, because it returns to the unit) has a like
place in this number [as the unit has in giving its significance to eight];<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3687_1494075">387</A></SUP> and therefore I regard the number forty as a fit
symbol for this life, because in it the creature (of which the symbolical number is seven) cleaves to
the Creator, in whom is revealed that unity of the Trinity which is to be published while time lasts
throughout this whole world,-a world swept by four winds, constituted of four elements, and
experiencing the changes of four seasons in the year. Now four times ten [seven added to three] are
forty; but the number forty reckoned in along with [one of] its parts adds the number ten, [as seven
reckoned in along with one of its parts adds the unit,] and the total is fifty,-the symbol, as it
were, of the reward of the toil and self-control.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3688_1494865">388</A></SUP> For it is not without reason that the Lord
Himself con!tinned for forty days on this earth and in this life in fellowship with His disciples
after His resurrection, and, when He ascended into heaven, sent the promised Holy Spirit, after an
interval of ten days more, when the day of Pentecost was fully come. This fiftieth day, moreover, has
wrapped up in it another holy mystery:<SUP><A HREF="#P3689_1495945">389</A></SUP>
for 7 times 7 days are 49. And when we return to the beginning of another seven, and add the eighth,
which is also the first day of the week, we have the 50 days complete; which period of fifty days we
celebrate after the Lord's resurrection, as representing not toil, but rest and gladness. For this
reason we do not fast in them; and in praying we stand upright, which is an emblem of resurrection.
Hence, also, every Lord's day during the fifty days, this usage is observed at the altar, and the
Alleluia is sung, which signifies that our future exercise shall consist wholly in praising God, as
it is written: "Blessed are they who dwell in Thy house, O Lord: they will be still (<I>i.e.</I>
eternally) praising Thee."<SUP><A HREF="#P3690_1496682">390</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Chap. XVI.</P>

<P>29. The fiftieth day is also commended to us in Scripture; and not only in the Gospel, by the fact
that on that day the Holy Spirit descended, but also in the books of the Old Testament. For in them
we learn, that after the Jews observed the first passover with the slaying of the lamb as appointed,
50 days intervened between that day and the day on which upon Mount Sinai there was given to Moses
the Law written with the finger of God;<SUP><A HREF="#P3693_1497153">391</A></SUP>
and this "finger of God" is in the Gospels most plainly declared to signify the Holy Spirit: for
where one evangelist quotes our Lord's words thus, "I with the finger of God cast out devils,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3694_1497376">392</A></SUP> another quotes them thus, "I cast out devils by
the Spirit of God."<SUP><A HREF="#P3695_1497464">393</A></SUP> Who would not prefer
the joy which these divine mysteries impart, when the light of healing truth beams from them on the
soul to all the kingdoms of this world, even though these were held in perfect prosperity and peace?
May we not say, that as the two seraphim answer each other in singing the praise of the Most High,
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hosts,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3696_1497852">394</A></SUP> so the Old Testament and the New, in perfect
harmony, give forth their testimony to sacred truth? The lamb is slain, the passover is celebrated,
and after 50 days the Law is given, which inspires fear, written by the finger of God. Christ is
slain, being led as a lamb to the slaughter as Isaiah testifies;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3697_1498179">395</A></SUP> the true Passover is celebrated; and after 5
days is given the Holy Spirit, who is the finger of God, and whose fruit is love, and who is
therefore opposed to men who seek their own, and consequently bear a grievous yoke and heavy burden,
and find no, rest for their souls; for love "seeketh not her own."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3698_1498507">396</A></SUP> Therefore there is no rest in the unloving
spirit of heretics, whom the apostle declares guilty of conduct like that of the magicians of
Pharaoh, saying, "Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men
of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly
shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3699_1498920">397</A></SUP> For because through this corruptness of mind
they were utterly disquieted, they failed at the third miracle, confessing that the Spirit of God
which was in Moses was opposed to them: for in owning their failure, they said, "This is the finger
of God."<SUP><A HREF="#P3700_1499195">398</A></SUP> The Holy Spirit, who shows
Himself reconciled and gracious to the meek and lowly in heart, and gives them rest, shows Himself an
inexorable adversary to the proud and haughty, and vexes them with disquiet. Of this disquiet those
despicable insects were a figure, under which Pharaoh's magicians owned themselves foiled, saying,
"This is the finger of God."</P>

<P>30. Read the book of Exodus, and observe the number of days between the first passover and the
giving of the Law. God speaks to Moses in the desert of Sinai on the first day of the third month.
Mark, then, this as one day of the month, and then observe what (among other things) the Lord said on
that day: "Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes,
and be ready against the third day; for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the
people upon Mount Sinai."<SUP><A HREF="#P3702_1500099">399</A></SUP> The Law was
accordingly given on the third day of the month. Now reckon the days between the 14th day of the
first month, the day of the passover, and the 3d day of the third month, and you have 17 days of the
first month, 30 of the second, and 3 of the third-50 in all. The Law in the Ark of the Testimony
represents holiness in the Lord's body, by whose resurrection is promised to us the future rest; for
our receiving of which, love is breathed into us by the Holy Spirit. But the Spirit had not then been
given, for Jesus had not yet been glorified.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3703_1500679">400</A></SUP> Hence that prophetic song, "Arise, O Lord, into
Thy rest, Thou and the ark of Thy strength" [holiness, LXX.].<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3704_1500811">401</A></SUP> Where there is rest, there is holiness.
Wherefore we have now received a pledge of it, that we may love and desire it. For to the rest
belonging to the other life, whereunto we are brought by that transition from this life of which the
passover is a symbol, all are now invited in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit.</P>

<P>Chap. XVII.</P>

<P>31. Hence also, in the number of the large fishes which our Lord after His resurrection, showing
this new life, commanded to be taken on the right side of the ship, there is found the number 50
three times multiplied, with the addition of three more [the symbol of the Trinity] to make the holy
mystery more apparent; and the disciples' nets were not broken,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3707_1501538">402</A></SUP> because in that new life there shall be no
schism caused by the disquiet of heretics. Then [in this new life] man, made perfect and at rest,
purified in body and in soul by the pure words of God, which are like silver purged from its dross,
seven times refined,<SUP><A HREF="#P3708_1501827">403</A></SUP> shall receive his
reward, the denarius;<SUP><A HREF="#P3709_1501886">404</A></SUP> so that with that
reward the numbers 10 and 7 meet in him. For in this number [17] there is found, as in other numbers
representing a combination of symbols, a wonderful mystery. Nor is it without good reason that the
seventeenth Psalm<SUP><A HREF="#P3710_1502146">405</A></SUP> is the only one which
is given complete in the book of Kings,<SUP><A HREF="#P3711_1502252">406</A></SUP>
because it signifies that kingdom in which we shall have no enemy. For its title is, "A Psalm of
David, in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of
Saul." For of whom is David the type, but of Him who, according to the flesh, was born of the seed of
David?<SUP><A HREF="#P3712_1502646">407</A></SUP> He in His Church, that is, in His
body, still endures the malice of enemies. Therefore the words which from heaven fell upon the ear of
that persecutor whom Jesus slew by His voice, and whom He transformed into a part of His body (as the
food which we use becomes a part of ourselves), were these, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
Me?"<SUP><A HREF="#P3713_1503002">408</A></SUP> And when shall this His body be
finally delivered from enemies? Is it not when the last enemy, Death, shall be destroyed? It is to
that time that the number of the 153 fishes pertains. For if the number 17 itself be the side of an
arithmetical triangle,<SUP><A HREF="#P3714_1503275">409</A></SUP> formed by placing
above each other rows of units, increasing in number from 1 to 17, the whole sum of these units is
153: since 1 and 2 make 3; 3 and 3, 6; 6 and 4, 10; 10 and 5, 15; 15 and 6, 21; and so on: continue
this up to 17, the total is 153.</P>

<P>32. The celebration of Easter and Pentecost is therefore most firmly based on Scripture. As to the
observance of the forty days before Easter, this has been confirmed by the practice of the Church; as
also the separation of the eight days of the neophytes, in such order that. the eighth of these
coincides with the first. The custom of singing the Alleluia on those 50 days only in the Church is
not universal; for in other places it is sung also at various other times, but on these days it is
sung everywhere. Whether the custom of standing at prayer on these days and on all the Lord's days,
is everywhere observed or not, I do not know; nevertheless, I have told you what guides the Church in
this usage, and it is in my opinion sufficiently obvious.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3716_1504314">410</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Chap. XVIII.</P>

<P>33. As to the feet-washing, since the Lord recommended this because of its being an example of
that humility which He came to teach, as He Himself afterwards explained, the question has arisen at
what time it is best, by literal performance of this work, to give public instruction in the
important duty which it illustrates, and this time [of Lent] was suggested in order that the lesson
taught by it might make a deeper and more serious impression. Many, however, have not accepted this
as a custom, lest it should be thought to belong to the ordinance of baptism; and some have not
hesitated to deny it any place among our ceremonies. Some, however, in order to connect its
observance with the more sacred associations of this solemn season, and at the same time to prevent
its being confounded with baptism in any way, have selected for this ceremony either the eighth day
itself, or that on which the third eighth day occurs, because of the great significance of the number
three in many holy mysteries.</P>

<P>34. I am surprised at your expressing a desire that I should write anything in regard to those
ceremonies which are found different in different countries, because there is no necessity for my
doing this; and, moreover, one most excellent rule must be observed in regard to these customs, when
they do not in any way oppose either true doctrine or sound morality, but contain some incentives to
the better life, viz., that wherever we see them observed, or know them to be established, we should
not only refrain from finding fault with them, but even recommend them by our approval and imitation,
unless restrained by fear of doing greater harm than good by this course, through the infirmity of
others. We are not, however, to be restrained by this, if more good is to be expected from our
consenting with those who are zealous for the ceremony, than loss to be feared from our displeasing
those who protest against it. In such a case we ought by all means to adopt it, especially if it be
something in defence of which Scripture can be alleged: as in the singing of hymns and psalms, for
which we have on record both the example and the precepts of the Lord and of His apostles. In this
religious exercise, so useful for inducing a devotional frame of mind and inflaming the strength of
love to God, there is diversity of usage, and in Africa the members of the Church are rather too
indifferent in regard to it; on which account the Donstists reproach us with our grave chanting of
the divine songs of the prophets in our churches, while they inflame their passions in their revels
by the singing of psalms of human composition, which rouse them like the stirring notes of the
trumpet on the battle-field. But when brethren are assembled in the church, why should not the time
be devoted to singing of sacred songs, excepting of course while reading or preaching<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3720_1507293">411</A></SUP> is going on, or while the presiding minister
prays aloud, or the united prayer of the congregation is led by the deacon's voice? At the other
intervals not thus occupied, I do not see what could be a more excellent, useful, and holy exercise
for a Christian congregation.</P>

<P>Chap. XIX.<SUP><A HREF="#P3722_1507679">412</A></SUP> </P>

<P>35. I cannot, however, sanction with my approbation those ceremonies which are departures from the
custom of the Church, and are instituted on the pretext of being symbolical of some holy mystery;
although, for the sake of avoiding offence to the piety of some and the pugnacity of others, I do not
venture to condemn severely many things of this kind. But this I deplore, and have too much occasion
to do so, that comparatively little attention is paid to many of the most wholesome rites which
Scripture has enjoined; and that so many false notions everywhere prevail, that more severe rebuke
would be administered to a man who should touch the ground with his feet bare during the octaves
(before his baptism), than to one who drowned his intellect I in drunkenness. My opinion therefore
is, that wherever it is possible, all those things should be abolished without hesitation, which
neither have warrant in Holy Scripture, nor are found to have been appointed by councils of bishops,
nor are confirmed by the practice of the universal Church, but are so infinitely various, according
to the different customs of different places, that it is with difficulty, if at all, that the reasons
which guided men in appointing them can be discovered. For even although nothing be found, perhaps,
in which they are against the true faith; yet the Christian religion, which God in His mercy made
free, appointing to her sacraments very few in number, and very easily observed, is by these
burdensome ceremonies so oppressed, that the condition of the Jewish Church itself is preferable: for
although they have not known the time of their freedom, they are subjected to burdens imposed by the
law of God, not by the vain conceits of men. The Church of God, however, being meanwhile so
constituted as to enclose much chaff and many tares, bears with many things; yet if anything be
contrary to faith or to holy life, she does not approve of it either by silence or by practice.</P>

<P>Chap. XX.</P>

<P>36. Accordingly, that which you wrote as to certain brethren abstaining from the use of animal
food, on the ground of its being ceremonially unclean, is most clearly contrary to the faith and to
sound doctrine. If I were to enter on anything like a full discussion of this matter, it might be
thought by some that there was some obscurity in the precepts of the apostle in this matter whereas
he, among many other things which he said on this subject, expressed his abhorrence of this opinion
of the heretics in these words: "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils; speaking lies
in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to
abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and
know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with
thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3726_1510921">413</A></SUP> Again, in another place, he says, concerning
these things: "Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is
nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3727_1511151">414</A></SUP> Read the rest for yourself, and read these
passages to others-to as many as you can-in order that, seeing that they have been called to liberty,
they may not make void the grace of God toward them; only let them not use their liberty for an
occasion to serve the flesh: let them not refuse to practise the purpose of curbing carnal appetite,
abstinence from some kinds of food, on the pretext that it is unlawful to do so under the promptings
of superstition or unbelief.</P>

<P>37. As to those who read futurity by taking at random a text from the pages of the Gospels,
although it is better that they should do this than go to consult spirits of divination, nevertheless
it is, in my opinion, a censurable practice to try to turn to secular affairs and the vanity of this
life those divine oracles which were intended to teach us concerning the higher life.</P>

<P>Chap. XXI.</P>

<P>38. If you do not consider that I have now written enough in answer to your questions, you must
have little knowledge of my capacities or of my engagements. For so far am I from being, as you have
thought, acquainted with everything, that I read nothing in your letter with more sadness than this
statement, both because it is most manifestly untrue, and because I am surprised that you should not!
be aware, that not only are many things unknown to me in countless other departments, but that even
in the Scriptures themselves the things which I do not know are many more than the things which I
know. But I cherish a hope in the name of Christ, which is not without its reward, because I have not
only believed the testimony of my God that "on these two commandments hang all the Law and the
Prophets;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3731_1512837">415</A></SUP> but I have myself proved it,
and daily prove it, by experience. For there is no holy mystery, and no difficult passage of the word
of God, in which, when it is opened up to me, I do not find these same commandments: for "the end of
the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith
unfeigned;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3732_1513193">416</A></SUP> and "love is the fulfilling
of the law."<SUP><A HREF="#P3733_1513254">417</A></SUP> </P>

<P>39. I beseech you therefore also, my dearly beloved, whether studying these or other writings, so
to read and so to learn as to bear in mind what hath been most truly said, "Knowledge puffeth up, but
charity edifieth;"<SUP><A HREF="#P3735_1513496">418</A></SUP> but charity vaunteth
not itself, is not puffed up. Let knowledge therefore be used as a kind of scaffolding by which may
be erected the building of charity, which shall endure for ever when knowledge faileth.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3736_1513729">419</A></SUP> Knowledge, if applied as a means to charity, is
most useful; but apart from this high end, it has been proved not only superfluous, but even
pernicious. I know, however, how holy meditation keeps you safe under the shadow of the wings of our
God. These things I have stated, though briefly, because I know that this same charity of yours,
which "vaunteth not itself," will prompt you to lend and read this letter to many.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Noble and Worthy Lord Pammachius, My Son, Dearly Beloved in the Bowels of Christ,
Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. The good works which spring from the grace of Christ in you have given you a claim to be
esteemed by us His members, and have made you as truly known and as much beloved by us as you could
be. For even were I daily seeing your face, this could add nothing to the completeness of the
acquaintance with you which I now have, when in the shining light of one of your actions I have seen
your inner being, fair with the loveliness of peace, and beaming with the brightness of truth. Seeing
this has made me know you, and knowing you has made me love you; and therefore, in addressing you, I
write to one who, notwithstanding our distance from each other, has become known to me, and is my
beloved friend. The bond which binds us together is indeed of earlier date, and we were living united
under One Head: for had you not been rooted in His love, the Catholic unity would not have been so
dear to you, and you would not have dealt as you have done with your African tenants<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3745_1515471">420</A></SUP> settled in the midst of the consular province of
Numidia, the very country in which the folly of the Donatists began, addressing them in such terms,
and encouraging them with such enthusiasm, as to persuade them with unhesitating devotion to choose
that course which they believed that a man of your character and position would not adopt on other
grounds than truth ascertained and acknowledged, and to submit themselves, though so remote from you,
to the same Head; so that along with yourself they are reckoned for ever as members of Him by whose
command they are for the time dependent upon you.</P>

<P>2. Embracing you, therefore, as known to me by this transaction, I am moved by joyful feelings to
congratulate you in Christ Jesus our Lord, .and to send you this letter as a proof of my heart's love
towards you; for I cannot do more. I beseech you, however, not to measure the amount of my love by
this letter; but by means of this letter, when you have read it, pass on by the unseen inner passage
which thought I opens up into my heart, and see what is there felt towards you. For to the eye of
love that sanctuary of love shall be unveiled which we shut against the disquieting trifles of this
world when there we worship God; and there you will see the ecstasy of my joy in your good work,an
ecstasy which I cannot describe with tongue for pen, glowing and burning in the offering of praise to
Him by whose inspiration you were made willing, and by whose help you were made able to serve Him in
this way. "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift!"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3747_1517043">421</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3. Oh how we desire in Africa to see such work as this by which you have gladdened us [done by
many, who are, like yourself, senators in the State, and sons of the holy Church! It is, however,
hazardous to give them this exhortation: they may refuse to follow it, and the enemies of the Church
will take advantage of this to deceive the weak, as if they had gained a victory over us in the minds
of those who disregarded our counsel. But it is safe for me to express gratitude to you; for you have
already done that by which, in the emancipation of those who were weak, the enemies of the Church are
confounded. I have therefore thought it sufficient to ask you to read this letter with friendly
boldness to any to whom you can do so on the ground of their Christian profession. For thus learning
what you have achieved, they will believe that that, about which as an impossibility they are now
indifferent, can be done in Africa. As to the snares which these heretics contrive in the perversity
of their hearts, I have resolved not to speak of them in this letter, because I have been only amused
at their imagining that they could gain any advantage over your mind, which Christ holds as His
possession. You will hear them, however, from my brethren, whom I earnestly commend to your
Excellency: they fear lest you should disdain some things which to you might seem unnecessary in
connection with the great and unlooked for salvation of those men over whom, in consequence of your
work, their Catholic Mother rejoices.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Most Blessed Lord and Venerable Father Victorinus, My Brother in the Priesthood,
Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Your summons to the Council reached me on the fifth day before the Ides of November, in
the evening, and found me very much indisposed, so that I could not possibly attend. However, I
submit to your pious and wise judgment whether certain perplexities which the summons occasioned were
due to my own ignorance or to sufficient grounds. I read in that summons that it was written also to
the districts of Mauritania, which, as we know, have their own primates. Now, if these provinces were
to be represented in a Council held in Numidia, it was by all means proper that the names of some of
the more eminent bishops who are in Mauritania should be attached to the circular letter; and not
finding this, I have been greatly surprised. Moreover, to the bishops of Numidia it has been
addressed in such a confused and careless manner, that my own name I find in the third place,
although I know my proper order to be much further down in the roll of bishops. This wrongs others,
and grieves me. Moreover, our venerable father and colleague, Xantippus of Tagosa, says that the
primacy belongs to him, and by very many he is regarded as the primate, and he issues such letters as
you have sent. Even supposing that this be a mistake, which your Holiness can easily discover and
correct, certainly his name should not have been omitted in the summons which you have issued. If his
name had been placed in the middle of the list, and not in the first line, I would have wondered
much; how much greater, then, is my surprise, when I find in it no mention whatever made of him who,
above all others, behoved to be present in the Council, that by the bishops of all the Numidian
churches this question of the order of the primacy might be debated before any other!</P>

<P>2. For these reasons, I might even hesitate to come to the Council, lest the summons in which so
many flagrant mistakes are found should be a forgery; even were I not hindered both by the!shortness
of the notice, and manifold other important engagements standing in the way, I therefore beg you,
most blessed prelate, to excuse me, and to be pleased to give attention, in the first instance, to
bring about between your Holiness and the aged Xantippus a cordial mutual understanding as to the
question which of you ought to summon the Council; or at least, as I think would be still better, let
both of you, without prejudging the claim of either, conjointly call together our colleagues,
especially those who have been nearly as long in the episcopate as yourselves, who may easily
discover land decide which of you has truth on his side,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3755_1521327">422</A></SUP> that this question may be settled first among a
few of you; and then, when the mistake has been rectified, let the younger bishops be gathered
together, who, having no others whom it would be either possible or right for them to accept as
witnesses in this matter but yourselves, are meanwhile at a loss to know to which of you the
preference is to be given.</P>

My Brother in the Priesthood, Most Sincerely Beloved, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I have received no letter from your Holiness since we parted; but I have now read a letter
of your Grace concerning Donatus and his brother, and I have long hesitated as to the reply which I
ought to give. After frequently reconsidering what is in such a case conducive to the welfare of
those whom we serve in Christ, and seek to nourish in Him, nothing has occurred to me which would
alter my opinion that: it is not right to give occasion for God's servants to think that promotion to
a better position is more readily given to those who have become worse. Such a rule would make monks
less careful of falling, and a most grievous wrong would be done to the order of clergy, if those who
have deserted their duty as monks be chosen to serve as clergy, seeing that our custom is to select
for that office only the more tried and superior men of those who continue faithful to their calling
as monks; unless, perchance, the common people are to be taught to joke at our expense, saying "a bad
monk make: a good clerk," as they are wont to say that "a poor flute-player makes a good singer." It
would be an intolerable calamity if we were to encourage the monks to such fatal pride, and were to
consent to brand with so grievous disgrace the clerical order to which we ourselves belong: seeing
that sometimes even a good monk is scarcely qualified to be a good clerk; for though he be proficient
in self-denial, he may lack the necessary instruction, or be disqualified by some personal
defect.</P>

<P>2. I believe, however, that your Holiness understood these monks to have left the monastery with
my consent, in order that they might rather be useful to the people of their own district; but this
was not the case: of their own accord they departed, of their own accord they deserted us,
notwithstanding my resisting, from a regard to their welfare, to the utmost of my power. As to
Donatus, seeing that he has obtained ordination before we could arrive at any decision in the
Council<SUP><A HREF="#P3763_1524054">423</A></SUP> as to his case, do as your wisdom
may guide you; it may be that his proud obstinacy has been subdued. But as to his brother, who was
the chief cause of Donatus leaving the monastery, I know not what to write, since you know what I
think of him. I do not presume to oppose what may seem best to one of your wisdom, rank, and piety;
and I hope with all my heart that you will do whatever you judge most profitable for the members of
the Church.</P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 401.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Hiswell-Beloved Brother Theodorus, Bishop Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I have resolved to commit to writing in this letter what I said when you and I were
conversing together as to the terms on which we would welcome clergy of the party of Donatus desiring
to become Catholics, in order that, if any one asked you what are our sentiments and practice in
regard to this, you might exhibit these by producing what I have written with my own hand. Be
assured, therefore, that we detest nothing in the Donatist clergy but that which renders them
schismatics and heretics, namely, their dissent from the unity and truth of the Catholic Church, in
their not remaining in peace with the people of God, which is spread abroad throughout the world, and
in their refusing to recognise the baptism of Christ in those who have received it. This their
grievous error, therefore, we reject; but the good name of God which they bear, and His sacrament
which they have received, we acknowledge in them, and embrace it with reverence and love. But for
this very reason we grieve over their wandering, and long to gain them for God by the love of Christ,
that they may have within the peace of the Church that holy sacrament for their salvation, which they
meanwhile have beyond the pale of the Church for their destruction. If, therefore, there be taken
away from between us the evil things which proceed from men, and if the good which comes from God and
belongs to both parties in common be duly honoured, there will ensue such brotherly concord, such
amiable peace, that the love of Christ shall gain the victory in men's hearts over the temptation of
the devil.</P>

<P>2. When, therefore, any come to us from the party of Donatus, we do not welcome the evil which
belongs to them, viz. their error and schism: these, the only obstacles to our concord, are removed
from between us, and we embrace our brethren, standing with them, as the apostle says, in "the unity
of the Spirit, in the bond of peace,"<SUP><A HREF="#P3770_1526567">424</A></SUP> and
acknowledging in them the good things which are divine, as their holy baptism, the blessing conferred
by ordination, their profession of self-denial, their vow of celibacy, their faith in the Trinity,
and such like; all which things were indeed theirs before, but "profited them nothing, because they
had not charity." For what truth is there in the profession of Christian charity by him who does not
embrace Christian unity? When, therefore, they come to the Catholic Church, they gain thereby not
what they already possessed, but something which they had not before,-namely, that those things which
they possessed begin then to be profitable to them. For in the Catholic Church they obtain the root
of charity in the bond of peace and in the fellowship of unity: so that all the sacraments of truth
which they hold serve not to condemn, but to deliver them. The branches ought not to boast that their
wood is the wood of the vine, not of the thorn; for if they do not live by union to the root, they
shall, notwithstanding their outward appearance, be cast into the fire. But of some branches which
were broken off the apostle says that "God is able to graft them in again."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3771_1527768">425</A></SUP> Wherefore, beloved brother, if you see any one
of the Donatist party in doubt as to the place into which they shall be welcomed by us, show them
this writing in my own hand, which is familiar to you, and let them have it to read if they desire
it; for "I call God for a record upon my soul," that I will welcome them on such terms as that they
shah retain not only the baptism of Christ which they have received, but also the honour due to their
vow of holiness and to their self-denying virtue.</P>

</UL><P>1. When we came to Subsana, and inquired into the things which had been done there in our
absence and against our will, we found some things exactly as we had heard reported, and some things
otherwise, but all things calling for lamentation and forbearance; and we endeavoured, in so far as
the Lord gave His help, to put them right by reproof, admonition, and prayer. What distressed us
most, since your departure from the place, was that the brethren who went thence to you were allowed
to go without a guide, which we beg you to excuse, as having taken place not from malice, but from an
excessive caution. For, believing as they did that these men were sent by our son Timotheus in order
to move you to be displeased with us, and being anxious to reserve the whole matter untouched until
we should come (when they hoped to see you along with us), they thought that the departure of these
men would be prevented if they were not furnished with a guide. That they did wrong in thus
attempting to detain the brethren we admit,-nay, who could doubt it? Hence also arose the story which
was told to Fossor,<SUP><A HREF="#P3778_1529832">427</A></SUP> that Timotheus had
already gone to you with these same brethren. This was wholly false, but the statement was not made
by the presbyter; and that Carcedonius our brother was wholly unaware of all these things, was most
clearly proved to us by all the ways in which such things are susceptible of proof.</P>

<P>2. But why spend more time on these circumstances! Our son Timotheus, being greatly disturbed
because he found himself, altogether in spite of his own wish, in such unlooked for perplexity,
informed us that, when you were urging him to serve God at Subsana, he broke forth vehemently, and
swore that he would never on any account leave you. And when we questioned him as to his present
wish, he replied that by this oath he was precluded from going to the place which we had previously
wished him to occupy, even though his mind were set at rest by the evidence given as to his freedom
from restraint. When we showed him that he would not be guilty of violating his oath if a bar was put
in the way of his being with you, not by him, but by you, in order to avoid a scandal; seeing that he
could by his oath bind only his own will, not yours, and he admitted that you had not bound yourself
reciprocally by your oath; at last he said, as it became a servant of God and a son of the Church to
say, that he would without hesitation agree to whatever should seem good to us, along with your
Holiness, to appoint concerning him. We therefore ask, and by the love of Christ implore you, in the
exercise of your sagacity, to remember all that we spoke to each other in this matter, and to make us
glad by your reply to this letter. For "we that are strong" (if, indeed, amid so great and perilous
temptations, we may presume to claim this title) are bound, as the apostle says, to "bear the
infirmities of the weak."<SUP><A HREF="#P3780_1531726">428</A></SUP> Our brother
Timotheus has not written to your Holiness, because your venerable brother has reported to all you.
May you be joyful the Lord, and remember us, our lord most blessed, and with all reverence most
beloved, our brother in sincerity.</P>

</UL><P>1. If I frankly say all that this case compels me to say, you may perhaps ask me where is my
concern for the preservation of charity but if I may not thus say all that the case demands, may I
not ask you where is the liberty conceded to friendship? Hesitating between these two alternatives, I
have chosen to write so much as may justify me without accusing you. You wrote that you were
surprised that we, notwithstanding our great grief at what was done, acquiesced in it, when it might
have been remedied by our correction; as if when things wrongly done have been afterwards, so far as
possible, corrected, they are no longer to be deplored; and more particularly, as if it were absurd
for us to acquiesce in that which, though wrongly done, ill is impossible for us to undo. Wherefore,
my brother, sincerely esteemed as such, your surprise may cease. For Timotheus was ordained a
subdeacon at Subsana against my advice and desire, at the time when the decision of his case was
still pending as the subject of deliberation and conference between us. Behold me still grieving over
this, although he has now returned to you; and we do not regret that in our consenting to his return
we obeyed your will.</P>

<P>2. May it please you to hear how, by rebuke, admonition, and prayer, we had, even before he went
away from this place, corrected the wrong which had been done, lest it should appear to you that up
to that time nothing had been corrected by us because he had not returned to you. By <I>rebuke</I>,
addressing ourselves first to Timotheus himself, because he did not obey you, but went away to your
Holiness without consulting our brother Carcedonius, to which act of his the origin of this
affliction is to be traced; and afterwards censuring the presbyter (Carcedonius) and Verinus, through
whom we found that the ordination of Timotheus had been managed. When all of these admitted, under
our rebuke, that in all the things alleged they had done wrong and begged forgiveness, we would have
acted with undue haughtiness if we had refused to believe that they were sufficiently corrected. For
they could not make that to be not done which had been done; and we by our rebuke were not expecting
or desiring to do more than bring them to acknowledge their faults, and grieve over them. By
<I>admonition</I>: first, in warning all never to dare again to do such things, lest they should
incur God's wrath; and then especially charging Timotheus, who said that he was bound only by his
oath to go to your Grace, that if your Holiness, considering all that we had spoken together on the
matter, should, as we hoped _might be the case, decide not to have him with you, out of regard for
the weak for whom Christ died, who might be offended, and for the discipline of the Church, which it
is perilous to disregard, seeing that he had begun to be a reader in this diocese,-he should then,
being free from the bond of his oath, devote himself with undisturbed mind to the service of God, to
whom we are to give an account of all our actions. By such admonitions as we were able to give, we
had also persuaded our brother Carcedonius to submit with perfect resignation to whatever might be
seen to be necessary in regard to him for the preservation of the discipline of the Church. By
<I>prayer</I>, moreover, we had laboured to correct ourselves, commending both the guidance and the
issues of our counsels to the mercy of God, and seeking that if any sinful anger had wounded us, we
might be cured by taking refuge under His healing right hand. Behold how much we had corrected by
rebuke, admonition, and prayer!</P>

<P>3. And now, considering the bond of charity, that we may not be possessed by Satan,-for we are not
ignorant of his devices,-what else ought we to have done than obey your wish, seeing that you thought
that what had been done could be remedied in no other way than by our giving back to your authority
him in whose person you complained that wrong had been done to you. Even our brother Carcedonius
himself consented to this, not indeed without much distress of spirit, on account of which I entreat
you to pray for him, but eventually without opposition, believing that he submitted to Christ in
submitting to you. Nay, even when I still thought it might be our duty to consider whether I should
not write a second letter to you, my brother, while Timotheus still remained here, he himself, with
filial reverence, feared to displease you, and cut my deliberations short by not only consenting, but
even urging, that Timotheus should be restored to you.</P>

<P>4. I therefore, brother Severus, leave my case to be decided by you. For I am sure that Christ
dwells in your heart, and by Him I beseech you to ask counsel from Him, submitting your mind to His
direction regarding the question whether, when a man had begun to be a Reader in the Church confided
to my care, having read, not once only, but a second and a third time, at Subsana, and in company
with the presbyter of the Church of Subsana had done the same also at Turres and Ciza and Verbalis,
it is either possible or right that he be pronounced to have never been a Reader. And as we have, in
obedience to God, corrected that which was afterwards done contrary to our will, do you also, in
obedience to Him, correct in like manner that which was formerly, through your not knowing the facts
of the case, wrongly done. For I have no fear of your failing to perceive what a door is opened for
breaking down the discipline of the Church, if, when a clergyman of any church has sworn to one of
another church that he will not leave him, that other encourage him to remain with him, alleging that
he does so that he may not be the occasion of the breaking of an oath; seeing that he who forbids
this, and declines to allow the other to remain with him (because that other could by his vow bind
only his own conscience), unquestionably preserves the order which is necessary to peace in a way
which none can justly censure.</P>

Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. We do not disdain to look upon bodies which are defective in beauty, especially seeing
that our souls themselves are not yet so beautiful as we hope that they shall be when He who is of
ineffable beauty shall have appeared, in whom, though now we see Him not, we believe; for then "we
shall be like Him," when "we shall see Him as He is."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3794_1538678">429</A></SUP> If you receive my counsel in a kindly and
brotherly spirit, I exhort you to think thus of your soul, as we do of our own, and not
presumptuously imagine that it is already perfect in beauty; but, as the apostle enjoins, "rejoice in
hope," and obey the precept which he annexes to this, when he says, "Rejoicing in hope, patient in
tribulation:"<SUP><A HREF="#P3795_1539044">430</A></SUP> "for we are saved by hope,"
as he says again; "but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3796_1539270">431</A></SUP> Let not this patience be wanting in thee, but
with a good conscience "wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart:
wait, I say, on the Lord."<SUP><A HREF="#P3797_1539468">432</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2. It is, of course, obvious that if you come to us while debarred from communion with the
venerable bishop Aurelius, you cannot be admitted to communion with us; but we would act towards you
with that same charity which we are assured shall guide his conduct. Your coming to us, however,
.should not on this account be embarrassing tous, because the duty of submission to this, out of
regard to the discipline of the Church, ought to be felt by yourself, especially if you have the
approval of your own conscience, which is known to yourself and to God. For if Aurelius has deferred
the examination of your case, he has done this not from dislike to you, but from the pressure of
other engagements; and if you knew his circumstances as well as you know your own, the delay would
cause you neither surprise nor sorrow. That it is the same with myself, I entreat you to believe on
my word, as you. are equally unable to know how I am occupied. But there are other bishops older than
I am, and both in authority more worthy and in place more convenient, by whose help you may more
easily expedite the affairs now pending in the Church committed to your charge. I have not, however,
failed to make mention of your distress, and of the complaint in your letter to my venerable brother
and colleague the aged Aurelius, whom I esteem with the respect due to his worth; I took care to
acquaint him with your innocence of the things laid to your charge, by sending him a copy of your
letter. It was not until a day, or at the most two, before Christmas,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3799_1541036">433</A></SUP> that I received the letter in which you informed
me of his intention to visit the Church at Badesile, by which you fear lest the people be disturbed
and influenced against you. I do not therefore presume to address by letter your people; for I could
write a reply to any who had written to me, but how could I put myself forward unasked to write to a
people not committed to my care?</P>

<P>3. Nevertheless, what I now say to you, who alone have written to me, may, through you, reach
others who should hear it. I charge you then, in the first place, not to bring the Church into
reproach by reading in the public assemblies those writings which the Canon of the Church has not
acknowledged; for by these, heretics, and especially the Manichaeans (of whom I hear that some are
lurking, not without encouragement, in your district), are accustomed to subvert the minds of the
inexperienced. I am amazed that a man of your wisdom should admonish me to forbid the reception into
the monastery of those who have come from you to us, in order that a decree of the Council may be
obeyed, and at the same time should forget another decree<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3801_1542190">434</A></SUP> of the same Council, declaring what are the
canonical Scriptures which ought to be read to the people. Read again the proceedings of the Council,
and commit them to memory: you will there find that the Canon which you refer to<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3802_1542519">435</A></SUP> as prohibiting the indiscriminate reception of
applicants for admission to a monastery, was not framed in regard to laymen, but applies to the
clergy alone. It is true there is no mention of monasteries in the canon; but it is laid down in
general, that no one may receive a clergyman belonging to another diocese [except in such a way as
upholds the discipline of the Church]. Moreover, it has been enacted in a recent Council,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3803_1542970">436</A></SUP> that any who desert a monastery, or are expelled
from one, shall not be elsewhere admitted either to clerical office or to the charge of a monastery.
If, therefore, you are in any measure disturbed regarding Privatio, let me inform you that he has not
yet been received by us into the monastery; but that I have submitted his case to the aged Aurelius,
and will act according to his decision. For it seems strange to me, if a man can be reckoned a Reader
who has read only once in public, and on that occasion read writings which are not canonical. If for
this reason he is regarded as an ecclesiastical reader, it follows that the writing which he read
must be esteemed as sanctioned by the Church. But if the writing be not sanctioned by the Church as
canonical, it follows that, although a man may have read it to a congregation, he is not thereby made
an ecclesiastical reader, [but is, as before, a layman]. Nevertheless I must, in regard to the young
man in question, abide by the decision of the arbiter whom I have named.</P>

<P>4. As to the people of Vigesile, who are to us as well as to you beloved in the bowels of Christ,
if they have refused to accept a bishop who has been deposed .by a plenary Council in Africa,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3805_1544236">437</A></SUP> they act wisely, and cannot be compelled to
yield, nor ought to be. And whoever shall attempt to compel them by violence to receive him, will
show plainly what is his character, and will make men well understand what his real character was at
an earlier time, when he would have had them believe no evil of him. For no one more effectually
discovers the worthlessness of his cause, than the man who, employing the secular power, or any other
kind of violent means, endeavours by agitating and complaining to recover the ecclesiastical rank
which he has forfeited. For his desire is not to yield to Christ service which He claims, but to
usurp over Christians an authority which they disown. Brethren, be cautious; great is the craft of
the devil, but Christ is the wisdom of God.</P>

My Lord Most Blessed and Worthy of Veneration, and My Father and Colleague in the Priestly Office,
Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Saluting your Excellency with the respect due to your worth, and earnestly seeking an
interest in your prayers, I beg to submit to the consideration of your wisdom the case of a certain
Abundantius, ordained a presbyter in the domain of Strabonia, belonging to my diocese. He had begun
to be unfavourably reported of, through his not walking in the way which becomes the servants of God;
and I being on this account alarmed, though not believing the rumours without examination, was made
more watchful of his conduct, and devoted some pains to obtain, if possible, indisputable evidences
of the evil courses with which he was charged. The first thing which I ascertained was, that he had
embezzled the money of a countryman, entrusted to him for religious purposes, and could give no
satisfactory account of his stewardship. The next thing proved against him, and admitted by his own
confession, was, that on Christmas day, on which the fast was observed by the Church of Gippe as by
all the other Churches, after taking leave of his colleague the presbyter of Gippe, as if going to
his own church about 11 A.M., he remained, without having any ecclesiastic in his company, in the
same parish, and dined, supped, and spent the night in the house of a woman of ill fame. It happened
that lodging in the same place was one of our clergy of Hippo, who had gone thither; and as the facts
were known beyond dispute to this witness, Abundantius could not deny the charge. As to the things
which he did deny, I left them to the divine tribunal, passing sentence upon him only in regard to
those things which he had not been permitted to conceal. I was afraid to leave him in charge of a
Church, especially of one placed as his was, in the very midst of rabid and barking heretics. And
when he begged me to give him a letter with a statement of his case to the presbyter of the parish of
Armema, in the district of Bulla, from which he had come to us, so as to prevent any exaggerated
suspicion there of his character, and in order that he might there live, if possible, a more
consistent life, having no duties as a presbyter, I was moved by compassion to do as he desired. At
the same time, it was very specially incumbent on me to submit to your wisdom these facts, test any
deception should be practised upon you.</P>

<P>2. I pronounced sentence in his case one hundred days before Easter Sunday, which falls this year
on the 7th of April. I have taken care to acquaint you with the date, because of the decree of
Council,<SUP><A HREF="#P3813_1547863">439</A></SUP> which I also did not conceal
from him, but explained to him the law of the Church, that if he thought anything could be done to
reverse my decision, unless he began proceedings with this view within a year, no one would, after
the lapse of that time, listen to his pleading. For my own part, my lord most blessed, and father
worthy of all veneration, I assure you that if I did not think that these instances of vicious
conversation in an ecclesiastic, especially when accompanied with an evil reputation, deserved to be
visited with the punishment appointed by the Council, I would be compelled now to attempt to sift
things which cannot be known, and either to condemn the accused upon doubtful evidence, or acquit him
for want of proof. When a presbyter, upon a day of fasting which was observed as such also in the
place in which he was, having taken leave of his colleague in the ministry in that place, and being
unattended by any ecclesiastic, ventured to tarry in the house of a woman of ill fame, and to dine
and sup and spend the night there, it seemed to me, whatever others might think, that he behoved to
be deposed from his office, as I durst not commit to his charge a Church of God. If it should so
happen that a different opinion be held by the ecclesiastical judges to whom he may appeal, seeing
that it has been decreed by the Council<SUP><A HREF="#P3814_1549259">440</A></SUP>
that the decision of six bishops be final in the case of a presbyter, let who will commit to him a
Church within his jurisdiction, I confess, for my own part, that I fear to entrust any congregation
whatever to persons like him, especially when nothing in the way of general good character can be
alleged as a reason for excusing these delinquencies; lest, if he were to break forth into some more
ruinous wickedness, I should be compelled with sorrow to blame myself for the harm done by his
crime.</P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 402.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>Addressed, Without Salutation, to Crispinus, the Donatist Bishop of Calama.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. You ought to have been influenced by the fear of God; but since, in your work of
rebaptizing the Mappalians,<SUP><A HREF="#P3820_1550019">441</A></SUP> you have
chosen to take advantage of the fear with which as man you could inspire them, let me ask you what
hinders the order of the sovereign from being carried out in the province, when the order of the
governor of the province has been so fully enforced in a village? If you compare the persons
concerned, you are but a vassal in possession; he is the Emperor. If you compare the positions of
both, you are in a property, he is on a throne; if you compare the causes maintained by both, his aim
is to heal division, and yours is to rend unity in twain. But we do not bid you stand in awe of man:
though we might take steps to compel you to pay, according to the imperial decree, ten pounds of gold
as the penalty of your outrage. Perhaps you might be unable to pay the fine imposed upon those who
rebaptize members of the Church, having been involved in so much expense in buying people whom you
might compel to submit to the rite. But, as I have said, we do not bid you be afraid of man: rather
let Christ fill you with fear. I should like to know what answer you could give Him, if He said to
you: "Crispinus, was it a great price which you paid in order to buy the fear of the Mappalian
peasantry; and does My death, the price paid by Me to purchase the love of all nations, seem little
in your eyes? Was the money which was counted out from your purse in acquiring these serfs in order
to their being rebaptized, a more costly sacrifice than the blood which flowed from My side in
redeeming the nations in order to their being baptized?" I know that, if you would listen to Christ,
you might hear many more such appeals, and might, even by the possession which you have obtained, be
warned how impious are the things which you have spoken against Christ. For if you think that your
title to hold what you have bought with money is sure by human law, how much more sure, by divine
law, is Christ's title to that which He hath bought with His own blood! And it is true that He of
whom it is written, "He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the
earth," shall hold with invincible might all which He has purchased/ but how can you expect with any
assurance to retain that which you think you have made your own by purchase in Africa, when you
affirm that Christ has lost the whole world, and been left with Africa alone as His portion?</P>

<P>2. But why multiply words? If these Mappalians have passed of their own free will into your
communion, let them hear both you and me on the question which divides us,-the words of each of us
being written down, and translated into the Punic tongue after having been attested by our
signatures; and then, all pressure through fear of their superior being removed, let these vassals
choose what they please. For by the things which we shall say it will be made manifest whether they
remain in error under coercion, or hold what they believe to be truth with their own consent. They
either understand these matters, or they do not: if they do not, how could you dare to transfer them
in their ignorance to your communion? and if they do, let them, as I have said, hear both sides, and
act freely for themselves. If there be any communities that have passed over from you to us, which
you believe to have yielded to the pressure of their superiors, let the same be done in their case;
let them hear both sides, and choose for themselves. Now, if you reject this proposal, who can fail
to be convinced that your reliance is not upon the force of truth? But you ought to beware of the
wrath of God both here and hereafter. I adjure you by Christ to give a reply to what I have
written.</P>

<P>1. I have heard that my letter has come to your hand. I have not yet received a reply, but I do
not on this account question your affection; doubtless something has hitherto prevented you.
Wherefore I know and avow that my prayer should be, that God would put it in your power to forward
your reply, for He has already given you power to prepare it, seeing that you can do so with the
utmost ease if you feel disposed.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>2. I have hesitated whether to give credence or not to a certain report which has reached me; but
I felt that I ought not to hesitate as to writing a few lines to you regarding the matter. To be
brief, I have heard that some brethren have told your Charity that I have written a book against you
and have sent it to Rome. Be assured that this is false: I call God to witness that I have not done
this. But if perchance there be some things in some of my writings in which I am found to have been
of a different opinion from you, I think you ought to know, or if it cannot be certainly known, at
least to believe, that such things have been written not with a view of contradicting you, but only
of stating my own views. In saying this, however, let me assure you that not only am I most ready to
hear in a brotherly spirit the objections which you may entertain to anything in my writings which
has displeased you, but I entreat, nay implore you, to acquaint me with them; and thus I shah be made
glad either by the correction of my mistake, or at least by the expression of your goodwill.</P>

<P>3. Oh that it were in my power, by our living near each other, if not under the same roof, to
enjoy frequent and sweet conference with you in the Lord! Since, however, this is not granted, I beg
you to take pains that this one way in which we can be together in the Lord be kept up; nay more,
improved and perfected. Do not refuse to write me in return, however seldom.</P>

<P>Greet with my respects our holy brother Paulinianus, and all the brethren who with you, and
because of you, rejoice in the Lord. May you, remembering us, be heard by the Lord in regard to all
your holy desires, my lord most beloved and longed for, my honoured brother in Christ.</P>

</UL><P>1. When my kinsman, our holy son Asterius, subdeacon, was just on the point of beginning his
journey, the letter of your Grace arrived, in which you clear yourself of the charge of having sent
to Rome a book written against your humble servant.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3838_1556594">443</A></SUP> I had not heard that charge; but by our brother
Sysinnius, deacon, copies of a letter addressed by some one apparently to me have come hither. In the
said letter I am exhorted to sing the <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>palinwdi/a</FONT>, confessing mistake in
regard to a paragraph of the apostle's writing, and to imitate Stesichorus, who, vacillating between
disparagement and praises of Helen, recovered, by praising her, the eyesight which he had forfeited
by speaking against her.<SUP><A HREF="#P3839_1557063">444</A></SUP> Although the
style and the method of argument appeared to be yours, I must frankly confess to your Excellency that
I did not think it right to assume without examination the authenticity of a letter of which I had
only seen copies, lest perchance, if offended by my reply, you should with justice complain that it
was my duty first to have made sure that you were the author, and only after that was ascertained, to
address you in reply. Another reason for my delay was the protracted illness of the pious and
venerable Paula. For, while occupied long in attending Upon her in severe illness, I had almost
forgotten your letter, or more correctly, the letter written in your name, remembering the verse,
"Like music in the day of mourning is an unseasonable discourse."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3840_1557871">445</A></SUP> Therefore, if it is your letter, write me
frankly that it is so, or send me a more accurate copy, in order that without any passionate rancour
we may devote ourselves to discuss scriptural truth; and I may either correct my own mistake, or show
that another has without good reason found fault with me.</P>

<P>2. Far be it from me to presume to attack anything which your Grace has written. For it is enough
for me to prove my own views without controverting what others hold. But it is well known to one of
your wisdom, that every one is satisfied with his own opinion, and that it is puerile
self-sufficiency to seek, as young men have of old been wont to do, to gain glory to one's own name
by assailing men who have become renowned. I am not so foolish as to think myself insulted by the
fact that you give an explanation different from mine; since you, on the other hand, are not wronged
by my views being contrary to those which you maintain. But that is the kind of reproof by which
friends may truly benefit each other, when each, not seeing his own bag of faults, observes, as
Persius has it, the wallet borne by the other.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3842_1559020">446</A></SUP> Let me say further, love one who loves you, and
do not because you are young challenge a veteran in the field of Scripture. I have had my time, and
have run my course to the utmost of my strength. It is but fair that I should rest, while you in your
turn run and accomplish great distances; at the same time (with your leave, and without intending any
disrespect), lest it should seem that to quote from the poets is a thing which you alone can do, let
me remind you of the encounter between Dares and Entellus,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3843_1559663">447</A></SUP> and of the proverb, "The tired ox treads with a
firmer step." With sorrow I have dictated these words. Would that I could receive your embrace, and
that by converse we might aid each other in learning!</P>

<P>3. With his usual effrontery, Calphurnius, surnamed Lanarius,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3845_1559961">448</A></SUP> has sent me his execrable writings, which I
understand that he has been at pains to disseminate in Africa also. To these I have replied in past,
and shortly; and I have sent you a copy of my treatise, intending by the first opportunity to send
you a larger work, when I have leisure to prepare it. In this treatise I have been careful not to
offend Christian feeling in any, but only to confute the lies and hallucinations arising from his
ignorance and madness.</P>

<P>Remember me, holy and venerable father. See how sincerely I love thee, in that I am unwilling,
even when challenged, to reply, and refuse to believe you to be the author of that which in another I
would sharply rebuke. Our brother Communis sends his respectful salutation.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Their Justly Beloved Lord Castorius, Their Truly Welcomed and Worthily Honoured Son,
Alypius and Augustin Send Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. An attempt was made by the enemy of Christians to cause, by occasion of our very dear and
sweet son your brother, the agitation of a most dangerous scandal within the Catholic Church, which
as a mother welcomed you to her affectionate embrace when you fled from a disinherited and separated
fragment into the heritage of Christ; the desire of that enemy being evidently to becloud with
unseemly melancholy the calm beauty of joy which was imparted to us by the blessing of your
conversion. But the Lord our God, who is compassionate and merciful, who comforteth them that are
cast down, nourishing the infants, and cherishing the infirm, permitted him to gain in some measure
success in this design, only to make us rejoice more over the prevention of the calamity than we
grieved over the danger. For it is a far more magnanimous thing to have resigned the onerous
responsibilities of the bishop's dignity in order to save the Church from danger, than to have
accepted these in order to have a share in her government. He truly proves that he was worthy of
holding that office, had the interests of peace permitted him to do so, who does not insist upon
retaining it when he cannot do so without endangering the peace of the Church. It has accordingly
pleased God to show, by means of your brother, our beloved son Maximianus, unto the enemies of His
Church, that there are within her those who seek not their own things, but the things of Jesus
Christ. For in laying down that ministry of stewardship of the mysteries of God, he was not deserting
his duty under the pressure of some worldly desire, but acting under the impulse of a pious love of
peace, lest, on account of the honour conferred upon him, there should arise among the members of
Christ an unseemly and dangerous, perhaps even fatal, dissension. For could anything have been more
infatuated and worthy of utter reprobation, than to forsake schismatics because of the peace of the
Catholic Church, and then to trouble that same Catholic peace by the question of one's own rank and
preferment? On the other hand, could anything be more praiseworthy, and more in accordance with
Christian charity, than that, after having forsaken the frenzied pride of the Donatists, he should,
in the manner of his cleaving to the heritage of Christ, give such a signal proof of humility under
the power of love for the unity of the Church? As for him, therefore, we rejoice indeed that he has
been proved of such stability that the storm of this temptation has not cast down what divine truth
had built in his heart; and therefore we desire and pray the Lord to grant that, by his life and
conversation in the future, he may make it more and more manifest how well he would have discharged
the responsibilities of that office which he would have accepted if that had been his duty. May that
eternal peace which is promised to the Church be given in recompense to him, who discerned that the
things which were not compatible with the peace of the Church were not expedient for him!</P>

<P>2. As for you, our dear son, in whom we have great joy, since you are not restrained from
accepting the office of bishop by any such considerations as have guided your brother in declining
it, it becomes one of your disposition to devote to Christ that which is in you by His own gift. Your
talents, prudence, eloquence, gravity, self-control, and everything else which adorns your
conversation, are the gifts of God. To what service can they be more fittingly devoted than to His by
whom they were bestowed, in order that they may be preserved, increased, perfected, and rewarded by
Him? Let them not be devoted to the service of this world, lest with it they pass away and perish. We
know that, in dealing with you, it is not necessary to insist much on your reflecting, as you may so
easily do, upon the hopes of vain men, their insatiable desires, and the uncertainty of life. Away,
therefore, with every expectation of deceptive and earthly felicity which your mind had grasped:
labour in the vineyard of God, where the fruit is sure, where so many promises have already received
so large measure of fulfilment, that it would be the height of madness to despair as to those which
remain. We beseech you by the divinity and humanity of Christ, and by the peace of that heavenly city
where we receive eternal rest after labouring for the time of our pilgrimage, to take the place as
the bishop of the Church of Vagina which your brother has resigned, not under ignominious deposition,
but by magnanimous concession. Let that people for whom we expect the richest increase of blessings
through your mind and tongue, endowed and adorned by the gifts of God,-let that people, we say,
perceive through you, that in what your brother has done, he was consulting not his own indolence,
but their peace.</P>

<P>We have given orders that this letter be not read to you until those to whom you are necessary
hold you in actual possession.<SUP><A HREF="#P3854_1565828">449</A></SUP> For we
hold you in the bond of spiritual love, because to us also you are very necessary as a colleague. Our
reason for not coming in person to you, you shall afterwards learn.</P>

<P>This letter is addressed by Alypius and Augustin to Naucelio a person through whom they
haddiscussed the question of the Donatist schism with Clarentius, an aged Donatist bishop (probably
the same with the Numidian bishop of Tabraca, who took part in the Conference at Carthage in 411
a.d.). The ground traversed in the letter is the same as in pages 296 and 297, in Letter LI.,
regarding the inconsistencies of the Donatists in the case of Felicianus of Musti. We therefore leave
it untranslated.</P>

Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. Never since I began to write to you, and to long for your writing in return, have I met with a
better opportunity for our exchanging communications than now, when my letter is to be carried to you
by a most faithful servant and minister of God, who is also a very dear friend of mine, namely, our
son Cyprian, deacon. Through him I expect to receive a letter from you with all the certainty which
is in a matter of this kind possible. For the son whom I have named will not be found wanting in
respect of .zeal in asking, or persuasive influence in obtaining a reply from you; nor will he fail
in diligently keeping, promptly bearing, and faithfully delivering the same. I only pray that if I be
in any way worthy of this, the Lord may give His help and favour to your heart and to my desire, so
that no higher will may hinder that which your brotherly goodwill inclines you to do.</P>

<P>2. As I have sent you two letters already to which I have received no reply, I have resolved to
send you at this time copies of both of them, for I suppose that they never reached you. If they did
reach you, and your replies have failed, as may be the case, to reach me, send me a second time the
same as you sent before, if you have copies of them preserved: if you have not, dictate again what I
may read, and do not refuse to send to these former letters the answer for which I have been waiting
so long. My first letter to you, which I had prepared while I was a presbyter, was to be delivered to
you by a brother of ours, Profuturus, who afterwards became my colleague in the episcopate, and has
since then departed from this life; but he could not then bear it to you in person, because at the
very time when he intended to begin his journey, he was prevented by his ordination to the weighty
office of bishop, and shortly afterwards he died. This letter I have resolved also to send at this
time, that you may know how long I have cherished a burning desire for conversation with you, and
with what reluctance I submit to the remote separation which prevents my mind from having access to
yours through our bodily senses, my brother, most amiable and honoured among the members of the
Lord.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. In this letter I have further to say, that I have since heard that you have translated Job out
of the original Hebrew, although in your own translation of the same prophet from the Greek tongue we
had already a version of that book. In that earlier version you marked with asterisks the words found
in the Hebrew but wanting in the Greek, and with obelisks the words found in the Greek but wanting in
the Hebrew; and this was done with such astonishing exactness, that in some places we have every word
distinguished by a separate asterisk, as a sign that these words are in the Hebrew, but not in the
Greek. Now, however, in this more recent version from the Hebrew, there is not the same scrupulous
fidelity as to the words; and it perplexes any thoughtful reader to understand either what was the
reason for marking the asterisks in the former version with so much care that they indicate the
absence from the Greek version of even the smallest grammatical particles which have not been
rendered from the Hebrew, or what is the reason for so much less care having been taken in this
recent version from the Hebrew to secure that these same particles be found in their own places. I
would have put down here an extract or two in illustration of this criticism; but at present I have
not access to the Ms. of the translation from the Hebrew. Since, however, your quick discernment
anticipates and goes beyond not only what I have said, but also what I meant to say, you already
understand, I think, enough to be able, by giving the reason for the plan which you have adopted, to
explain what perplexes me.</P>

<P>4. For my part, I would much rather that you would furnish us with a translation of the Greek
version of the canonical Scriptures known as the work of the Seventy translators. For if your
translation begins to be more generally read in many churches, it will be a grievous thing that, in
the reading of Scripture, differences must arise between the Latin Churches and the Greek Churches,
especially seeing that the discrepancy is easily condemned in a Latin version by the production of
the original in Greek, which is a language very widely known; whereas, if any one has been disturbed
by the occurrence of something to which he was not accustomed in the translation taken from the
Hebrew, and alleges that the new translation is wrong, it will be found difficult, if not impossible,
to get at the Hebrew documents by which the version to which exception is taken may be defended. And
when they are obtained, who will submit, to have so many Latin and Greek authorities: pronounced to
be in the wrong? Besides all this, Jews, if consulted as to the meaning of the Hebrew text, may give
a different opinion from yours: in which case it will seem as if your presence were indispensable, as
being the only one who could refute their view; and it would be a miracle if one could be found
capable of acting as arbiter between you and them.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>5. A certain bishop, one of our brethren, having introduced in the church over which he presides
the reading of your version, came upon a word in the book of the prophet Jonah, of which you have
given a very different rendering from that which had been of old familiar to the senses and memory of
all the worshippers, and had been chanted for so many generations in the church.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn38.htm#P3871_1572516">450</A></SUP> Thereupon arose such a tumult in the
congregation, especially among the Greeks, correcting what had been read, and denouncing the
translation as false, that the bishop was compelled to ask the testimony of the Jewish residents (it
was in the town of Oea). These, whether from ignorance or from spite, answered that the words in the
Hebrew Mss. were correctly rendered in the Greek version, and in the Latin one taken from it. What
further need I say? The man was compelled to correct your version in that passage as if it had been
falsely translated, as he desired not to be left without a congregation,-a calamity which he narrowly
escaped. From this case we also are led to think that you may be occasionally mistaken. You will also
observe how great must have been the difficulty if this had occurred in those writings which cannot
be explained by comparing the testimony of languages now in use.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>6. At the same time, we are in no small measure thankful to God for the work in which you have
translated the Gospels from the original Greek, because in almost ever), passage we have found
nothing to object to, when we compared it with the Greek Scriptures. By this work, any disputant who
supports an old false translation is either convinced or confuted with the utmost ease by the
production and collation of Mss. And if, as indeed very rarely happens, something be found to which
exception may be taken, who would be so unreasonable as not to excuse it readily in a work so useful
that it cannot be too highly praised? I wish you would have the kindness to open up to me what you
think to be the reason of the frequent discrepancies between the text supported by the Hebrew codices
and the Greek Septuagint version. For the latter has no mean authority, seeing that it has obtained
so wide circulation, and was the one which the apostles used, as is not only proved by looking to the
text itself, but has also been, as I remember, affirmed by yourself. You would therefore confer upon
us a much greater boon if you gave an exact Latin translation of the Greek Septuagint version: for
the variations found in the different codices of the Latin text are intolerably numerous; and it is
so justly open to suspicion as possibly different from what is to be found in the Greek, that one has
no confidence in either quoting it or proving anything by its help. </P>

<P>I thought that this letter was to be a short one, but it has somehow been as pleasant to me to go
on with it as if I were talking with you. I conclude with entreating you by the Lord kindly to send
me a full reply, and thus give me, so far as is in your power, the pleasure of your presence.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Augustin, My Lord Truly Holy, and Most Blessed Father, Jerome Sends Greeting in the
Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. You are sending me letter upon letter, and often urging me to answer a certain letter of yours,
a copy of which, without your signature, had reached me through our brother Sysinnius, deacon, as I
have already written, which letter you tell me that you entrusted first to our brother Profuturus,
and afterwards to some one else; but that Profuturus was prevented from finishing his intended
journey, and having been ordained a bishop, was removed by sudden death; and the second messenger,
whose name you do not give, was afraid of the perils of the sea, and gave up the voyage which he had
intended. These things being so, I am at a loss to express my surprise that the same letter! is
reported to be in the possession of most of the Christians in Rome, and throughout Italy, and has
come to every one but myself, to whom alone it was ostensibly sent. I wonder at this: all the more,
because the brother Sysinnius aforesaid tells me that he found it among the rest of your published
works, not in Africa, not in your possession, but in an island of the Adriatic some five years
ago.</P>

<P>2. True friendship can harbour no suspicion; a friend must speak to his friend as freely as to his
second self. Some of my acquaintances, vessels of Christ, of whom there is a very large number in
Jerusalem and in the holy places, suggested to me that this had not been done by you in a guileless
spirit, but through desire for praise and celebrity, and <I>&eacute;clat</I> in the eyes of the
people, intending to become famous at my expense; that many might know that you challenged me, and I
feared to meet you; that you had written as a man of learning, and I had by silence confessed my
ignorance, and had at last found one who knew how to stop my garrulous tongue. I, however, let me say
it frankly, refused at first to answer your Excellency, because I did not believe that the letter, or
as I may call it (using a proverbial expression), the honeyed sword, was sent from you. Moreover, I
was cautious lest I should seem to answer uncourteously a bishop of my own communion, and to censure
anything in the letter of one who censured me, especially as I judged some of its statements to be
tainted with heresy.<SUP><A HREF="#P3882_1577506">451</A></SUP> Lastly, I was afraid
lest you should have reason to remonstrate with me, saying, "What! had you seen the letter to be
mine,-had you discovered in the signature attached to it the autograph of a hand well known to you,
when you so carelessly wounded the feelings of your friend, and reproached me with that which the
malice of. another had conceived?"</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. Wherefore, as I have already written, either send me the identical letter in question
subscribed with your own hand, or desist from annoying an old man, who seeks retirement in his
monastic cell. If you wish to exercise or display your learning, choose as your antagonists, young,
eloquent, and illustrious men, of whom it is said that many are found in Rome, who may be neither
unable nor afraid to meet you, and to enter the lists with a bishop in debates concerning the Sacred
Scriptures. As for me, a soldier once, but a retired veteran now, it becomes me rather to applaud the
victories won by you and others, than with my worn-out body to take part in the conflict; beware
lest, if you persist in demanding a reply, I call to mind the history of the way in which Quintus
Maximus by his patience defeated Hannibal, who was, in the pride of youth, confident of
success.<SUP><A HREF="#P3885_1578916">452</A></SUP> </P>

favour of his youthful son the kindnesses of King David and all the charms of his court, taught us
that old age ought neither to desire these things, nor to accept them when offered.</P>

<P>4. As to your calling God to witness that you had not written a book against me, and of course had
not sent to Rome what you had never written, adding that, if perchance some things were found in your
works in which a different opinion from mine was advanced, no wrong had thereby been done to me,
because you had, without any intention of offending me, written only what you believed to be right; I
beg you to hear me with patience. You never wrote a book against me: how then has there been brought
to me a copy, written by another hand, of a treatise containing a rebuke administered to me by you?
How comes Italy to possess a treatise of yours which you did not write? Nay, how can you reasonably
ask me to reply to that which you solemnly assure me was never written by you? Nor am I so foolish as
to think that I am insulted by you, if in anything your opinion differs from mine. But if,
challenging me as it were to single combat, you take exception to my views, and demand a reason for
what I have written, and insist upon my correcting what you judge to be an error, and call upon me to
recant it in a humble <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>palinw|di/a</FONT>, and speak of your curing me of
blindness; in this I maintain that friendship is wounded, and the laws of brotherly union are set at
nought. Let not the world see us quarrelling like children, and giving material for angry contention
between those who may become our respective supporters or adversaries. I write what I have now
written, because I desire to cherish towards you pure and Christian love, and not to hide in my heart
anything which does not agree with the utterance of my lips. For it does not become me, who have
spent my lift from youth until now, sharing the arduous labours of pious brethren in an obscure
monastery, to presume to write anything against a bishop of my own communion, especially against one
whom I had begun to love before I knew him, who also sought my friendship before I sought his, and
whom I rejoiced to see rising as a successor to myself in the careful study of the Scriptures.
Wherefore either disown that book, if you are not its author, and give over! urging me to reply to
that which you never wrote; or if the book is yours, admit it frankly; so that! if I write anything
in self-defence, the responsibility may lie on you who gave, not on me who am forced to accept, the
challenge.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>5. You say also, that if there be anything in your writings which has displeased me, and which I
would wish to correct, you are ready to receive my criticism as a brother; and you not only assure me
that you would rejoice in such proof of my goodwill toward you, but you earnestly ask me to do this.
I tell you: again, without reserve, what I feel: you are challenging an old man, disturbing the peace
of one who asks only to be allowed to be silent, and you seem to desire to display your learning. It
is not for one of my years to give the impression of enviously disparaging one whom I ought rather to
encourage by approbation. And if the I ingenuity of perverse men finds something which! they may
plausibly censure in the writings even of evangelists and prophets, are you amazed if, in your books,
especially in your exposition of passages in Scripture which are exceedingly difficult of
interpretation, some things be found which are not perfectly correct? This I say, however, not
because I can at this time pronounce anything in your works to merit censure. For, in the first
place, I have never read them with attention; and in the second place, we have not beside us a supply
of copies of what you have written, excepting the books of Soliloquies and Commentaries on some of
the Psalms; which, if I were disposed to criticise them, I could prove to be at variance, I shall not
say with my own opinion, for I am nobody, but with the interpretations of the older Greek
commentators.</P>

<P>Farewell, my very dear friend, my son in years, my father in ecclesiastical dignity; and to this I
most particularly request your attention, that henceforth you make sure that I be the first to
receive whatever you may write to me.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Jerome, My Venerable and Most Esteemed Brother and Fellow-Presbyter Augustin Sends
Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. Although I suppose that, before this reaches you, you have received through our son the deacon
Cyprian, a servant of God, the letter which I sent by him, from which you would be apprised with
certainty that I wrote the letter of which you mentioned that a copy had been brought to you; in
consequence of which I suppose that I have begun already, like the rash Dares, to be beaten and
belaboured by the missiles and the merciless fists of a second Entellus<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3902_1584083">454</A></SUP> in the reply which you have written;
nevertheless I answer in the meantime the letter which you have deigned to send me by our holy son
Asterius, in which I have found many proofs of your most kind goodwill to me, and at the same time
some signs of your having in some measure felt agrieved by me. In reading it, therefore, I was no
sooner soothed by one sentence than I was buffeted in another; my wonder being especially called
forth by this, that after alleging, as your reason for not rashly accepting as authentic he letter
from me of which you had a copy, the fact that, offended by your reply, I might justly remonstrate
with you, because you ought first to have ascertained that it was mine before answering it, you go on
to command me to acknowledge the letter frankly if it is mine, or send a more reliable copy of it, in
order that we may, without any bitterness of feeling, address ourselves to the discussion of
scriptural doctrine. For how can we engage in such discussion without bitterness of feeling, if you
have made up your mind to offend me? or, if your mind is not made up to this, what reason could I
have had, when you did not offend me, for justly complaining as having been offended by you, that you
ought first to have made sure that the letter was mine, and only then to have replied, that is to
say, only then to have offended me? For if there had been nothing to offend me in your reply, I could
have had no just ground of complaint. Accordingly, when you write such a reply to that letter as must
offend me, what hope is left of our engaging without any bitterness in the discussion of scriptural
doctrine? Far be it from me to take offence if you are willing and able to prove, by incontrovertible
argument, that you have apprehended more correctly than I have the meaning of that passage in Paul's
Epistle [to the Galatians], or of any other text in Holy Scripture: nay, more, far be it from me to
count it aught else than gain to myself, and cause of thankfulness to you, if in anything I am either
informed by your teaching or set right by your correction.</P>

<P>2. But, my very dear brother, you could not think that I could be offended by your reply, had you
not thought that you were offended by what I had written. For I could never have entertained
concerning you the idea that you had not felt yourself offended by me if you so flamed your reply as
to offend me in return. If, on the other hand, I have been supposed by you to be capable of such
preposterous folly as to take offence when you had not written in such a way as to give me occasion,
you have in this already wronged me, that you have entertained such an opinion of me. But surely you
who are so cautious, that although you recognised my style in the letter of which you had a copy, you
refused to believe its authenticity, would not without consideration believe me to be so different
from what your experience has proved me to be. For if you had good reason for seeing that I might
justly complain had you hastily concluded that a letter not written by me was mine, how much more
reasonably may I complain if you form, without consideration, such an estimate of myself as is
contradicted by your own experience! You would not therefore go so far astray in your judgment as to
believe, when you had written nothing by which I could be offended, that I would nevertheless be so
foolish as to be capable of being offended by such a reply.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. There can therefore be no doubt that you were prepared to reply in such a way as would offend
me, if you had only indisputable evidence that the letter was mine. Accordingly, since I do not
believe that you would think it right to offend me unless you had just cause, it remains for me to
confess, as I now do, my fault as having been the first to offend by writing that letter which I
cannot deny to be mine. Why should I strive to swim against the current, and not rather ask pardon? I
therefore entreat you by the mercy of Christ to forgive me wherein I have injured you, and not to
render evil for evil by injuring me in return. For it will be an injury to me if you pass over in
silence anything which you find wrong in either word or action of mine. If, indeed, you rebuke in me
that which merits no rebuke, you do wrong to yourself, not to me; for far be it from one of your life
and holy vows to rebuke merely from a desire to give offence, using the tongue of malice to condemn
in me that which by the truth-revealing light of reason you know to deserve no blame. Therefore
either rebuke kindly him whom, though he is free from fault, you think to merit rebuke; or with a
father's kindness soothe him whom you cannot bring to agree with you. For it is possible that your
opinion may be at variance with the truth, while notwithstanding your actions are in harmony with
Christian charity: for I also shall most thankfully receive your rebuke as a most friendly action,
even though the thing censured be capable of defence, and therefore ought not to have been censured;
or else I shall acknowledge both your kindness and my fault, and shall be found, so far as the Lord
enables me, grateful for the one, and corrected in regard to the other.</P>

<P>4. Why, then, shah I fear your words, hard, perhaps, like the boxing-gloves of Entellus, but
certainly fitted to do me good? The blows of Entellus were intended not to heal, but to harm, and
therefore his antagonist was conquered, not cured. But I, if I receive your correction calmly as a
necessary medicine, shall not be pained by it. If, however, through weakness, either common to human
nature or peculiar to myself, I cannot help feeling some pain from rebuke, even when I am justly
reproved, it is far better to have a tumour in one's head cured, though the lance cause pain, than to
escape the pain by letting the disease go on. This was clearly seen by him who said that, for the
most part, our enemies who expose our faults are more useful than friends who are afraid to reprove
us. For the former, in their angry recriminations, sometimes charge us with what we indeed require to
correct; but the latter, through fear of destroying the sweetness of friendship, show less boldness
on behalf of right than they ought. Since, therefore, you are, to quote your own comparison, an
ox<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3907_1590419">455</A></SUP> worn out, perhaps, as to your bodily
strength by reason of years, but unimpaired in mental vigour, and toiling still assiduously and with
profit in the Lord's threshing-floor; here am I, and in whatever I have spoken amiss, tread firmly on
me: the weight of your venerable age should not be grievous to me, if the chaff of my fault be so
bruised under foot as to be separated from me.</P>

<P>5. Let me further say, that it is with the utmost affectionate yearning that I read or recollect
the words at the end of your letter, "Would that I could receive your embrace, and that by converse
we might aid each other in learning." For my part, I say,-Would that we were even dwelling in parts
of the earth less widely separated; so that if we could not meet for converse, we might at least have
a more frequent exchange of letters. For as it is, so great is the distance by which we are prevented
from any kind of access to each other through the eye and ear, that I remember writing to your
Holiness regarding these words in the Epistle to the Galatians when I was young; and behold I am now
advanced in age, and have not yet received a reply, and a copy of my letter has reached you by some
strange accident earlier than the letter, itself, about the transmission of which I took no: small
pains. For the man to whom I entrusted it neither delivered it to you nor returned it to me. So great
in my esteem is the value of those of your writings which we have been able to procure, that I should
prefer to all other studies the privilege, if it were attainable by me, of sitting by your side and
learning from you: Since I cannot do this myself, I propose to send to you one of my sons in the
Lord, that he may for my benefit be instructed by you, in the event of my receiving from you a
favourable reply in regard to the matter. For I have not now, and I can never hope to have, such
knowledge of the Divine Scriptures as I see you possess. Whatever abilities I may have for such
study, I devote entirely to the instruction of the people whom God has entrusted to me; and I am
wholly precluded by my ecclesiastical occupations from having leisure for any further prosecution of
my studies than is necessary for my duty in public teaching.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>6. I am not acquainted with the writings speaking injuriously of you, which you tell me have come
into Africa. I have, however, received the reply to these which you have been pleased to send. After
reading it, let me say frankly, I have been exceedingly grieved that the mischief of such painful
discord has arisen between persons once so loving and intimate, and formerly united by the bond of a
friendship which was well known in almost all the Churches. In that treatise of yours, any one may
see how you are keeping yourself under restraint, and holding back the stinging keenness of your
indignation, lest you should render railing for railing. If, however, even in reading this reply of
yours, I fainted with grief and shuddered with fear, what would be the effect produced in me by the
things which he has written against you, if they should come into my possession! "Woe unto the world
because of offences!"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3911_1593593">456</A></SUP> Behold the complete
fulfilment of which He who is Truth foretold: "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall
wax cold. "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3912_1593749">457</A></SUP> For what trusting hearts can
now pour themselves forth with any assurance of their confidence being reciprocated? Into whose
breast may confiding love now throw itself without reserve? In short, where is the friend who may not
be feared as possibly a future enemy, if the breach that we deplore could arise between Jerome and
Rufinus? Oh, sad and pitiable is our portion! Who can rely upon the affection of his friends because
of what he knows them to be now, when he has no foreknowledge of what they shall afterwards become?
But why should I reckon it cause for sorrow, that one man is thus ignorant of what another may
become, when no man knows even what he himself is afterwards to be? The utmost that he knows, and
that he knows but imperfectly, is his present condition; of what he shall hereafter become he has no
knowledge.</P>

<P>7. Do the holy and blessed angels possess not Only this knowledge of their actual character, but
also a foreknowledge of what they shall afterward become? If they do, I cannot see how it was
possible for Satan ever to have been happy, even while he was still a good angel, knowing, as in this
case he must have known, his future transgression and eternal punishment. I would wish to hear what
you think as to this question, if indeed it be one which it would be profitable for us to be able to
answer. But mark here what I suffer from the lands and seas which keep us, so far as the body is
concerned, distant from each other. If I were myself the letter which you are now reading, you might
have told me already what I have just asked; but now, when will you write me a reply? when will you
get it sent away? when will it come here? when shall I receive it? And yet, would that I were sure
that it would come at last, though meanwhile I must summon all the patience which I can command to
endure the unwelcome but unavoidable delay! Wherefore I come back to those most delightful words of
your letter, filled with your holy longing, and I in turn appropriate them as my own: "Would that I
might receive your embrace, and that by converse we might aid each other in learning,"-if indeed
there be any sense in which I could possibly impart instruction to you.</P>

<P>8. When by these words, now mine not less than yours, I am gladdened and refreshed, and when I am
comforted not a little by the fact that in both of us a desire for mutual fellowship exists, though
meanwhile unsatisfied, it is not long before I am pierced through by darts of keenest sorrow when I
consider Rufinus and you, to whom God had granted in fullest measure and for a length of time that
which both of us have longed for, so that in most close and endearing fellowship you feasted together
on the honey of the Holy Scriptures, and think how between you the bright of such exceeding
bitterness has found its way, constraining us to ask when, where, and in whom the same calamity may
not be reasonably feared; seeing that it has befallen you at the very time when, unencumbered, having
cast away secular burdens, you were following the Lord and were living together in that very land
which was trodden by the feet of our Lord, when He said, "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give
unto you; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3915_1596963">458</A></SUP> being, moreover, men of
mature age, whose life was devoted to the study of the word of God. Truly "man's life on earth is a
period of trial."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3916_1597126">459</A></SUP> If I could anywhere
meet you both together-which, alas, I cannot hope to do-so strong are my agitation, grief, and fear,
that I think I would cast myself at your feet, and there weeping till I could weep no more, would,
with all the eloquence of love, appeal first to each of you for his own sake, then to both for each
other's sake, and for the sake of those, especially the weak, "for whom Christ died,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3917_1597606">460</A></SUP> whose salvation is in peril, as they look on you
who occupy a place so conspicuous on the stage of time; imploring you not to write and scatter abroad
these hard words against each other, which, if at any time you who are now at variance were
reconciled, you could not destroy, and which you could not then venture to read lest strife should be
kindled anew.</P>

<P>9. But I say to your Charity, that nothing has made me tremble more than your estrangement from
Rufinus, when I read in your letter some of the indications of your being displeased with me. I refer
not so much to what you say of Entellus and of the wearied ox, in which you appear to me to use
genial pleasantry rather than angry threat, but to that which you have evidently written in earnest,
of which I have already spoken perhaps more than was fitting, but not more than my fears compelled me
to do,-namely, the words, "lest perchance, being offended, you should have reason to remonstrate with
me." If it be possible for us to examine and discuss anything by which our hearts may be nourished,
without any bitterness of discord</P>

<P>I entreat you let us address ourselves to this. But if it is not possible for either of us to
point out what he may judge to demand correction in the other's writings, without being suspected of
envy and regarded as wounding friendship, let us, having regard to our spiritual life and health,
leave such conference alone. Let us content ourselves with smaller attainments in that [knowledge]
which puffeth up, if we can thereby preserve unharmed that [charity] which edifieth.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3920_1599197">461</A></SUP> I feel that I come far short of that perfection
of which it is written, "If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3921_1599352">462</A></SUP> but through God's mercy I truly believe myself
able to ask your forgiveness for that in which I have offended you: and this you ought to make plain
to me, that through my hearing you, you may gain your brother.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3922_1599583">463</A></SUP> Nor should you make it a reason for leaving me
in error, that the distance between us on the earth's surface makes it impossible for us to meet face
to face. As concerns the subjects into which we inquire, if I know, or believe, or think that I have
got hold of the truth in a matter in which your opinion is different from mine, I shall by all means
endeavour, as the Lord may enable me, to maintain my view without injuring you. And as to any offence
which I may give to you, so soon as I perceive your displeasure,I shall unreservedly beg your
forgiveness.</P>

<P>10. I think, moreover, that your reason for being displeased with me can only be, that I have
either said what I ought not, or have not expressed myself in the manner in which I ought: for I do
not wonder that we are less thoroughly known to each other than we are to our most close and intimate
friends. Upon the love of such friends I readily cast myself without reservation, especially when
chafed and wearied by the scandals of this world; and in their love I rest without any disturbing
care: for I perceive that God is there, on whom I confidingly cast myself, and in whom I confidingly
rest. Nor in this confidence am I disturbed by any fear of that uncertainty as to the morrow which
must be present when we lean upon human weakness, and which I have in a former paragraph bewailed.
For when I perceive that a man is burning with Christian love, and feel that thereby he has been made
a faithful friend to me, whatever plans or thoughts of mine I entrust to him I regard as entrusted
not to the man, but to Him in whom his character makes it evident that he dwells: for "God is love,
and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3924_1601321">464</A></SUP> and if he cease to dwell in love, his forsaking
it cannot but cause as much pain as his abiding in it caused joy. Nevertheless, in such a case, when
one who was an intimate friend has become an enemy, it is better that he should search out what
ingenuity may help him to fabricate to our prejudice, than that he should find what anger may provoke
him to reveal. This every one most easily secures, not by concealing what he does, but by doing
nothing which he would wish to conceal. And this the mercy of God grants to good and pious men: they
go out and in among their friends in liberty and without fear, whatever these friends may afterwards
become: the sins which may have been committed by others within their knowledge they do not reveal,
and they themselves avoid doing what they would fear to see revealed. For when any false charge is
fabricated by a slanderer, either it is disbelieved, or, if it is believed, our reputation alone is
injured, our spiritual wellbeing is not affected. But when, any sinful action is committed, that
action becomes a secret enemy, even though it be not: revealed by the thoughtless or malicious talk
of one acquainted with our secrets. Wherefore any, person of discernment may see in your own; example
how, by the comfort of a good conscience, you bear what would otherwise be insupportable-the
incredible enmity of one who was formerly your most intimate and beloved friend; and how even what he
utters against you, even what may to your disadvantage be believed by some, you turn to good account
as the armour of righteousness on the left hand, which is not less useful than armour on the right
hand<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3925_1602987">465</A></SUP> in our warfare with the devil. But
truly I would rather see him less bitter in his accusations, than see you thus more fully armed by
them. This is a great and a lamentable wonder, that you should have passed from such amity to such
enmity: it would be a joyful and a much greater event, should you come back from such enmity to the
friendship of former days.</P>

</UL><P>1. I write to remind you of the request which I made to you as a sincere friend when you were
here, that you would not refuse to send a letter of mine to our holy brother and fellow-presbyter
Jerome; in order, moreover, to let your Charity know in what terms you ought to write to him on my
behalf. I have sent a copy of my letter to him, and of his to me, by reading which your pious wisdom
may easily see both the moderation of tone which I have been careful tb preserve, and the vehemence
on his part by which I have been not unreasonably filled with fear. If, however, I have written
anything which I ought not to have written, or have expressed myself in an unbecoming way, let it not
be to him, but to myself, in brotherly love, that you send your opinion of what I have done, in order
that, if I am convinced of my fault by your rebuke, I may ask his forgiveness.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Augustin, My Lord Truly Holy, and Most Blessed Father, Jerome Sends Greeting in
Christ.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. I have received by Cyprian, deacon, three letters, or rather three little books, at the same
time, from your Excellency, containing what you call sundry questions, but what I feel to be
animadversions on opinions which I have published, to answer which, if I were disposed to do it,
would require a pretty large volume. Nevertheless I shall attempt to reply without exceeding the
limits of a moderately long letter, and without causing delay to our brother, now in haste to depart,
who only three days before the time fixed for his journey asked earnestly for a letter to take with
him, in consequence of which I am compelled to pour out these sentences, such as they are, almost
without premeditation, answering you in a rambling effusion, prepared not in the leisure of
deliberate composition, but in the hurry of extemporaneous dictation, which usually produces a
discourse that is more the offspring of chance than the parent of instruction; just as unexpected
attacks throw into confusion even the bravest soldiers, and they are compelled to take to flight
before they can gird on their armour.</P>

<P>2. But our armour is Christ; it is that which the Apostle Paul prescribes when, writing to the
Ephesians, he says, "Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the
evil day;" and again, "Stand, therefore, having your loins gin about with truth, and having on the
breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above
all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
wicked: and take the helmetof salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3938_1606257">466</A></SUP> Armed with these weapons, King
David went forth in his day to battle: and taking from the torrent's bed five smooth rounded stones,
he proved that, even amidst all the eddying currents of the world, his feelings were free both from
roughness and from defilement; drinking of the brook by the way, and therefore lifted up in spirit,
he cut off the head of Goliath, using the proud enemy's own sword as the fittest instrument of
death,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3939_1606714">467</A></SUP> smiting the profane boaster on the
forehead and wounding him in the same place in which Uzziah was smitten with leprosy when he presumed
to usurp the priestly office;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3940_1606908">468</A></SUP> the same
also in which shines the glory that makes the saints rejoice in the Lord, saying, "The light of Thy
countenance is sealed upon us, O Lord."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3941_1607083">469</A></SUP>
Let us therefore also say, "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise:
awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3942_1607299">470</A></SUP> that in us may be fulfilled that word, "Open thy
mouth wide, and I will fill it;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3943_1607403">471</A></SUP> and,
"The Lord shall give the word with great power to them that publish it."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3944_1607503">472</A></SUP> I am well assured that your prayer as well as
mine is, that in our contendings the victory may remain with the truth. For you seek Christ's glory,
not your own: if you are victorious, I also gain a victory if I discover my error. On the other hand,
if I win the day, the gain is yours; for "the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the
parents for the children."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3945_1607918">473</A></SUP> We read,
moreover, in Chronicles, that the children of Israel went to battle with their minds set upon
peace,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3946_1608049">474</A></SUP> seeking even amid swords and
bloodshed and the prostrate slain a victory not for themselves, but for peace. Let me therefore, if
it be the will of Christ, give an answer to all that you have written, and attempt in a short
dissertation to solve your numerous questions. I pass by the conciliatory phrases in your courteous
salutation: I say nothing of the compliments by which you attempt to take the edge off your censure:
let me come at once to the matters in debate.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>3. You say that you received from some brother a book of mine, in which I have given a list of
ecclesiastical writers, both Greek and Latin, but which had no title; and that when you asked the
brother aforesaid (I quote your own statement) why the title-page had no inscription, or what was the
name by which the book was known, he answered that it was called "Epitaphium," <I>i.e.</I> "Obituary
Notices:" upon which you display your reasoning powers, by remarking that the name Epitaphium would
have been properly given to the book if the reader had found in it an account of the lives and
writings of deceased authors, but that inasmuch as mention is made of the works of many who were
living when the book was written, and are at this day still living, you wonder why I should have
given the book a title so inappropriate. I think that it must be obvious to your own common sense,
that you might have discovered the title of that book from its contents, without any other help. For
you have read both Greek and Latin biographies of eminent men, and you know that they do not give to
works of this kind the title Epitaphium, but simply "Illustrious Men," <I>e.g.</I> "Illustrious
Generals," or "philosophers, orators, historians, poets," etc., as the case may be. An Epitaphium is
a work written concerning the dead; such as I remember having composed long ago after the decease of
the presbyter Nepotianus, of blessed memory. The book, therefore, of which you speak ought to be
entitled, "Concerning Illustrious Men," or properly, "Concerning Ecclesiastical Writers," although it
is said that by many who were not qualified to make any correction of the title, it has been called
"Concerning Authors."</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>4. You ask, in the second place, my reason for saying, in my commentary on the Epistle to the
Galatians, that Paul could not have rebuked Peter for that which he himself had done,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3951_1610436">475</A></SUP> and could not have censured in another the
dissimulation of which he was himself confessedly guilty; and you affirm that that rebuke of the
apostle was not a manoeuvre of pious policy,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3952_1610641">476</A></SUP> but real; and you say that I ought not to teach
falsehood, but that all things in Scripture are to be received literally as they stand.</P>

<P>To this I answer, in the first place, that your wisdom ought to have suggested the remembrance of
the short preface to my commentaries, saying of my own person, "What then? Am I so foolish and bold
as to promise that which he could not accomplish? By no means; but I have rather, as it seems to me,
with more reserve and hesitation, because feeling the deficiency of my strength, followed the
commentaries of Origen in this matter. For that illustrious man wrote five volumes on the Epistle of
Paul to the Galatians, and has occupied the tenth volume of his <I>Stromata</I> with a short treatise
upon his explanation of the epistle. He also composed several treatises and fragmentary pieces upon
it, which, if they even had stood alone, would have sufficed. I pass over my revered instructor
Didymus<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3954_1611592">477</A></SUP> (blind, it is true, but
quick-sighted in the discernment of spiritual things), and the bishop of Laodicea,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3955_1611994">478</A></SUP> who has recently left the Church, and the early
heretic Alexander, as well as Eusebius of Emesa and Theodorus of Heraclea, who have also left some
brief disquisitions upon this subject. From these works if I were to extract even a few passages, a
work which could not be altogether despised would be produced. Let me therefore frankly say that I
have read all these; and storing up in my mind very many things which they contain, I have dictated
to my amanuensis sometimes what was borrowed from other writers, sometimes what was my own, without
distinctly remembering the method, or the words, or the opinions which belonged to each. I look now
to the Lord in His mercy to grant that my want of skill and experience may not cause the things which
others have well spoken to be lost, or to fail of finding among foreign readers the acceptance with
which they have met in the language in which they were first written. If, therefore, anything in my
explanation has seemed to you to demand correction, it would have been seemly for one of your
learning to inquire first whether what I had written was found in the Greek writers to whom I have
referred; and if they had not advanced the opinion which you censured, you could then with propriety
condemn me for what I gave as my own view, especially seeing that I have in the preface openly
acknowledged that I had followed the commentaries of Origen, and had dictated sometimes the view of
others, sometimes my own, and have written at the end of the chapter with which you find fault: "If
any one be dissatisfied with the interpretation here given, by which it is shown that neither did
Peter sin, nor did Paul rebuke presumptuously a greater than himself, he is bound to show how Paul
could consistently blame in another what he himself did." By which I have made it manifest that I did
not adopt finally and irrevocably that which I had read in these Greek authors, but had propounded
what I had read, leaving to the reader's own judgment whether it should be rejected or approved.</P>

<P>5. You, however, in order to avoid doing what I had asked, have devised a new argument against the
view proposed; maintaining that the Gentiles who had believed in Christ were free from the burden of
the ceremonial law, but that the Jewish converts were under the law, and that Paul, as the teacher of
the Gentiles, rightly rebuked those who kept the law; whereas Peter, who was the chief of the
"circumcision,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3957_1614652">479</A></SUP> was justly rebuked for
commanding the Gentile converts to do that which the converts from among the Jews were alone under
obligation to observe. If this is your opinion, or rather since it is your opinion, that all from
among the Jews who believe are debtors to do the whole law, you ought, as being a bishop of great
fame in the whole world, to publish your doctrine, and labour to persuade all other bishops to agree
with you. As for me in my humble cell,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3958_1615129">480</A></SUP>
along with the monks my fellow-sinners, I do not presume to dogmatize in regard to things of great
moment; I only confess frankly that I read the writings of the Fathers,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3959_1615327">481</A></SUP> and, complying with universal usage, put down in
my commentaries a variety of explanations, that each may adopt from the number given the one which
pleases him. This method, I think, you have found in your reading, and have approved in connection
with both secular literature and the Divine Scriptures.</P>

<P>6. Moreover, as to this explanation which Origen first advanced,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3961_1615710">482</A></SUP> and which all the other commentators after him
have adopted, they bring forward, chiefly for the purpose of answering, the blasphemies of Porphyry,
who accuses Paul of presumption because he dared to reprove Peter and rebuke him to his face, and by
reasoning convict him of having done wrong; that is to say, of being in the very fault which he
himself, who blamed another for transgressing, had committed. What shall I say also of John, who has
long governed the Church of Constantinople, and holding pontifical rank,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3962_1616320">483</A></SUP> who has composed a very large book upon this
paragraph, and has followed the opinion of Origen and of the old expositors? If, therefore, you
censure me as in the wrong, suffer me, I pray you, to be mistaken in company with such men; and when
you perceive that I have so many companions in my error, you will require to produce at least one
partisan in defence of your truth. So much on the interpretation of one paragraph of the Epistle to
the Galatians.</P>

<P>7. Lest, however, I should seem to rest my answer to your reasoning wholly on the number of
witnesses who are on my side, and to use the names of illustrious men as a means of escaping from the
truth, not daring to meet you in argument, I shall briefly bring forward some examples from the
Scriptures.</P>

<P>In the Acts of the Apostles, a voice was heard by Peter, saying unto him, "Rise, Peter, slay and
eat," when all manner of four-footed beasts, and creeping things, and birds of the air, were
presented before him; by which saying it is proved that no man is by nature [ceremonially] unclean,
but that all men are equally welcome to the gospel of Christ. To which Peter answered, "Not so, Lord;
for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean." And the voice spake unto him again the
second time, "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common." Therefore he went to Caesarea, and
having entered the house of Cornelius, "he opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God
is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is
accepted with Him." Thereafter "the Holy! Ghost fell on all them which heard the word; and they of
the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the
Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid
water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he
commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3965_1618444">484</A></SUP> "And the apostles and brethren that were in
Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. And when Peter was come up to
Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, saying, Thou wentest in to men;
uncircumcised, and didst eat with them." To whom he gave a full explanation of the reasonsof his
conduct, and concluded with these words: "Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as He did
unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I, that I could withstand God? When they
heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the
Gentiles granted repentance unto life."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3966_1619131">485</A></SUP>
Again, when, long after this, Paul and Barnabas had come to Antioch, and "having gathered the Church
together, rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how He .had opened the door of faith unto
the Gentiles, certain men which came down from Judea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be
circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no
small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other
of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. And when they
were come to Jerusalem, there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying
that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses." And when there
had been much disputing, Peter rose up, with his wonted readiness, "and said, Men and brethren, ye
know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear
the word of the gospel, and believe. And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
them the Holy Ghost, even as He did unto us; and put no difference between us and them, purifying
their hearts by faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,
which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that, through the grace of the
Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as they. Then all the multitude kept silence;" and to his
opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3967_1620714">486</A></SUP> </P>

<P>8. These quotations should not be tedious to the reader, but useful both to him and to me, as
proving that, even before the Apostle Paul, Peter had come to know that the law was not to be in
force after the gospel was given; nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by
which this was affirmed. Moreover, Peter was of so great authority, that Paul has recorded in his
epistle: "Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen
days."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3969_1621244">487</A></SUP> In the following context, again,
he adds: "Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with
me also. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the
Gentiles;" proving that he had not had confidence in his preaching of the gospel if he had not been
confirmed by the consent of Peter and those who were with him. The next words are, "but privately to
them that were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain." Why did he this
privately rather than in public? Lest offence should be given to the faith of those who from among
the Jews had believed, since they thought that the law was still in force, and that they ought to
join observance of the law with faith in the Lord as their Saviour. Therefore also, when at that time
Peter had come to Antioch (although the Acts of the Apostles do not mention this, but we must believe
Paul's statement), Paul affirms that he "withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. For,
before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he
withdrew, and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. And the other Jews
dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
But when I saw," he says, "that they walked not up-rightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I
said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not
as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3970_1622871">488</A></SUP> etc. No one can doubt, therefore, that the
Apostle Peter was himself the author of that rule with deviation from which he is charged. The cause
of that deviation, moreover, is seen to be fear of the Jews. For the Scripture says, that "at first
he did eat with the Gentiles, but that when certain had come from James he withdrew, and separated
himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision." Now he feared the Jews, to whom he had been
appointed apostle, lest by occasion of the Gentiles they should go back from the faith in Christ;
imitating the Good Shepherd in his concern lest he should lose the flock committed to him.</P>

<P>9. As I have shown, therefore, that Peter was thoroughly aware of the abrogation of the law of
Moses, but was compelled by fear to pretend to observe it, let us now see whether Paul, who accuses
another, ever did anything of the same kind himself. We read in the same book: "Paul passed through
Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain
disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman which was a Jewess, and believed; but
his father! was a Greek: which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him, because of the Jews which
were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3972_1624300">489</A></SUP> O blessed Apostle Paul, who hadst rebuked Peter
for dissimulation, because he withdrew himself from the Gentiles through fear of the Jews who' came
from James, why art thou, notwithstanding thine own doctrine, compelled to circumcise Timothy, the
son of a Gentile, nay more, a Gentile himself (for he was not a Jew, having not been circumcised)?
Thou wilt answer, "Because of the Jews which are in these quarters?" If, then, thou forgiveth thyself
the circumcision of a disciple coming from the Gentiles, forgive Peter also, who has precedence above
thee, his doing some things of the same kind through fear of the believing Jews. Again, it is
written: "Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren,
and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea,
for he had a vow."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3973_1625192">490</A></SUP> Be it granted that he
was compelled through fear of the Jews in the other case to do what he was unwilling to do; wherefore
did he let his hair grow in accordance with a vow of his own making, and afterwards, when in
Cenchrea, shave his head according to the law, as the Nazarites, who had given themselves by vow to
God, were wont to do, according to the law of Moses?</P>

<P>10. But these things are small when compared with what follows. The sacred historian Luke further
relates: "And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly;" and the day
following, James, and all the elders who were with him, having expressed their approbation of his
gospel, said to Paul: "Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and
they are all zealous of the law: anti they are informedof thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which
are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children,
neither to walk after the customs. What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together: for
they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have
a vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may
shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. Then Paul took the men,
and the next day purifying himself with them, entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment
of the days of purification, until an offering should be offered for every one of them."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3975_1626865">491</A></SUP> O Paul, here again let me question thee: Why
didst thou shave thy head, why didst thou walk barefoot according to I Jewish ceremonial law, why
didst thou offer sacrifices, why were victims slain for thee according to the law? Thou wilt answer,
doubtless, "To avoid giving offence to those of the Jews who had believed." To gain the Jews, thou
didst pretend to be a Jew; and James and all the other elders taught thee this dissimulation. But
thou didst not succeed in escaping, after all. For when thou wast on the point of being killed in a
tumult which had arisen, thou wast rescued by the chief captain of the band, and was sent by him to
Caesarea, guarded by a careful escort of soldiers, lest the Jews should kill thee as a dissembler,
and a destroyer of the law; and from Caesarea coming to Rome, thou didst, in thine own hired house,
preach Christ to both Jews and Gentiles, and thy. testimony was sealed under Nero's sword.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3976_1627820">492</A></SUP> </P>

<P>11. We have learned, therefore, that through fear of the Jews both Peter and Paul alike pretended
that they observed the precepts of the law. How could Paul have the assurance and effrontery to
reprove in another what he had done himself? I at least, or, I should rather say, others before me,
have given such explanation of the matter as they deemed best, not defending the use of falsehood in
the interest of religion,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3978_1628280">493</A></SUP> as you charge
them with doing, but teaching the honourable exercise of a wise discretion;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3979_1628399">494</A></SUP> seeking both to show the wisdom of the apostles,
and to restrain the shameless blasphemies of Porphyry, who says that Peter and Paul quarrelled with
each other in childish rivalry, and affirms that Paul had been inflamed with envy on account of the
excellences of Peter, and had written boastfully of things which he either had not done, or, if he
did them, had done with inexcusable presumption, reproving in another that which he himself had done.
They, in answering him, gave the best interpretation of the passage which they could find; what
interpretation have you to propound? Surely you must intend to say something better than they have
said, since you have rejected the opinion of the ancient commentators.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>12. You say in your letter: "You do not require me to teach you in what sense the apostle says,
`To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;'<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3982_1629313">495</A></SUP> and other such things in the same passage, which
are to be ascribed to the compassion of pitying love, not to the artifices of intentional deceit. For
he that ministers to the sick becomes as if he were sick himself, not indeed falsely pretending to be
under the fever, but considering with the mind of one truly sympathizing what he would wish done for
himself if he were in the sick man's place. Paul was indeed a Jew; and when he had become a
Christian, he had not abandoned those Jewish sacraments which that people had received in the right
way, and for a certain appointed time. Therefore, even when he was an apostle of Christ, he took part
in observing these, but with this view, that he might show that they were in no wise hurtful to those
who, even after they had believed in Christ, desired to retain the ceremonies which by the law they
had learned from their fathers; provided only that they did not build on these their hope of
salvation, since the salvation which was fore-shadowed in these has now been brought in by the Lord
Jesus." The sum of your whole argument, which you have expanded into a most prolix dissertation, is
this, that Peter did not err in supposing that the law was binding on those who from among the Jews
had believed, but departed from the right course in this, that he compelled the Gentile converts to
conform to Jewish observances. Now, if he compelled them, it was not by use of authority as a
teacher, but by the example of his own practice. And Paul, according to your view, did not protest
against what Peter had done personally, but asked wherefore Peter would compel those who were from
among the Gentiles to conform to Jewish observances.</P>

<P>13. The matter in debate, therefore, or I should rather say your opinion regarding it, is summed
up in this: that since the preaching of the gospel of Christ, the believing Jews do well in observing
the precepts of the law, <I>i.e.</I> in offering sacrifices as Paul did, in circumcising their
children, as Paul did in the case of Timothy, and keeping the Jewish Sabbath, as all the Jews have
been accustomed to do. If this be true, we fall into the heresy of Cerinthus and Ebion, who, though
believing in Christ, were anathematized by the fathers for this one error, that they mixed up the
ceremonies of the law with the gospel of Christ, and professed their faith in that which was new,
without letting go what was old. Why do I speak of the Ebionites, who make pretensions to the name of
Christian? In our own day there exists a sect among the Jews throughout all the synagogues of the
East, which is called the sect of the Minei, and is even now condemned by the Pharisees. The
adherents to this sect are known commonly as Nazarenes; they believe in Christ the Son of God, born
of the Virgin Mary; and they say that He who suffered under Pontius Pilate and rose again, is the
same as the one in whom we believe. But while they desire to be both Jews and Christians, they are
neither the one nor the other. I therefore beseech you, who think that you are called upon to heal my
slight wound, which is no more, so to speak, than a prick or scratch from a needle, to devote your
skill in the healing art to this grievous wound, which has been opened by a spear driven home with
the impetus of a javelin. For there is surely no proportion between the culpability of him who
exhibits the various opinions held by the fathers in a commentary on Scripture, and the guilt of him
who reintroduces within the Church a most pestilential heresy. If, however, there is for us no
alternative but to receive the Jews into the Church, along with the usages prescribed by their law;
if, in short, it shall be declared lawful for them to continue in the Churches of Christ what they
have been accustomed to practise in the synagogues of Satan, I will tell you my opinion of the
matter: they will not become Christians, but they will make us Jews.</P>

<P>14. For what Christian will submit to hear what is said in your letter? "Paul was indeed a Jew;
and when he had become a Christian, he had not abandoned those Jewish sacraments which that people
had received in the right way, and for a certain appointed time. Therefore, even when he was an
apostle of Christ, he took part in observing these; but with this view, that he might show that they
were in no wise hurtful to those who, even after they had believed in Christ, desired to retain the
ceremonies which by the law they had learned from their fathers." Now I implore you to hear patiently
my complaint. Paul, even when he was an apostle of Christ, observed Jewish ceremonies; and you affirm
that they are in no wise hurtful to those who wish to retain them as they had received them from
their fathers by the law. I, on the contrary, shall maintain, and, though the world were to protest
against my view, I may boldly declare that .the Jewish ceremonies are to Christians both hurtful and
fatal; and that whoever observes them, whether he be Jew or Gentile originally, is cast into the pit
of perdition. "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3985_1634439">496</A></SUP> that is, to both Jew and
Gentile; for if the Jew be excepted, He is not the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth. Moreover, we read in the Gospel, "The law and the prophets were until John the
Baptist."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3986_1634684">497</A></SUP> Also, in another place:
"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He had not only broken the Sabbath, but said
also that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3987_1634910">498</A></SUP> Again: "Of His fulness have all we received, and
grace for grace; for the law was given Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3988_1635067">499</A></SUP> Instead of the grace of the law which has passed
away, we have received the grace of the gospel which is abiding; and instead of the shadows and types
of the old dispensation, the truth has come by Jesus Christ. Jeremiah also prophesied thus in God's
name: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of
Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers,
in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3989_1635619">500</A></SUP> Observe what the prophet says, not to Gentiles,
who had not been partakers in any former covenant, but to the Jewish nation. He who has given them
the law by Moses, promises in place of it the new covenant of the gospel, that they might no longer
live in the oldness of the letter, but in the newness of the spirit. Paul himself, moreover, in
connection with whom the discussion of this question has arisen, delivers such sentiments as these
frequently, of which I subjoin only a few, as I desire to be brief: "Behold, I Paul say unto you,
that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." Again: "Christ is become of no effect
unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace." Again: "If ye be led
of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3990_1636427">501</A></SUP>
From which it is evident that he has not the Holy Spirit who submits to the law, not, as our fathers
affirmed the apostles to have done, feignedly, under the promptings of a wise discretion,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3991_1636643">502</A></SUP> but, as you suppose to have been the case,
sincerely. As to the quality of these legal precepts, let us learn from God's own teaching: "I gave
them," He says, "statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3992_1636898">503</A></SUP> I say these things, not that I may, like
Manichaeus and Marcion, destroy the law, which I know on the testimony of the apostle to be both holy
and spiritual; but because when "faith came," and the fulness of times, "God sent forth His Son, made
of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of sons,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3993_1637281">504</A></SUP> and might live no
longer under the law as our schoolmaster, but under the Heir, who has now attained to full age, and
is Lord.</P>

<P>15. It is further said in your letter: "The thing, therefore, which he rebuked in Peter was not
his observing the customs handed down from his fathers, which Peter, if he wished, might do without
being chargeable with deceit or inconsistency."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3995_1637670">505</A></SUP> Again I say: Since you are a bishop, a teacher
in the Churches of Christ, if you would prove what you assert, receive any Jew who, after having
become a Christian, circumcises any son that may be born to him, observes the Jewish Sabbath,
abstains from meats which God has created to be used with thanksgiving, and on the evening of the
fourteenth day of the first month slays a paschal lamb; and when you have done this, or rather, have
refused to do it (for I know that you are a Christian, and will not be guilty of a profane action),
you will be constrained, whether willingly or unwillingly, to renounce your opinion; and then you
will know that it is a more difficult work to reject the opinion of others than to establish your
own. Moreover, lest perhaps we should not believe your statement, or, I should rather say, understand
it (for it is often the case that a discourse unduly extended is not intelligible, and is less
censured by the unskilled in discussion because its weakness is not so easily perceived), you
inculcate your opinion by reiterating the statement in these words: "Paul had forsaken everything
peculiar to the Jews that was evil, especially this, that `being ignorant of God's righteousness, and
going about to establish their own righteousness, they had not submitted themselves to the
righteousness of God.'<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3996_1639042">506</A></SUP> In this, moreover,
he differed from them, that after the passion and resurrection of Christ, in whom had been given and
made manifest the mystery of grace, according to the order of Melchizedek, they still considered it
binding on them to celebrate, not out of mere reverence for old customs, but as necessary to
salvation, the sacraments of the old dispensation; which were indeed at one time necessary, else had
it been unprofitable and vain for the Maccabees to suffer martyrdom as they did for their adherence
to them.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3997_1639584">507</A></SUP> Lastly, in this also Paul
differed from the Jews, that they persecuted the Christian preachers of grace as enemies of the law.
These, and all similar errors and sins, he declares that he counted but loss and dung, that he might
win Christ."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn39.htm#P3998_1639848">508</A></SUP> </P>

<P>16. We have learned from you what evil things peculiar to the Jews Paul had abandoned; let us now
learn from your teaching what good things which were Jewish he retained. You will reply: "The
ceremonial observances in which they continued to follow the practice of their fathers, in the way in
which these were complied, with by Paul himself, without believing them to be at all necessary to
salvation." I do not fully understand what you mean by the words, "without believing them to be at
all necessary to salvation." For if they do not contribute to salvation, why are they observed? And
if they must be observed, they by all means contribute to salvation; especially seeing that, because
of observing them, some have been made martyrs: for they would not be observed unless they
contributed to salvation. For they are not things indifferent-neither good nor bad, as philosophers
say. Self-control is good, self-indulgence is bad: between these, and indifferent, as having no moral
quality, are such things as walking, blowing one's nose, expectorating phlegm, etc. Such an action is
neither good nor bad; for whether you do it or leave it undone, it does riot affect your standing as
righteous or unrighteous. But the observance of legal ceremonies is not a thing indifferent; it is
either good or bad. You say it is good. I affirm it to be bad, and bad not only when done by Gentile
converts, but also when done by Jews who have believed. In this passage you fall, if I am not
mistaken, into one error while avoiding another. For while you guard yourself against the blasphemies
of Porphyry, you become entangled in the snares of Ebion; pronouncing that the law is binding on
those who from among the Jews have believed. Perceiving, again, that what you have said is a
dangerous doctrine, you attempt to qualify it by words which are only superfluous: viz., "The law
must be observed not from any belief, such as prompted the Jews to keep it, that this is necessary to
salvation, and not in any misleading dissimulation such as Paul reproved in Peter."</P>

<P>17. Peter therefore pretended to keep the law; but this censor of Peter boldly observed the things
prescribed by the law. The next words of your letter are these: "For if Paul observed these
sacraments in order, by pretending to be a Jew, to gain the Jews, why did he not also take part with
the Gentiles in heathen sacrifices, when to them that were without law he became as without law, that
he might gain them also? The explanation is found in this, that he took part in the Jewish rites as
being himself a Jew; and that when he said all this which I have quoted, he meant not that he
pretended to be what he was not, but that he felt with true compassion that he must bring such help
to them as would be needful for himself if he were involved in their error.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4001_1642715">509</A></SUP> Herein he exercised not the subtlety of a
deceiver, but the sympathy of a compassionate deliverer." A triumphant vindication of Paul! You prove
that he did not pretend to share the error of the Jews, but was actually involved in it; and that he
refused to imitate Peter in a course of deception, dissembling through fear of the Jews what he
really was, but without reserve freely avowed himself to be a Jew. Oh, unheard of! compassion of the
apostle! In seeking to make the Jews Christians, he himself became a Jew! For he could not have
persuaded the luxurious to become temperate if he had not himself become luxurious like them; and
could not have brought help, in his compassion, as you say, to the wretched, otherwise than by
experiencing in his own person their wretchedness! Truly wretched, and worthy of most compassionate
lamentation, are those who, carried away by vehemence of disputation, and by love for the law which
has been abolished, have made Christ'sapostle to be a Jew. Nor is there, after all, a great
difference between my opinion and yours: for I say that both Peter and Paul, through fear of the
believing Jews, practised, or rather pretended tb practise, the precepts of the Jewish law; whereas
you maintain that they did this out of pity, "not with the subtlety of a deceiver, but with the
sympathy of a compassionate deliverer." But by both this is equally admitted, that (whether from fear
or from pity) they pretended to be what they were not. As to your argument against our view, that he
ought to have become to the Gentiles a Gentile, if to the Jews he became a Jew, this favours our
opinion rather than yours: for as he did not actually become a Jew, so he did not actually become a
heathen; and as he did not actually become a heathen, so he did not actually become a Jew. His
conformity to the Gentiles consisted in this, that he received as Christians the uncircumcised who
believed in Christ, and left them free to use without scruple meats which the Jewish law prohibited;
but not, as you suppose, in taking part in their worship of idols. For "in Christ Jesus, neither
circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but the keeping of the commandments of
God."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4002_1644949">510</A></SUP> </P>

<P>18. I ask you, therefore, and with all urgency press the request, that you forgive me this humble
attempt at a discussion of the matter; and wherein I have transgressed, lay the blame upon yourself
who compelled me to write in reply, and who made me out to be as blind as Stesichorus. And do not
bring the reproach of teaching the practice of lying upon me who am" a follower of Christ, who said,
"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4004_1645417">511</A></SUP>
It is impossible for me, who am a worshipper of the Truth, to bow under the yoke of falsehood.
Moreover, refrain from stirring up against me the unlearned crowd who esteem you as their bishop, and
regard with the respect due the priestly office the orations which you deliver in the church, but who
esteem lightly an old decrepit man like me, courting the retirement of a monastery far from the busy
haunts of men; and seek others who may be more filly instructed or corrected by you. For the sound of
your Voice can scarcely reach me, who am so far separated from you by sea and land. And if you happen
to write me a letter, Italy and Rome are sure to be acquainted with its contents long before it is
brought to me, to whom alone it ought to be sent.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>19. In another letter you ask why a former translation which I made of some of the canonical books
was carefully marked with asterisks and obelisks, whereas I afterwards published a translation
without these. You must pardon my saying that you seem to me not to understand the matter: for the
former translation is from the Septuagint; and wherever obelisks are placed, they are designed to
indicate that the Seventy have said more than is found in the Hebrew. But the asterisks indicate what
has been added by Origen from the version of Theodotion. In that version I was translating from the
Greek: but in the later version, translating from the Hebrew itself, I have expressed what I
understood it to mean, being careful to preserve rather the exact sense than the order of the words.
I am surprised that you do not read the books of the Seventy translators in the genuine form in which
they were originally given to the world, but as they have been corrected, or rather corrupted, by
Origen, with his obelisks and asterisks; and that you refuse to follow the translation, however
feeble, which has been given by a Christian man, especially seeing that Origen borrowed the things
which he has added from the edition of a man who, after the passion of Christ, was a Jew and a
blasphemer. Do you wish to be a true admirer and partisan of the Seventy translators? Then do not
read what you find under the asterisks; rather erase them from the volumes, that you may approve
yourself indeed a follower of the ancients. If, however, you do this, you will be compelled to find
fault with all the libraries of the Churches; for you will scarcely find more than one Ms. here and
there which has not these interpolations.</P>

<P>Chap. VI.</P>

<P>20. A few words now as to your remark that I ought not to have given a translation, after this had
been already done by the ancients; and the novel syllogism which you use: "The passages of which the
Seventy have given an interpretation were either obscure or plain. If they were obscure, it is
believed that you are as likely to have been mistaken as the othersif they were plain, it is not
believed that the Seventy could have been mistaken."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4009_1648364">512</A></SUP> </P>

<P>All the commentators who have been our predecessors in the Lord in the work of expounding the
Scriptures, have expounded either what was obscure or what was plain. If some passages were obscure,
how could you, after them, presume to discuss that which they were not able to explain? If the
passages were plain, it was a waste of time for you to have undertaken to treat of that which could
not possibly have escaped them. This syllogism applies with peculiar force to the book of Psalms, in
the interpretation of which Greek commentators have written many volumes: viz. 1<I>st</I>, Origen:
2<I>d</I>, Eusebius of Caesarea; 3<I>d</I>, Theodorus of Heraclea; 4<I>th</I>, Asterius of
Scythopolis; 5<I>th</I>, Apollinaris of Laodicea; and, 6<I>th</I>, Didymus of Alexandria. There are
said to be minor works on selections from the Psalms, but I speak at present of the whole book.
Moreover, among Latin writers the bishops Hilary of Poitiers, and Eusebius of Verceil, have
translated Origen and Eusebius of Caesarea, the former of whom has in some things been followed by
our own Ambrose. Now, I put it to your wisdom to answer why you, after all the labours of so many and
so competent interpreters, differ from them in your exposition of some passages? If the Psalms are
obscure, it must be believed that you are as likely to be mistaken as others; if they are plain, it
is incredible that these others could have fallen into mistake. In either case, your exposition has
been, by your own showing, an unnecessary labour; and on the same principle, no one would ever
venture to speak on any subject after others have pronounced their opinion, and no one would be at
liberty to write anything regarding that which another has once handled, however important the matter
might be.</P>

<P>It is, however, more in keeping with your enlightened judgment, to grant to all others the liberty
which you tolerate in yourself for in my attempt to translate into Latin, for the benefit of those
who speak the same language with myself, the corrected Greek version of the Scriptures, I have
laboured not to supersede what has been long esteemed, but only to bring prominently forward those
things which have been either omitted or tampered with by the Jews, in order that Latin readers might
know what is found in the original Hebrew. If any one is averse to reading it, none compels him
against his will. Let him drink with satisfaction the old wine, and despise my new wine, <I>i.e.</I>
the sentences which I have published in explanation of former writers, with the design of making more
obvious by my remarks what in them seemed to me to be obscure.</P>

<P>As to the principles which ought to be followed in the interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures,
they are stated in the book which I have written,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4013_1651129">513</A></SUP> and in all the introductions to the divine books
which I have in my edition prefixed to each; and to these I think it sufficient to refer the prudent
reader. And since you approve of my labours in revising the translation of the New Testament, as you
say,-giving me at the same time this as your reason, that very many are acquainted with the Greek
language, and are therefore competent judges of my work,-it would have been but fair to have given me
credit for the same fidelity in the Old Testament; for I have not followed my own imagination, but
have rendered the divine words as I found them. understood by those who speak the Hebrew language. If
you have any doubt of this in any passage, ask the Jews what is the meaning of the original.</P>

<P>21. Perhaps you will say, "What if the Jews decline to answer, or choose to impose upon us?" Is it
conceivable that the whole multitude of Jews will agree together to be silent if asked about my
translation, and that none shall be found that has any knowledge of the Hebrew language? Or will they
all imitate those Jews whom you mention as having, in some little town, conspired to injure my
reputation? For in your letter you put together the following story:-"A certain bishop, one of our
brethren, having introduced in the Church over which he presides the reading of your version, came
upon a word in the book of the prophet Jonah, of which you have given a very different rendering from
that which had been of old familiar to the senses and memory of all the worshippers, and had been
chanted for so many generations in the Church. Thereupon arose such a tumult in the congregation,
especially among the Greeks, correcting what had been read, and denouncing the translation as false,
that the bishop was compelled to ask the testimony of the Jewish residents (it was in the town of
Oea). These, whether from ignorance or from spite, answered that the words in the Hebrew Mss. were
correctly rendered in the Greek version, and in the Latin one taken from it. What further need I say?
The man was compelled to correct your version in that passage as if it had been falsely translated,
as he desired not to be left without a congregation,-a calamity which he narrowly escaped. From this
case we also are led to think that you may be occasionally mistaken."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4015_1653471">514</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Chap. VII.</P>

<P>22. You tell me that I have given a wrong translation of some word in Jonah, and that a worthy
bishop narrowly escaped losing his charge through the clamorous tumult of his people, which was
caused by the different rendering of this one word. At the same time, you withhold from me what the
word was which I have mistranslated; thus taking away the possibility of my saying anything in my own
vindication, lest my reply should be fatal to your objection. Perhaps it is the old dispute about the
gourd which has been revived, after slumbering for many long years since the illustrious man, who in
that day combined in his own person the ancestral honours of the Cornelii and of Asinius
Pollio,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4018_1654212">515</A></SUP> brought against me the charge of
giving in my translation the word "ivy" instead of "gourd" I have already given a sufficient answer
to this in my commentary on Jonah. At present, I deem it enough to say that in that passage, where
the Septuagint has "gourd," and Aquila and the others have rendered the word "ivy" (<FONT
FACE='SPIonic'>ki/ssoj</FONT>), the Hebrew Ms. has "ciceion," which is in the Syriac tongue, as now
spoken, "ciceia." It is a kind of shrub having large leaves like a vine, and when planted it quickly
springs up to the size of a small tree, standing upright by its own stem, without requiring any
support of canes or poles, as both gourds and ivy do. If, therefore, in translating word for word, I
had put the word "ciceia," no one would know what it meant; if I had used the word "gourd," I would
have said what is not found in the Hebrew. I therefore put down "ivy," that I might not differ from
all other translators. But if your Jews said, either through malice or ignorance, as you yourself
suggest, that the word is in the Hebrew text which is found in the Greek and Latin versions, it is
evident that they were either unacquainted with Hebrew, or have been pleased to say what was not
true, in order to make sport of the gourd-planters.</P>

<P>In closing this letter, I beseech you to have some consideration for a soldier who is now old and
has long retired from active service, and not to force him to take the field and again expose his
life to the chances of war. Do you, who are young, and who have been appointed to the conspicuous
seat of pontifical dignity, give yourself to teaching the people, and enrich Rome with new stores
from fertile Africa.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4020_1656199">516</A></SUP> I am contented to

<P>1. Hear, O Donatists, what the Catholic Church says to you: "O ye sons of men, how long will ye be
slow of heart? why will ye love vanity, and follow after lies?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4025_1656574">517</A></SUP> Why have you severed yourselves, by the heinous
impiety of schism, from the unity of the whole world? You give heed to the falsehoods concerning the
surrendering of the divine books to persecutors, which men who are either deceiving you, or are
themselves deceived, utter in order that you may die in a state of heretical separation: and you do
not give heed to what these divine books themselves proclaim, in order that you may live in the peace
of the Catholic Church. Wherefore do you lend an open ear to the words of men who tell you things
which they have never been able to prove, and are deaf to the voice of God speaking thus: "The Lord
hath said unto me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee
the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession"?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4026_1657430">518</A></SUP> "To Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
He saith not, `And to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, `And to thy seed,' which is Christ."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4027_1657593">519</A></SUP> And the promise to which the apostle refers is
this: "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4028_1657728">520</A></SUP> Therefore lift up the eyes of your souls, and
see how in the whole world all nations are blessed in Abraham's seed. Abraham, in his day, believed
what was not yet seen; but you who see it refuse to believe what has been fulfilled.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4029_1657981">521</A></SUP> The Lord's death was the ransom of the world; He
paid the price for the whole world; and you do not dwell in concord with the whole world, as would be
for your advantage, but stand apart and strive contentiously to destroy the whole world, to your own
loss. Hear now what is said in the Psalm concerning this ransom: "They pierced my hands and my feet.
I may tell all my bones; they look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and cast lots
upon my vesture."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4030_1658535">522</A></SUP> Wherefore will you be
guilty of dividing the garments of the Lord, and not hold in common with the whole world that coat of
charity, woven from above throughout, which even His executioners did not rend? In the same Psalm we
read that the whole world holds this, for he says: "All the ends of the world shall remember and turn
unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee; for the kingdom is the
Lord's, and He is the Governor among the nations."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4031_1659043">523</A></SUP> Open the ears of your soul, and hear: "The
mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth, from the rising of the sun unto the
going down thereof; out of Zion, the perfection of beauty."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4032_1659268">524</A></SUP> If you do not wish to understand this, hear the
gospel from the Lord's own lips, how He said: "All things must be fulfilled which were written in the
Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Him; and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4033_1659623">525</A></SUP> The words in the Psalm, "the earth from the
rising of the sun unto the going down thereof," correspond to these in the Gospel, "among all
nations;" and as He said in the Psalm, "from Zion, the perfection of beauty," He has said in the
Gospel, "beginning at Jerusalem."</P>

<P>2. Your imagination that you are separating yourselves, before the time of the harvest, from the
tares which are mixed with the wheat, proves that you are only tares. For if you were wheat, you
would bear with the tares, and not separate yourselves from that which is growing in Christ's field.
Of the tares, indeed, it has been said, "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
cold;" but of the wheat it is said, "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
saved."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4035_1660409">526</A></SUP> What grounds have you for
believing that the tares have increased and filled the world, and that the wheat has decreased, and
is found now in Africa alone? You claim to be Christians, and you disclaim the authority of Christ.
He said, "Let both grow together till the harvest;" He said not, "Let the wheat decrease, and let the
tares multiply." He said, "The field is the world;" He said not, "The field is Africa." He said, "The
harvest is the end of the world;" He said not, "The harvest is the time of Donatus." He said, "The
reapers are the angels;" He said not, "The reapers are the captains of the Circumcelliones."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4036_1661058">527</A></SUP> But you, by charging the good wheat with being
tares, have proved yourselves to be tares; and what is worse, you have prematurely separated
yourselves from the wheat. For some of your predecessors, in whose impious schism you obstinately
remain, delivered up to persecutors the sacred Mss. and the vessels of the Church (as may be seen in
municipal records<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4037_1661442">528</A></SUP> ); others of them
passed over the fault which these men confessed, and remained in communion with them; and both
parties having come together to Carthage as an infatuated faction, condemned others without a
hearing, on the charge of that fault which they had agreed, so far as they themselves were concerned,
to forgive, and then set up a bishop against the ordained bishop, and erected an altar against the
altar already recognised. Afterwards they sent to the Emperor Constantine a letter begging that
bishops of churches beyond the sea should be appointed to arbitrate between the bishops of Africa.
When the judges whom they sought were granted, and at Rome had given their decision, they refused to
submit to it, and complained to the Emperor or against the bishops as having judged unrighteously.
From the sentence of another bench of bishops sent to Arles to try the case, they appealed to the
Emperor himself. When he had heard them, and they had been proved guilty of calumny, they still
persisted in their wickedness. Awake to the interest of your salvation! love peace, and return to
unity! Whensoever you desire it, we are ready to recite in detail the events to which we have
referred.</P>

<P>3. He is the associate of wicked men who consents to the deeds of wicked men; not he who suffers
the tares to grow in the Lord's field unto the harvest, or the chaff to remain until the final
winnowing time. If you hate those who do evil, shake yourselves free from the crime of schism. If you
really feared to associate with the wicked, you would not for so many years have permitted
Optatus<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4039_1663105">529</A></SUP> to remain among you when he was
living in the most flagrant sin. And as you now give him the name of martyr, you must, if you are
consistent, give him for whom he died the name of Christ. Finally, wherein has the Christian world
offended you, from which you have insanely and wickedly cut yourselves off? and what claim upon your
esteem have those followers of Maximianus, whom you have received back with honour after they had
been condemned by you, and violently cast forth by warrant of the civil authorities from their
churches? Wherein has the peace of Christ offended you, that you resist it by separating yourselves
from those whom you calumniate? and wherein has the peace of Donatus earned your favour, that to
promote it you receive back those whom you condemned? Felicianus of Musti is now one of you. We have
read concerning him, that he was formerly condemned by your council, and afterwards accused by you at
the bar of the proconsul, and in the town of Musti was attacked as is stated in the municipal
records.</P>

<P>4. If the surrendering of the sacred books to destruction is a crime which, in the case of the
king who burned the book of Jeremiah, God punished with death as a prisoner of war,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4041_1664544">530</A></SUP> how much greater is the guilt of schism! For
those authors of schism to whom you have compared the followers of Maximianus, the earth opening,
swallowed up alive.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4042_1664734">531</A></SUP> Why, then, do you
object against us the charge of surrendering the sacred books which you do not prove, and at the same
time both condemn and welcome back those among yourselves who are schismatics? If you are proved to
be in the right by the fact that you have suffered persecution from the Emperor, a still stronger
claim than yours must be that of the followers of Maximianus, whom you have yourselves persecuted by
the help of judges sent to you by Catholic emperors. If you alone have baptism, what weight do you
attach to the baptism administered by followers of Maximianus in the case of those whom Felicianus
baptized while he was under your sentence of condemnation, who came along with him when he was
afterwards restored by you? Let your bishops answer these questions to your laity at least, if they
will not debate with us; and do you, as you value your salvation, consider what kind of doctrine that
must be about which they refuse to enter into discussion with us. If the wolves have prudence enough
to keep out of the way of the shepherds, why have the flock so lost their prudence, that they go into
the dens of the wolves?</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Felix and Hilarinus, My Lordsmost Beloved, and Brethren Worthy of All Honour, Augustin
Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I do not wonder to see the minds of believers disturbed by Satan, whom resist, continuing
in the hope which rests on the promises of God, who cannot lie, who has not only condescended to
promise in eternity rewards to us who believe and hope in Him, and who persevere in love unto the
end, but has also foretold that in time offences by which our faith must be tried and proved shall
not be wanting; for He said, "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold;" but He
added immediately, "and he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4048_1666613">532</A></SUP> Why, therefore, should it seem strange that men
bring calumnies against the servants of God, and being unable to turn them aside from an upright
life, endeavour to blacken their reputation, seeing that they do not cease uttering blasphemies daily
against God, the Lord of these servants, if they are displeased by anything in which the execution of
His righteous and secret counsel is contrary to their desire? Wherefore I appeal to your wisdom, my
lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of all honour, and exhort you to exercise your minds in the
way which best becomes Christians, setting over against the empty calumnies and groundless suspicions
of men the written word of God, which has foretold that these things should come, and has warned us
to meet them with fortitude.</P>

<P>2. Let me therefore say in a few words to your Charity, that the presbyter Boniface has not been
discovered by me to be guilty of any crime, and that I have never believed, and do not yet believe,
any charge brought against him. How, then, could I order his name to be deleted from the roll of
presbyters, when filled with alarm by that word of our Lord in the gospel: "With what judgment ye
judge ye shall be judged"?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4050_1667837">533</A></SUP> For, seeing
that the dispute which has arisen between him and Spes has by their consent been submitted to divine
arbitration in a way which, if you desire it, can be made known to you,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4051_1668043">534</A></SUP> who am I, that I should presume to anticipate
the divine award by deleting or passing over his name? As a bishop, I ought not rashly to suspect
him; and as being only a man, I cannot decide infallibly concerning things which are hidden from me.
Even in secular matters, when an appeal has been made to a higher authority, all procedure is sisted
while the case awaits the decision from which there is no appeal; because if anything were changed
while the matter is depending on his arbitration, this would be an insult to the higher tribunal. And
how great the distance between even the highest human authority and the divine!</P>

<P>May the mercy of the Lord our God never forsake you, my lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of
all honour.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Most Beloved Brethren, the Clergy, Elders, and People of the Church of Hippo, Whom
I Serve in the Love of Christ, I, Augustin, Send Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Would that you, giving. earnest heed to the word of God, did not require counsel of mine
to support you under whatsoever offences may arise! Would that your comfort rather came from Him by
whom we also are comforted; who has foretold not only the good things which He designs to give to
those who are holy and faithful, but also the evil things in which this world is to abound; and has
caused these to be written, in order that we may expect the blessings which are to follow the end of
this world with a certainty not less complete than that which attends our present experience of the
evils which had been predicted as coming before the end of the world! Wherefore also the apostle
says, "Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hone "<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4058_1669994">535</A></SUP> And wherefore did our Lord Himself judge it
necessary not only to say, "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4059_1670165">536</A></SUP> which shall come to pass after
the end of the world, but also to exclaim, "Woe unto the world because of offences!"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4060_1670304">537</A></SUP> if not to prevent us from flattering ourselves
with the idea that we can reach the mansions of eternal felicity, unless we have overcome the
temptation to yield when exercised by the afflictions of time? Why was it necessary for Him to say,
"Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold," if not in order that those of whom
He spoke in the next sentence," but he that shall endure to the end shall be saved,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4061_1670756">538</A></SUP> might, when they saw love waxing cold through
abounding iniquity, be saved from being put to confusion, or filled with fear, or crushed with grief
about such things, as if they were strange and unlooked for, and might rather, through witnessing the
events which had been predicted as appointed to occur before the end, be assisted in patiently
enduring unto the end, so as to obtain after the end the reward of reigning in peace in that life
which has no end?</P>

<P>2. Wherefore, beloved, in regard to that scandal by which some are troubled concerning the
presbyter Boniface, I do not say to you that you are not to be grieved for it; for in men who do not
grieve for such things the love of Christ is not, whereas those who take pleasure in such things are
filled with the malice of the devil. Not; however, that anything has come to our knowledge which
deserves censure in the presbyter aforesaid, but that two in our house,are so situated that one of
them must be regarded as beyond all doubt wicked; and though the conscience of the other be not
defiled, his good name is forfeited in the eyes of some, and suspected by others. Grieve for these
things, for they are to be lamented; but do not so grieve as to let your love grow cold, and
yourselves be indifferent to holy living. Let it rather burn the more vehemently in the exercise of
prayer to God, that if your presbyter is guiltless (which I am the more inclined to believe, because,
when he had discovered the immoral and vile proposal of the other, he would neither consent to it nor
conceal it), a divine decision may speedily restore him to the exercise of his official duties with
his innocence vindicated; and that if, on the other hand, knowing himself to be guilty, which I dare
not suspect, he has deliberately tried to destroy the good name of another when he could not corrupt
his morals, as he charges his accuser with having done, God may not permit him to hide his
wickedness, so that the thing which men cannot discover may be revealed by the judgment of God, to
the conviction of the one or of the other.</P>

<P>3. For when this case had long disquieted me, and I could find no way of convicting either of the
two as guilty, although I rather inclined to believe the presbyter innocent, I had at first resolved
to leave both in the hand of God, without deciding the case, until something should be done by the
one of whom I had suspicion, giving just and unquestionable reasons for his expulsion: from our
house. But when he was labouring most earnestly to obtain promotion to the rank of the clergy, either
on the spot from myself, or elsewhere through letter of recommendation from me, and I could on no
account be induced either to lay hands in the act of ordination upon one of whom I thought so ill, or
to consent to introduce him through commendation of mine to any brother for the same purpose, he
began to act more violently demanding that if he was not to be promoted to clerical orders, Boniface
should not be permitted to retain his status as a presbyter. This demand having been made, when I
perceived that Boniface was unwilling that, through doubts as to his holiness of life, offence should
be given to any who were weak and inclined to suspect him, and that he was ready to suffer the loss
of his honour among men rather than vainly persist even to the disquieting of the Church in a
contention the very nature of which made it impossible for him to prove his innocence (of which he
was conscious) to the satisfaction of those who did not know him, or were in doubt or prone to
suspicion in regard to him, I fixed upon the following as a means of discovering the truth. Both
pledged themselves in a solemn compact to go to a holy place, where the more awe-inspiring works of
God might much more readily make manifest the evil of which either of them was conscious, and compel
the guilty to confess, either by judgment or through fear of judgment. God is everywhere, it is true,
and He that made all things is not contained or confined to dwell in any place; and He is to be
worshipped in spirit and in truth by His true worshippers,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4064_1674893">539</A></SUP> in order that, as He heareth in secret, He may
also in secret justify and reward. But in regard to the answers to prayer which are visible to men,
who can search out His reasons for appointing some places rather than others to be the scene of
miraculous interpositions? To many the holiness of the place in which the body of the blessed Felix
is buried is well known, and to this place I desired them to repair; because from it we may receive
more easily and more reliably a written account of whatever may be discovered in either of them by
divine interposition. For I myself knew how, at Milan, at the tomb of the saints, where demons are
brought in a most marvellous and awful manner to confess their deeds, a thief who had come thither
intending to deceive by perjuring himself, was compelled to own his theft, and to restore what he had
taken away; and is not Africa also full of the bodies of holy martyrs? Yet we do not know of such
things being done in any place here. Even as the gift of healing and the gift of discerning of
spirits are not given to all saints,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4065_1675983">540</A></SUP> as
the apostle declares; so it is not at all the tombs of the saints that it has pleased Him who
divideth to each severally as He will, to cause such miracles to be wrought.</P>

<P>4. Wherefore, although I had purposed not to let this most heavy burden on my heart come to your
knowledge, lest I should disquiet you by a painful but useless vexation, it has pleased God to make
it known to you, perhaps for this reason, that you may along with me devote yourselves to prayer,
beseeching Him to condescend to reveal that which He knoweth, but which we cannot know in this
matter. For I did not presume to suppress or erase from the roll of his colleagues the name of this
presbyter, lest I should seem to insult the Divine Majesty, upon whose arbitration the case now
depends, if I were to forestall His decision by any premature decision of mine: for even in secular
affairs, when a perplexing case is referred to a higher authority, the inferior judges do not presume
to make any change while the reference is pending. Moreover, it was decreed in a Council of
bishops<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4067_1677074">541</A></SUP> that no clergyman who has not yet
been proved guilty be suspended from communion, unless he fail to present himself for the examination
of the charges against him. Boniface, however, humbly agreed to forego his claim to a letter of
commendation, by the use of which on his journey he might have secured the recognition of his rank,
preferring that both should stand on a footing of equality in a place where both were alike unknown.
And now if you, prefer that his name should not be read that we "may cut off occasion," as the
apostle says, from those that desire occasion<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4068_1677704">542</A></SUP> to justify their unwillingness to come to the
Church, this omission of his name shall be not our deed, but theirs on whose account it may be done.
For what does it harm any man, that men through ignorance refuse to have his name read from that
tablet, so long as a guilty conscience does not blot his name out of the Book of Life?</P>

<P>5. Wherefore, my brethren who fear God,: remember what the Apostle Peter says: Your adversary, the
devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4070_1678225">543</A></SUP> When he cannot devour a man through seducing him
into iniquity, he attempts to injure his good name, that if it be possible, he may give way under the
reproaches of men and the calumnies of slandering tongues, and may thus fall into his jaws. If,
however, he be unable even to sully the good name of one who is innocent, he tries to persuade him to
cherish unkindly suspicions of his brother, and judge him harshly, and so become entangled, and be an
easy prey. And who is able to know or to tell all his snares and wiles? Nevertheless, in reference to
those three, which belong more especially to the case before us; in the first place, lest you should
be turned aside to wickedness through following bad examples, God gives you by the apostle these
warnings: "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness, and what communion, hath light with darkness?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4071_1679168">544</A></SUP> and in another place: "Be not deceived; evil
communications corrupt good manners: awake to righteousness,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4072_1679296">545</A></SUP> and sin not."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4073_1679359">546</A></SUP> Secondly, that ye may not give way under the
tongues of slanderers, He saith by the prophet, "Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness, the
people in whose heart is My law: fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their
revilings.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4074_1679635">547</A></SUP> For the moth shall eat them up
like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be for
ever."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4075_1679829">548</A></SUP> And thirdly, lest you should be
undone through groundless and malevolent suspicions concerning any servants of God, remember that
word of the apostle, "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to
light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then
shall every man have praise of God;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4076_1680212">549</A></SUP> and
this also, "The things which are revealed belong to you, but the secret things belong unto the Lord
your God."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4077_1680348">550</A></SUP> </P>

<P>6. It is indeed manifest that such things do not take place in the Church without great sorrow on
the part of saints and believers; but let Him be our Comforter who hath foretold all these events,
and has warned us not to become cold in love through abounding iniquity, to endure to the end that we
may be saved. For, as far as I am concerned, if there be in me a spark of the love of Christ, who
among you is weak, and I am not weak? who among you is offended, and I burn not?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4079_1680998">551</A></SUP> Do not therefore add to my distresses, by your
yielding either by groundless suspicions or by occasion of other men's sins. Do not, I beseech you,
lest I say of you, "They have added to the pain of my wounds."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4080_1681230">552</A></SUP> For it is much more easy to bear the reproach of
those who take open pleasure in these our pains, of whom it was foretold in regard to Christ Himself,
"They that sit in the gate speak against Me, and I was the song of the drunkards,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4081_1681507">553</A></SUP> for whom also we have been taught to pray, and
to seek their welfare. For why do they sit at the gate, and what do they watch for, if it be not for
this, that so soon as any bishop or clergyman or monk or nun has fallen, they may have ground for
believing, and boasting, and maintaining that all are the same as the one that has fallen, but that
all cannot be convicted and unmasked? Yet these very men do not straightway cast forth their wives,
or bring accusation against their mothers, if some married woman has been discovered to be an
adulteress But the moment that any crime is either falsely alleged or actually proved against any one
who makes a profession of piety, these men are incessant and unwearied in their efforts to make this
charge be believed against all religious men. Those men, therefore, who eagerly find what is sweet to
their malicious tongues in the things which grieve us, we may compare to those dogs (if, indeed, they
are to be understood as increasing his misery) which licked the sores of the beggar who lay before
the rich man's gate, and endured with patience every hardship and indignity until he should come to
rest in Abraham's bosom.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4082_1682699">554</A></SUP> </P>

<P>7. Do not add to my sorrows, O ye who have some hope toward God. Let not the wounds which these
lick be multiplied by you, for whom we are in jeopardy every hour, having fightings without and fears
within, and perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils by the heathen, and perils by false
brethren.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4084_1683033">555</A></SUP> I know that you are grieved,
but is your grief more poignant than mine? I know that you are disquieted, and I fear lest by the
tongues of slanderers some weak one for whom Christ died should perish. Let not my grief be increased
by you, for it is not through my fault that this grief was made yours. For I used the utmost
precautions to secure, if it were possible, both that the steps necessary for the prevention of this
evil should not be neglected, and that it should not be brought to your knowledge, since this could
only cause unavailing vexation to the strong, and dangerous disquietude to the weak, among you. But
may He who hath permitted you to be tempted by knowing this, give you strength to bear the trial, and
"teach you out of His law, and give you rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for
the wicked."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4085_1683905">556</A></SUP> </P>

<P>8. I hear that some of you are more cast down with sorrow by this event, than by the fall of the
two deacons who had joined us from the Donatist party, as if they had brought reproach upon the
discipline of Proculeianus;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4087_1684150">557</A></SUP> whereas this
checks your boasting about me, that under my discipline no such inconsistency among the clergy had
taken place. Let me frankly say to you, whoever you are that have done this, you have not done well.
Behold, God hath taught you, "He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4088_1684472">558</A></SUP> and ye ought to bring no reproach against
heretics but this, that they are not Catholics. Be not like these heretics, who, because they have
nothing to plead in defence of their schism, attempt nothing beyond heaping up charges against the
men from whom they are separated, and most falsely boast that in these we have an unenviable
pre-eminence, in order that since they can neither impugn nor darken the truth of the Divine
Scripture, from which the Church of Christ spread abroad everywhere receives its testimony, they may
bring into disfavour the men by whom it is preached, against whom they are capable of affirming
anything-whatever comes into their mind. "But ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have
heard Him, and have been taught by Him."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4089_1685256">559</A></SUP>
For He Himself has guarded His believing people from undue disquietude concerning wickedness, even in
stewards of the divine mysteries, as doing evil which was their own, but speaking good which was His.
"All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works:
for they say, and do not."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4090_1685613">560</A></SUP> Pray by all
means for me, lest perchance "when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4091_1685742">561</A></SUP> but when you glory, glory not in me, but in the
Lord. For however watchful the discipline of my house may be, I am but a man, and I live among men;
and I do not presume to pretend that my house is better than the ark of Noah, in which among eight
persons one was found a castaway;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4092_1686045">562</A></SUP> or
better than the house of Abraham, regarding which it was said, "Cast out the bondwoman and her
son;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4093_1686169">563</A></SUP> or better than the house of Isaac,
regarding whose twin sons it was said, "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4094_1686299">564</A></SUP> or better than the house of Jacob himself, in
which Reuben defiled his father's bed;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4095_1686402">565</A></SUP> or
better than the house of David, in which one son wrought folly with his sister,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4096_1686505">566</A></SUP> and another rebelled against a father of such
holy clemency; or better than the band of companions of Paul the apostle, who nevertheless would not
have said, as above quoted, "Without are fightings, and within are fears," if he had dwelt with none
but good men; nor would have said, in speaking of the holiness and fidelity of Timothy, "I have no
man like-minded who will naturally care for your state; for all seek their own, not the things which
are Jesus Christ's;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4097_1686998">567</A></SUP> or better than the
band of the disciples of the Lord Christ Himself, in which eleven good men bore with Judas, who was a
thief and a traitor; or, finally, better than heaven itself, from which the angels fell.</P>

<P>9. I frankly avow to your Charity, before the Lord our God, whom I have taken, since the time when
I began to serve Him, as a witness upon my soul, that as I have hardly found any men better than
those who have done well in monasteries, so I have not found any men worse than monks who have
fallen; whence I suppose that to them applies the word written in the Apocalypse, "He that is
righteous, let him be still more righteous; and he that is filthy, let him be still more
filthy."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn40.htm#P4099_1687715">568</A></SUP> Wherefore, if we be grieved by
some foul blemishes, we are comforted by a much larger proportion of examples of an opposite kind.
Let not, therefore, the dregs which offend your eyes cause you to hate the oil-presses whence the
Lord's storehouses are supplied to their profit with a more brightly illuminating oil.</P>

<P>May the mercy of our Lord keep you in His peace, safe from all the snares of the enemy, my dearly
beloved brethren. </P>

<P>A short and stern challenge to some Manichaean teacher who had succeeded Fortunatus (supposed to
be Felix).</P>

<P>Your attempts at evasion are to no purpose: your real character is patent even a long way off. My
brethren have reported to me their conversation with you. You say that you do not fear death; it is
well: but you ought to fear that death which you are bringing upon yourself by your blasphemous
assertions concerning God. As to your understanding that the visible death which all men know is a
separation between soul and body, this is a truth which demands no great grasp of intellect. But as
to the statement which you annex to this, that death is a separation between good and evil, do you
not see that, if the soul be good and the body be evil, he who joined them together,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4106_1688976">569</A></SUP> is not good? But you affirm that the good God
has joined them together; from which it follows that He is either evil, or swayed by fear of one who
is evil. Yet you boast of your having no fear of man, whenat the same time you conceive God to be
such! that, through fear of Darkness, He would join together good and evil. Be not uplifted, as your
writing shows you to be, by supposing that I magnify you, by my resolving to check the out-flowing of
your poison, lest its insidious and pestilential power should do harm: for the apostle does not
magnify those whom he calls "dogs," saying to the Philippians, "Beware of dogs; "<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4107_1689621">570</A></SUP> nor does he magnify those of whom he says that
their word doth eat as a canker.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4108_1689722">571</A></SUP>
Therefore, in the name of Christ, I demand of you to answer, if you are able, the question which
baffled ),our predecessor Fortunatus.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4109_1689879">572</A></SUP> For
he went from the scene of our discussion declaring that he would not return, unless, after conferring
with his party, he found something by which he could answer the arguments used by our brethren. And
if you are not prepared to do this, begone from this place, and do not pervert the right ways of the
Lord, ensnaring and infecting with your poison the minds of the weak, lest, by the Lord's right hand
helping me, you be put to confusion in a way which you did not expect.</P>

</UL><P>Having anxiously inquired of our holy brother Firmus regarding your state, I was glad to hear
that you are well. I expected him to bring, or, I should rather say, I insisted upon his giving me, a
letter from you; upon which he told me that he had set out from Africa without communicating to you
his intention. I therefore send to you my respectful salutations through this brother, who clings to
you with a singular warmth of affection; and at the same time, in regard to my last letter, I beg you
to forgive the modesty which made it impossible for me to refuse you, when you had so long required
me to write you in reply. That letter, moreover, was not an answer from me to you, but a confronting
of my arguments with yours. And if it was a fault in me to send a reply (I beseech you hear me
patiently),.the fault of him who insisted upon it was still greater. But let us be done with such
quarrelling; let there be sincere brotherliness between us.; and henceforth let us exchange letters,
not of controversy, but of mutual charity. The holy brethren who with me serve the Lord send you
cordial salutations. Salute from us the holy brethren who with you bear Christ's easy yoke;
especially I beseech you to convey my respectful salutation to the holy father Alypius, worthy of all

  <UL><P><I>To Jerome, My Lord Beloved and Honoured in the Bowels of Christ, My Holy Brother and
Fellow-Presbyter, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Long ago I sent to your Charity a long letter in reply to the one which you remember
sending to me by your holy son Asterius, who is now not only my brother, but also my colleague.
Whether that reply reached you or not I do not know, unless I am to infer this from the words in your
letter brought to me by our most sincere friend Firmus, that if the one who first assaulted you with
his sword has been driven back by your pen, you rely upon my good feeling and equity to lay blame on
the one who brought, not on the one who repelled, the accusation. From this one indication, though
very slight, I infer that you have read my letter. In that letter I expressed indeed my sorrow that
so great discord had arisen between you and Rufinus, over the strength of whose former friendship
brotherly love was wont to rejoice in all parts to which the fame of it had come; but I did not in
this intend to rebuke you, my brother, whom I dare not say that I have found blameable in that
matter. I only lamented the sad lot of men in this world, in whose friendships, depending as they do
on the continuance of mutual regard, there is no stability, however great that regard may sometimes
be. I would rather, however, have been informed by your letter whether you have granted me the pardon
which I begged, of which I now desire you to give me more explicit assurance; although the more
genial and cheerful tone of your letter seems to signify that I have obtained what I asked in mine,
if indeed it was despatched after mine had been read by you, which is, as I have said, not clearly
indicated.</P>

<P>2. You ask, or rather you give a command with the confiding boldness of charity, that we should
amuse ourselves<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4126_1694643">574</A></SUP> in the field of Scripture
without wounding each other. For my part, I am by all means disposed to exercise myself in earnest
much rather than in mere amusement on such themes. If, however, you have chosen this word because of
its suggesting easy exercise, let me frankly say that I desire something more from one who has, as
you have, great talents under the control of a benignant disposition, together with wisdom
enlightened by erudition, and whose application to study, hindered by no other distractions, is year
after year impelled by enthusiasm and guided by genius: the Holy Spirit not only giving you all these
advantages, but expressly charging you to come with help to those who are engaged in great and
difficult investigations; not as if, in studying Scripture, they were amusing themselves on a level
plain, but as men punting and toiling up a steep ascent. If, however, perchance, you selected the
expression "ludamus" [let us amuse ourselves] because of the genial kindliness which befits
discussion between loving friends, whether the matter debated be obvious and easy, or intricate and
difficult, I beseech you to teach me how I may succeed in securing this; so that when I am
dissatisfied with anything which, not through want of careful attention, but perhaps through my
slowness of apprehension, has not been demonstrated to me, if I should, in attempting to make good an
opposite opinion, express myself with a measure of unguarded frankness, I may not fall under the
suspicion of childish conceit and forwardness, as if I sought to bring my own name into renown by
assailing illustrious men;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4127_1696374">575</A></SUP> and that if,
when something harsh has been demanded by the exigencies of argument, I attempt to make it less hard
to bear by stating it in mild and courteous phrases, I may not be pronounced guilty of wielding a
"honeyed sword." The only way which I can see for avoiding both these faults, or the suspicion of
either of them, is to consent that when I am thus arguing with a friend more learned than myself, I
must approve of everything which he says, and may not, even for the sake of more accurate
information, hesitate before accepting his decisions.</P>

<P>3. On such terms we might amuse ourselves without fear of offending each other in the field of
Scripture, but I might well wonder if the amusement was not at my expense. For I confess to your
Charity that I have learned to yield this respect and honour only to the canonical books of
Scripture: of these alone do I most firmly believe that the authors were completely free from error.
And if in these writings I am perplexed by anything which appears to me opposed to truth, I do not
hesitate to suppose that either the Ms. is faulty, or the translator has not caught the meaning of
what was said, or I myself have failed to understand it. As to all other writings, in reading them,
however great the superiority of the authors to myself in sanctity and learning, I do not accept
their teaching as true on the mere ground of the opinion being held by them; but only because they
have succeeded in convincing my judgment of in truth either by means of these canonical writings
themselves, or by arguments addressed to my reason. I believe, my brother, that this is your own
opinion as well as mine. I do not need to say that I do not suppose you to wish your books to be read
like those of prophets or of apostles, concerning which it would be wrong to doubt that they are free
from error. Far be such arrogance from that humble piety and just estimate of yourself which I know
you to have, and without which assuredly you would not have said, "Would that I could receive your
embrace, and that by converse we might aid each other in learning!"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4129_1698505">576</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>4. Now if, knowing as I do your life and conversation, I do not believe in regard to you that you
have spoken anything with an intention of dissimulation and deceit, how much more reasonable is it
for me to believe, in regard to the Apostle Paul, that he did not think one thing and affirm another
when he wrote of Peter and Barnabas: "When I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the
truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, `If thou, being a Jew, livest after the
manner of the Gentiles, and not as to the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews?'"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4132_1699144">577</A></SUP> For whom can I confide in, as
assuredly not deceiving me by spoken or written statements, if the apostle deceived his own
"children," for whom he "travailed in birth again until Christ (who is the Truth) were formed in
them"?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4133_1699390">578</A></SUP> After having previously said to
them, "The things which I. write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4134_1699514">579</A></SUP> a could he in writing to these same persons
state what was not true, and deceive them by a fraud which was in some way sanctioned by expediency,
when he said that he had seen Peter and Barnabas not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the
gospel, and that he had withstood Peter to the face because of this, that he was compelling the
Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews?</P>

<P>5. But you will say it is better to believe that. the Apostle Paul wrote what was not true, than
to believe that the Apostle Peter did what was not right. On this principle, we must say (which far
be it from us to say), that it is better to believe that the gospel history is false, than to believe
that Christ was denied by Peter;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4136_1700255">580</A></SUP> and
better to charge the book of Kings [second book of Samuel] with false statements, than believe that
so great a prophet, and one so signally chosen by the Lord God as David was, committed adultery in
lusting after and taking away the wife of another. and committed such detestable homicide in
procuring the death of her husband.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4137_1700610">581</A></SUP>
Better far that I should read with certainty and persuasion of its truth the Holy Scripture, placed
on the highest (even the heavenly) pinnacle of authority, and should, without questioning the
trustworthiness of its statements, learn from it that men have been either.commended, or corrected,
or condemned, than that, through fear of believing that by men, who, though of most praiseworthy
excellence, were no more than men, actions deserving rebuke might sometimes be done, I should admit
suspicions affecting the trustworthiness of the whole "oracles of God."</P>

<P>6. The Manichaeans maintain that the greater part of the Divine Scripture, by which their wicked
error is in the most explicit terms confuted, is not worthy of credit, because they cannot pervert
its language so as to support their opinions; yet they lay the blame of the alleged mistake not upon
the apostles who originally wrote the words, but upon some unknown corrupters of the manuscripts.
Forasmuch, however, as they have never succeeded in proving this by more numerous and by earlier
manuscripts, or by appealing to the original language from which the Latin translations have been
drawn, they retire from the arena of debate, vanquished and confounded by truth which is well known
to all. Does not your holy prudence discern how great scope is given to their malice against the
truth, if we say not (as they do) that the apostolic writings have been tampered with by others, but
that the apostles themselves wrote what they knew to be untrue?</P>

<P>7. You say that it is incredible that Paul should have rebuked in Peter that which Paul himself
had done. I am not at present inquiring about what Paul did, but about what he wrote. This is most
pertinent to the matter which I have in hand,-namely, the confirmation of the universal and
unquestionable truth of the Divine Scriptures, which have been delivered to us for our edification in
the faith, not by unknown men, but by the apostles, and have on this account been received as the
authoritative canonical standard. For if Peter did on that occasion what he ought to have done, Paul
falsely affirmed that he saw him walking not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel. For
whoever does what he ought to do, walks uprightly. He therefore is guilty of falsehood. who, knowing
that another has done what he ought to have done, says that he has not done uprightly, If, then, Paul
wrote what was true, it is true that Peter was not then walking up-rightly, according to the truth of
the gospel. He was therefore doing what he ought not to have done; and if Paul had himself already
done something of the same kind, I would prefer to believe that, having been himself corrected, he
could not omit the correction of his brother apostle, than to believe that he put down any false
statement in his epistle; and if in any epistle of Paul this would be strange, how much more in the
one in the preface of which he says, "The things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie
not"!</P>

<P>&amp; For my part, I believe that Peter so acted on this occasion as to compel the Gentiles to
live as Jews: because I read that Paul wrote this, and I do not believe that he lied. And therefore
Peter was not acting uprightly. For it was contrary to the truth of the gospel, that those who
believed in Christ should think that without those ancient ceremonies they could not be saved. This
was the position maintained at Antioch by those of the circumcision who had believed; against whom
Paul protested constantly and vehemently. As to Paul's circumcising of Timothy,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4141_1704204">582</A></SUP> performing a vow at Cenchrea,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4142_1704254">583</A></SUP> and undertaking on the suggestion of James at
Jerusalem to share the performance of the appointed rites with some who had made a vow,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4143_1704411">584</A></SUP> it is manifest that Paul's design in these
things was not to give to others the impression that he thought that by these observances salvation
is given under the Christian dispensation, but to prevent men from believing that he condemned as no
better than heathen idolatrous worship, those rites which God had appointed in the former
dispensation as suitable to it, and as shadows of things to come. For this is what James said to him,
that the report had gone abroad concerning him that he taught men "to forsake Moses."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4144_1704954">585</A></SUP> This would be by all means wrong for those who
believe in Christ, to forsake him who prophesied of Christ, as if they detested and condemned the
teaching of him of whom Christ said, "Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me; for he wrote
of Me."</P>

<P>9. For mark, I beseech you, the words of James: "Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews
there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: and they are informed of thee, that
thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not
to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. What is it therefore? the multitude
must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say to
thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at
charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they
were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest
the law. As touching the Gentiles which have believed, we have written and concluded that they
observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from
blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4146_1706272">586</A></SUP> It is, in my opinion, very clear that the reason
why James gave this advice was, that the falsity of what they had heard concerning him might be known
to those Jews, who, though they had believed in Christ, were jealous for the honour of the law, and
would not have it thought that the institutions which had been given by Moses to their fathers were
condemned by the doctrine of Christ as if they were profane, and had not been originally given by
divine authority. For the men who had brought this reproach against Paul were not those who
understood the right spirit in which observance of these ceremonies should be practised under the
Christian dispensation by believing Jews,-namely, as a way of declaring the divine authority of these
rites, and their holy use in the prophetic dispensation, and not as a means of obtaining salvation,
which was to them already revealed in Christ and ministered by baptism. On the contrary, the men who
had spread abroad this report against the apostle were those who would have these rites observed, as
if without their observance there could be no salvation to those who believed the gospel. For these
false teachers had found him to be a most zealous preacher of free grace, and a most decided opponent
of their views, teaching as he did that men are not justified by these things, but by the grace of
Jesus Christ, which these ceremonies of the law were appointed to foreshadow. This party, therefore,
endeavouring to raise odium and persecution against him, charged him with being an enemy of the law
and of the divine institutions; and there was no more fitting way in which he could turn aside the
odium caused by this false accusation, than by himself celebrating those rites which he was supposed
to condemn as profane, and thus showing that, on the one hand, the Jews were not to be debarred from
them as if they were unlawful, and on the other hand, that the Gentiles were not to be compelled to
observe them as if they were necessary.</P>

<P>10. For if he did in truth condemn these things in the way in which he was reported to have done,
and undertook to perform these rites in order that he might, by dissembling, disguise his real
sentiments, James would not have said to him, "and all shall know," but, "all shall <I>think</I> that
those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4148_1708639">587</A></SUP> especially seeing that in Jerusalem itself the
apostles had already decreed that no one should compel the Gentiles to adopt Jewish ceremonies, but
had not decreed that no one should then prevent the Jews from living according to their customs,
although upon them also Christian doctrine imposed no such obligation. Wherefore, if it was after the
apostle's decree that Peter's dissimulation at Antioch took place, whereby he was compelling the
Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews, which he himself was not compelled to do, although he
was not forbidden to use Jewish rites in order to declare the honour of the oracles of God which were
committed to the Jews;-if this,I say, were the case, was it strange that Paul should exhort him to
declare freely that decree which he remembered to have framed in conjunction with the other apostles
at Jerusalem?</P>

<P>11. If, however, as I am more inclined to think, Peter did this before the meeting of that council
at Jerusalem, in that case also it is not strange that Paul wished him not to conceal timidly, but to
declare boldly, a rule of practice in regard to which he already knew that they were both of the same
mind; whether he was aware of this from having conferred with him as to the gospel which both
preached, or from having heard that, at the calling of the centurion Cornelius, Peter had been
divinely instructed in regard to this matter, or from having seen him eating with Gentile converts
before those whom he feared to offend had come to Antioch. For we do not deny that Peter was already
of the same opinion in regard to this question as Paul himself was. Paul, therefore, was not teaching
Peter what was the truth concerning that matter, but was reproving his dissimulation as a thing by
which the Gentiles were compelled to act as Jews did; for no other reason than this, that the
tendency of all such dissembling was to convey or confirm the impression that they taught the truth
who held that believers could not be saved without circumcision and other ceremonies, which were
shadows of things to come.</P>

<P>12. For this reason also he circumcised Timothy, lest to the Jews, and especially to his relations
by the mother's side, it should seem that the Gentiles who had believed in Christ abhorred
circumcision as they abhorred the worship of idols; whereas the former was appointed by God, and the
latter invented by Satan. Again, he did not circumcise Titus, lest he should give occasion to those
who said that believers could not be saved without circumcision, and who, in order to deceive the
Gentiles, openly declared that this was the view held by Paul. This is plainly enough intimated by
himself, when he says: "But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be
circumcised: and that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out
our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: to whom we gave
place by subjection, no, not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with
you."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4151_1711708">588</A></SUP> Here we see plainly what he
perceived them to be eagerly watching for, and why it was that he did not do in the case of Titus as
he had done in the case of Timothy, and as he might otherwise have done in the exercise of that
liberty, by which he had shown that these observances were neither to be demanded as necessary to
salvation, nor denounced as unlawful.</P>

<P>73. You say, however, that in this discussion we must beware of affirming, with the philosophers,
that some of the actions of men lie in a region between right and wrong, and are to be reckoned,
accordingly, neither among good actions nor among the opposite;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4153_1712348">589</A></SUP> and it is urged in your argument that the
observance of legal ceremonies cannot be a thing indifferent, but either good or bad; so that if I
affirm it to be good, I acknowledge that we also are bound to observe these ceremonies; but if I
affirm it to be bad, I am bound to believe that the apostles observed them not sincerely, but in a
way of dissimulation. I, for my part, would not be so much afraid of defending the apostles by the
authority of philosophers, since these teach some measure of truth in their dissertations, as of
pleading on their behalf the practice of advocates at the bar, in sometimes serving their clients'
interests at the expense of truth. If, as is stated in your exposition of the Epistle to the
Galatians, this practice of barristers may be in your opinion with propriety quoted as resembling and
justifying dissimulation on the part of Peter and Paul, why should I fear to allege to you the
authority of philosophers whose teaching we account worthless, not because everything which they say
is false, but because they are in most things mistaken, and wherein they are found affirming truth,
are notwithstanding strangers to the grace of Christ, who is the Truth?</P>

<P>14. But why may I not say regarding these institutions of the old economy, that they are neither
good nor bad: not good, since men are not by them justified, they having been only shadows predicting
the grace by which we are justified; and not bad, since they were divinely appointed as suitable both
to the time and to the people? Why may I not say this, when I am supported by that saying of the
prophet, that I God gave unto His people "statutes that were not good"?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4155_1714063">590</A></SUP> For we have in this perhaps the reason of his
not calling them "bad," but calling them "not good," <I>i.e.</I> not such that either by them men
could be made good, or that without them men could not possibly become good. I would esteem it a
favour to be informed by your Sincerity, whether any saint, coming from the East to Rome, would be
guilty of dissimulation if he fasted on the seventh day of each week, excepting the Saturday before
Easter. For if we say that it is wrong to fast on the seventh day, we shall condemn not only the
Church of Rome, but also many other churches, both neighbouring and more remote, in which the same
custom continues to be observed. if, on the other hand, we pronounce it wrong not to fast on the
seventh day, how great is our presumption in censuring so many churches in the East, and by far the
greater part of the Christian world! Or do you prefer to say of this practice, that it is a thing
indifferent in itself, but commendable in him who conforms with it, not as a dissembler, but from a
seemly desire for the fellowship and deference for the feelings of others? No precept, however,
concerning this practice is given to Christians in the canonical books. How much more, then, may I
shrink from pronouncing that to be bad which I cannot deny to be of divine institution!-this fact
being admitted by me in the exercise of the same faith by which I know that not through these
observances, but by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, I am justified.</P>

<P>15. I maintain, therefore, that circumcision, and other things of this kind, were, by means of
what is called the Old Testament, given to the Jews with divine authority, as signs of future things
which were to be fulfilled in Christ; and that now, when these things have been fulfilled, the laws
concerning these rights remained only to be read by Christians in order to their understanding the
prophecies which had been given before, but not to be of necessity practised by them, as if the
coming of that revelation of faith which they prefigured was still future. Although, however, these
rites were not to be imposed upon the Gentiles, the compliance with them, to which the Jews had been
accustomed, was not to be prohibited in such a way as to give the impression that it was worthy of
abhorrence and condemnation. Therefore slowly, and by degrees, all this observance of these types was
to vanish away through the power of the sound preaching of the truth of the grace of Christ, to which
alone believers would be taught to ascribe their justification and salvation, and not to those types
and shadows of things which till then had been future, but which were now newly come and present, as
at the time of the calling of those Jews whom the personal coming of our Lord and the apostolic times
had found accustomed to the observance of these ceremonial institutions. The toleration, for the
time, of their continuing to observe these was enough to declare their excellence as things which,
though they were to be given up, were not, like the worship of idols, worthy of abhorrence; but they
were not to be imposed upon others, lest they should be thought necessary, either as means or as
conditions of salvation. This was the opinion of those heretics who, while anxious to be both Jews
and Christians, could not be either the one or the other. Against this opinion you have most
benevolently condescended to warn me, although I never entertained it. This also was the opinion with
which, through fear, Peter fell into the fault of pretending to yield concurrence, though in reality
he did not agree with it; for which reason Paul wrote most truly of him, that he saw him not walking
up-rightly, according to the truth of the gospel, and most truly said of him that he was compelling
the Gentiles to live as did the Jews. Paul did not impose this burden on the Gentiles through his
sincerely complying, when it was needful, with these ceremonies, with the design of proving that they
were not to be utterly condemned (as idol-worship ought to be); for he nevertheless constantly
preached that not by these things, but by the grace revealed to faith, believers obtain salvation,
lest he should lead any one to take up these Jewish observances as necessary to salvation. Thus,
therefore, I believe that the Apostle Paul did all these things honestly, and without dissimulation;
and yet if any one now leave Judaism and become a Christian, I neither compel nor permit him to
imitate Paul's example, and go on with the sincere observance of Jewish rites, any more than you, who
think that Paul dissembled when he practised these rites, would compel or permit such an one to
follow the apostle in that dissimulation.</P>

<P>16. Shall I also sum up "the matter in debate, or rather your opinion concerning it "<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4158_1718881">591</A></SUP> (to quote your own expression)? It seems to me
to be this: that after the gospel of Christ has been published, the Jews who believe do rightly if
they offer sacrifices as Paul did, if they circumcise their children as Paul circumcised Timothy, and
if they observe the "seventh day of the week, as the Jews have always done, provided only that they
do all this as dissemblers and deceivers." If this is your doctrine, we are now precipitated, not
into the heresy of Ebion, or of those who are commonly called Nazarenes, or any other known heresy,
but into some new error, which is all the more pernicious because it originates not in .mistake, but
in deliberate and designed endeavour to deceive. If, in order to clear yourself from the charge of
entertaining such sentiments, you answer that the apostles were to be commended for dissimulation in
these instances, their purpose being to avoid giving offence to the many weak Jewish believers who
did not yet understand that these things were to be rejected, but that now, when the doctrine of
Christ's grace has been firmly established throughout so many nations, and when, by the reading of
the Law and the Prophets throughout all the churches of Christ, it is well known that these are not
read for our observance, but for our instruction, any man who should propose to feign compliance with
these rites would be regarded as a madman. What objection can there be to my affirming that the
Apostle Paul, and other sound and faithful Christians, were bound sincerely to declare the worth of
these old observances by occasionally honouring them, lest it should be thought that these
institutions, originally full of prophetic significance, and cherished sacredly by their most pious
forefathers, were to be abhorred by their posterity as profane inventions of the devil? For now, when
the faith had come, which, previously foreshadowed by these ceremonies, was revealed after the death
and resurrection of the Lord, they became, so far as their office was concerned, defunct. But just as
it is seemly that the bodies of the deceased be carried honourably to the grave by their kindred, so
was it fitting that these rites should be removed in a manner worthy of their origin and history, and
this not with pretence of respect, but as a religious duty, instead of being forsaken at once, or
cast forth to be torn in pieces by the reproaches of their enemies, as by the teeth of dogs. To carry
the illustration further, if now any Christian (though he may have been converted from Judaism) were
proposing to imitate the apostles in the observance of these ceremonies, like one who disturbs the
ashes of those who rest, he would be not piously performing his part in the obsequies, but impiously
violating. the sepulchre.</P>

<P>17. I acknowledge that in the statement contained in my letter, to the effect that the reason why
Paul undertook (although he was an apostle of Christ) to perform certain rites, was that he might
show that these ceremonies were not pernicious to those who desired to continue that which they had
received by the Law from their fathers, I have not explicitly enough qualified the statement, by
adding that this was the case <I>only in that time in which the grace of faith was at first
revealed</I>; for at that time this was not pernicious. These observances were to be given up by all
Christians step by step, as time advanced; not all at once, lest, if this were done, men should not
perceive the difference between what God by Moses appointed to His ancient people, and the rites
which the unclean spirit taught men to practise in the temples of heathen deities. I grant,
therefore, that in this your censure is justifiable, and my omission deserved rebuke. Nevertheless,
long before the time of: my receiving your letter, when I wrote a treatise against Faustus the
Manichaean, I did not omit to insert the qualifying douse which I have just stated, in a short
exposition which I gave of the same passage, as you may see for yourself if you kindly condescend to
read that treatise; or you may be satisfied in any other way that you please by the bearer of this
letter, that I had long ago published this restriction of the general affirmation. And I now, as
speaking in the sight of God, beseech you by the law of charity to believe me when I say with my
whole heart, that it never was my opinion that in our time, Jews who become Christians were either
required or at liberty to observe in any manner, or from any motive whatever, the ceremonies of the
ancient dispensation; although I have always held, in regard to the Apostle Paul, the opinion which
you call in question, from the time that I became acquainted with his writings. Nor can these two
things appear incompatible to you; for you do not think it is the duty of any one in our day to feign
compliance with these Jewish observances, although you believe that the apostles did this.</P>

<P>18. Accordingly, as you in opposing me affirm, and, to quote your own words, "though the world
were to protest against it, boldly declare that the Jewish ceremonies are to Christians both hurtful
and fatal, and that whoever observes them, whether he was originally Jew or Gentile, is on his way to
the pit of perdition,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4161_1724149">592</A></SUP> I entirely indorse
that statement, and add to it, "Whoever observes these ceremonies, whether he was originally Jew or
Gentile, is on his way to the pit of perdition, not only if he is sincerely observing them, but also
if he is observing them with dissimulation." What more do you ask? But as you draw a distinction
between the dissimulation which you hold to have been practised by the apostles, and the rule of
conduct befitting the present time, I do the same between the course which Paul, as I think,
sincerely followed in all these examples then, and the matter of observing in our day these Jewish
ceremonies, although it were done, as by him, without any dissimulation, since it was then to be
approved, but is now to be abhorred. Thus, although we read that "the law and the prophets were until
John,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4162_1725008">593</A></SUP> and that "therefore the Jews
sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was
His Father, making Himself equal with God,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4163_1725202">594</A></SUP> and that "we have received grace for grace for
the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4164_1725339">595</A></SUP> and although it was promised by Jeremiah that
God would make a new covenant with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which He made
with their fathers;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4165_1725527">596</A></SUP> nevertheless I do not
think that the Circumcision of our Lord by His parents was an act of dissimulation. If any one object
that He did not forbid this because He was but an infant, I go on to say that I do not think that it
was with intention to deceive that He said to the leper, "Offer for thy cleansing those things which
Moses commanded for a testimony unto them,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4166_1725920">597</A></SUP> -thereby adding His own precept to the authority
of the law of Moses regarding that ceremonial usage. Nor was there dissimulation in His going up to
the feast,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4167_1726099">598</A></SUP> as there was also no desire to
be seen of men; for He went up, not openly, but secretly.</P>

<P>19. But the words of the apostle himself may be quoted against me: "Behold, I Paul say unto you,
that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4169_1726366">599</A></SUP> It follows from this that he deceived Timothy,
and made Christ profit him nothing, for he circumcised Timothy, Do you answer that this circumcision
did Timothy no harm, because it was done with an intention to deceive? I reply that the apostle has
not made any such exception. He does not say, If ye be circumcised without dissimulation, any more
than, If ye be circumcised with dissimulation. He says unreservedly, "If ye be circumcised, Christ
shall profit you nothing." As, therefore, you insist upon finding room for your interpretation, by
proposing to supply the words, "unless it be done as an act of dissimulation," I make no unreasonable
demand in asking you to permit me to understand the words, "if ye be circumcised," to be in that
passage addressed to those who demanded circumcision, for this reason, that they thought it
impossible for them to be otherwise saved by Christ. Whoever was then circumcised because of such
persuasion and desire, and with this design, Christ assuredly profited him nothing, as the apostle
elsewhere expressly affirms, "If righteousness come by the law, Christ is dead in vain.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4170_1727504">600</A></SUP> The same is affirmed in words which you have
quoted: "Christ is become of no effect to you, whosoever of you is justified by the law; ye are
fallen from grace."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4171_1727685">601</A></SUP> His rebuke,
therefore, was addressed to those who believed that they were to be justified by the law,-not to
those who, knowing well the design with which the legal ceremonies were instituted as foreshadowing
truth, and the time for which they were destined to be in force, observed them in order to honour Him
who appointed them at first. Wherefore also he says elsewhere, "If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are
not under the law,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4172_1728133">602</A></SUP> -a passage from which
you infer, that evidently "he has not the Holy Spirit who submits to the Law, not, as our fathers
affirmed the apostles to have done, feignedly under the promptings of a wise discretion, but "-as I
suppose to have been the case-"sincerely."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4173_1728415">603</A></SUP> </P>

<P>20. It seems to me important to ascertain precisely what is that submission to the law which the
apostle here condemns; for I do not think that he speaks here of circumcision merely, or of the
sacrifices then offered by our fathers, but now not offered by Christians, and other observances of
the same nature. I rather hold that he includes also that precept of the law, "Thou shalt not
covet,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4175_1728855">604</A></SUP> which we confess that Christians
are unquestionably bound to obey, and which we find most fully proclaimed by the light which the
Gospel has shed upon it.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4176_1729045">605</A></SUP> "The law," he
says, "is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good;" and then adds, "Was, then, that which
is good made death unto me? God forbid." "But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by
that which is good; that sin, by the commandment, might become exceeding sinful."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4177_1729393">606</A></SUP> As he says here, "that sin by the commandment
might become exceeding sinful," so elsewhere, "The law entered that the offence might abound; but
where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4178_1729607">607</A></SUP> Again, in another place, after affirming, when
speaking of the dispensation of grace, that grace alone justifies, he asks, "Wherefore then serveth
the law?" and answers immediately, "It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should
come to whom the promises were made."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4179_1729909">608</A></SUP> The
persons, therefore, whose submission to the law the apostle here pronounces to be the cause of their
own condemnation, are those whom the law brings in guilty, as not fulfilling its requirements, and
who, not understanding the efficacy of free grace, rely with self-satisfied presumption on their own
strength to enable them to keep the law of God; for "love is the fulfilling of the law."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4180_1730324">609</A></SUP> Now "the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts," not by our own power, but "by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4181_1730469">610</A></SUP> The satisfactory discussion of this, however,
would require too long a digression, if not a separate volume. If, then, that precept of the law,
"Thou shalt not covet," holds under it as guilty the man whose human weakness is not assisted by the
grace of God, and instead of acquitting the sinner, condemns him as a transgressor, how much more was
it impossible for those ordinances which were merely typical, circumcision and the rest, which were
destined to be abolished when the revelation of grace became more widely known, to be the means of
justifying any man! Nevertheless they were not on this ground to be immediately shunned with
abhorrence, like the diabolical impieties of heathenism, from the first beginning of the revelation
of the grace which had been by these shadows prefigured; but to be for a little while tolerated,
especially among those who joined the Christian Church from that nation to whom these ordinances had
been given. When, however, they had been, as it were, honourably buried, they were thenceforward to
be finally abandoned by all Christians.</P>

<P>21. Now, as to the words which you use, "non dispensative, ut nostri voluere majores,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4183_1731651">611</A></SUP> -"not in a way justifiable by expediency, the
ground on which our fathers were disposed to explain the conduct of the apostles,"-pray what do these
words mean? Surely nothing else than that which I call "officiosum mendacium," the liberty granted by
expediency being equivalent to a call of duty to utter a falsehood with pious intention. I at least
can see no other explanation, unless, of course, the mere addition of the words "permitted by
expediency" be enough to make a lie cease to be a lie; and if this be absurd, why do you not openly
say that a lie spoken in the way of duty<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4184_1732273">612</A></SUP>
is to be defended? Perhaps the name offends you, because the word "officium" is .not common in
ecclesiastical books; but this did not deter our Ambrose from its use, for he has chosen the title
"De Officiis" for some of his books that are full of useful rules. Do you mean to say, that whoever
utters a lie from a sense of duty is to be blamed, and whoever does the same on the ground of
expediency is to be approved? I beseech you, consider that the man who thinks this may lie whenever
he thinks fit, because this involves the whole important question whether to say what is false be at
any time the duty of a good man, especially of a Christian man, to whom it has been said, "Let your
yea be yea, and your nay, nay, lest ye fall into condemnation,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4185_1733055">613</A></SUP> and who believes the Psalmist's word, "Thou wilt
destroy all them that speak lies."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4186_1733171">614</A></SUP> </P>

<P>22. This, however, is, as I have said, another and a weighty question; I leave him who is of this
opinion to judge for himself the circumstances in which he is at liberty to utter a lie: provided,
however, that it be most assuredly believed and maintained that this way of lying is far removed from
the authors who were employed to write holy writings, especially the canonical Scriptures; lest those
who are the stewards of Christ, of whom it is said, "It is required in stewards, that a man be found
faithful,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4188_1733701">615</A></SUP> should seem to have proved
their fidelity by learning as an important lesson to speak what is false when this is expedient for
the truth's sake, although the word fidelity itself, in the Latin tongue, is said to Signify
originally a real correspondence between what is said and what is done.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4189_1734014">616</A></SUP> Now, where that which is spoken is actually
done, there is assuredly no room for falsehood. Paul therefore, as a "faithful steward" doubtless is
to be regarded as approving his fidelity in his writings; for he was a steward of truth, not of
falsehood. Therefore he wrote the truth when he wrote that he had seen Peter walking not uprightly,
according to the truth of the gospel, and that he had withstood him to the face because he was
compelling the Gentiles to live as the Jews did. And Peter himself received, with the holy and loving
humility which became him, the rebuke which Paul, in the interests of truth, and with the boldness of
love, administered. Therein Peter left to those that came after him an example, that, if at any time
they deviated from the right path, they should not think it beneath them to accept correction from
those who were their juniors,-an example more rare, and requiring greater piety, than that which
Paul's conduct on the same occasion left us, that those who are younger should have courage even to
withstand their seniors if the defence of evangelical truth required it, yet in such a way as to
preserve unbroken brotherly love. For while it is better for one to succeed in perfectly keeping the
right path, it is a thing much more worthy of admiration and praise to receive admonition meekly,
than to admonish a transgressor boldly. On that occasion, therefore, Paul was to be praised for
upright courage, Peter was to be praised for holy humility; and so far as my judgment enables me to
form an opinion, this ought rather to have been asserted in answer to the calumnies of Porphyry, than
further occasion given to him for finding fault, by putting it in his power to bring against
Christians this much more damaging accusation, that either in writing their letters or in complying
with the ordinances of God they practised deceit.</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>23. You call upon me to bring forward the name of even one whose opinion I have followed in this
matter, and at the same time you have quoted the names of many who have held before you the opinion
which you defend.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4192_1736199">617</A></SUP> You also say that if I
censure you for an error in this, you beg to be allowed to remain in error in company with such great
men. I have not read their writings; but although they are only six or seven in all, you have
yourself impugned the authority of four of them. For as to the Laodicean author,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4193_1736544">618</A></SUP> whose name you do not give, you say that he has
lately forsaken the Church; Alexander you describe as a heretic of old standing; and as to Origen and
Didymus, I read in some of your more recent works, censure passed on their opinions, and that in no
measured terms, nor in regard to insignificant questions, although formerly you gave Origen
marvellous praise. I suppose, therefore, that .you would not even yourself be contented to be in
error with these men; although the language which I refer to is equivalent to an assertion that in
this matter they have not erred. For who is there that would consent to be knowingly mistaken, with
whatever company he might share his errors? Three of the even therefore alone remain, Eusebius of
Emesa, Theodorus of Heraclea, and John, whom you afterwards mention, who formerly presided as pontiff
over the Church of Constantinople.</P>

<P>24. However, if you inquire or recall to memory the opinion of our Ambrose,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4195_1737522">619</A></SUP> and also of our Cyprian,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4196_1737586">620</A></SUP> on the point in question, you will perhaps find
that I also have not been without some whose footsteps I follow in that which I have maintained. At
the same time, as I have said already, it is to the canonical Scriptures alone that I am bound to
yield such implicit subjection as to follow their teaching, without admitting the slightest suspicion
that in them any mistake or any statement intended to mislead could find a place. Wherefore, when I
look round for a third name that I may oppose three on my side to your three, I might indeed easily
find one, I believe, if my reading had been extensive; but one occurs to me whose name is as good as
all these others, nay, of greater authority-I mean the Apostle Paul himself. To him I betake myself;
to himself I appeal from the verdict of all those commentators on his writings who advance an opinion
different from mine. I interrogate him, and demand from himself to know whether he wrote what was
true, or under some plea of expediency wrote what he knew to be false, when he wrote that he saw
Peter not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, and withstood him to his face.
because by that dissimulation he was compelling the Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews.
And I hear him in reply proclaiming with a solemn oath in an earlier part of the epistle, where he
began this narration, "The things that I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn41.htm#P4197_1739103">621</A></SUP> </P>

<P>25. Let those who think otherwise, however great their names, excuse my differing from them. The
testimony of so great an apostle using, in his own writings. an oath as a confirmation of their
truth, is of more weight with me than the opinion of any man, however learned, who is discussing the
writings of another. Nor am I afraid lest men should say that, in vindicating Paul from the charge of
pretending to conform to the errors of Jewish prejudice, I affirm him to have actually so conformed.
For as, on the one hand, he was not guilty of pretending conformity to error when, with the liberty
of an apostle, such as was suitable to that period of transition, he did, by practising those ancient
holy ordinances, when it was necessary to declare their original excellence as appointed not by the
wiles of Satan to deceive men, but by the wisdom of God for the purpose of typically foretelling
things to come; so, on the other hand, he was not guilty of real conformity to the errors of Judaism,
seeing that he not only knew, but also preached constantly and vehemently, that those were in error
who thought that these ceremonies were to be imposed upon the Gentile converts, or were necessary to
the justification of any who believed.</P>

<P>26. Moreover, as to my saying that to the Jews he became as a Jew, and to the Gentiles as a
Gentile, not with the subtlety of intentional deceit, but with the compassion of pitying love,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4200_1740544">622</A></SUP> it seems to me that you have not sufficiently
considered my meaning in the words; or rather, perhaps, I have not succeeded in making it plain. For
I did not mean by this that I supposed him to have practised in either case a feigned conformity; but
I said it because his conformity was sincere, not less in the things in which he became to the Jews
as a Jew, than in those in which he became to the Gentiles as a Gentile,-a parallel which you
yourself suggested, and by which I thankfully acknowledge that you have materially assisted my
argument. For when I had in my letter asked you to explain how it could be supposed that Paul's
becoming to the Jews as a Jew involved the supposition that he must have acted deceitfully in
conforming to the Jewish observances, seeing that no such deceptive conformity to heathen customs was
involved in his becoming as a Gentile to the Gentiles; your answer was, that his becoming to the
Gentiles as a Gentile meant no more than his receiving the uncircumcised, and permitting the free use
of those meats which were pronounced unclean by Jewish law. If, then, when I ask whether in this also
he practised dissimulation, such an idea is repudiated as palpably most absurd and false: it is an
obvious inference, that in his performing those things in which he became as a Jew to the Jews, he
was using a wise liberty, not yielding to a degrading compulsion, nor doing what would be still more
unworthy of him, viz. stooping from integrity to fraud out of a regard to expediency.</P>

<P>27. For to believers, and to those who know the truth, as the apostle testifies (unless here too,
perhaps, he is deceiving his readers), "every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if
it be received with thanksgiving."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4202_1742374">623</A></SUP>
Therefore to Paul himself, not only as a man, but as a steward eminently faithful, not only as
knowing, but also as a teacher of the truth, every creature of God which is used for food was not
feignedly but truly good. If, then, to the Gentiles he became as a Gentile, by holding and teaching
the truth concerning meats and circumcision although he feigned no conformity to the rites and
ceremonies of the Gentiles, why say that it was impossible for him to become as a Jew to the Jews,
unless he practised dissimulation in performing the rites of their religionWhy did he maintain the
true faithfulness of a steward towards the wild olive branch that was engrafted,and yet hold up a
strange veil of dissimulation, on the plea of expediency, before those who were the natural and
original branches of the olive tree? Why was it that, in becoming as a Gentile to the Gentiles, his
teaching and his conduct<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4203_1743300">624</A></SUP> are in harmony
with his real sentiments; but that, in becoming as a Jew to the Jews, he shuts up one thing in his
heart, and declares something wholly different in his words, deeds, and writings? But far be it from
us to entertain such thoughts of him. To both Jews and Gentiles he owed "charity out of a pure heart,
and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned; "<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4204_1743746">625</A></SUP> and therefore he became all things to all men,
that he might gain all,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4205_1743837">626</A></SUP> not with the
subtlety of a deceiver, but with the love of one filled with compassion; that is to say, not by
pretending himself to do all the evil things which other men did, but by using the utmost pains to
minister with all compassion the remedies required by the evils under which other men laboured, as if
their case had been his own.</P>

<P>28. When, therefore, he did not refuse to practise some of these Old Testament observances, he was
not led by his compassion for Jews to feign this conformity, but unquestionably was acting sincerely;
and by this course of action declaring his respect for those things which in the former dispensation
had been for a time enjoined by God, he distinguished between them and the impious rites of
heathenism. At that time, moreover, not with the subtlety of a deceiver, but with the love of one
moved by compassion, he became to the Jews as a Jew, when, seeing them to be in error, which either
made them unwilling to believe in Christ, or made them think that by these old sacrifices and
ceremonial observances they could be cleansed from sin and made partakers of salvation, he desired so
to deliver them from that error as if he saw not them, but himself, entangled in it; thus truly
loving his neighbour as himself, and doing to others as he would have others do to him if he required
their help,-a duty to the statement of which our Lord added these words, "This is the law and the
prophets."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4207_1745295">627</A></SUP> </P>

<P>29. This compassionate affection Paul recommends in the same Epistle to the Galatians, saying: "If
a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4209_1745567">628</A></SUP> See whether he has not said, "Make thyself as he
is, that thou mayest gain him." Not, indeed, that one should commit or pretend to have committed the
same fault as the one who has been overtaken, but that in the fault of that other he should consider
what might happen to himself, and so compassionately render assistance to that other, as he would
wish that other to do to him if the case were his; that is, not with the subtlety of a deceiver, but
with the love of one filled with compassion. Thus, whatever the error or fault in which Jew or
Gentile or any man was found by Paul, to all men he became all things,-not by feigning what was not
true, but by feeling, because the case might have been his own, the compassion of one who put himself
in the other's place,-that he might gain all.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>30. I beseech you to look, if you please, for a little into your own heart,-I mean, into your own
heart as it stands affected towards myself,-and recall, or if you have it in writing beside you, read
again, your own words in that letter (only too brief) which you sent to me by Cyprian our brother,
now my colleague. Read with what sincere brotherly and loving earnestness you have added to a serious
complaint of what I had done to you these words: "In this friendship is wounded, and the laws of
brotherly union are set at nought. Let not the world see us quarrelling like children, and giving
material for angry contention between those who may become our respective supporters or
adversaries."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4212_1747086">629</A></SUP> These words I perceive to
be spoken by you from the heart, and from a heart kindly seeking to give me good advice. Then you
add, what would have been obvious to me even without your stating it: "I write what I have now
written, because I desire to cherish towards you pure and Christian love, and not to hide in my heart
anything which does not agree with the utterance of my lips." O pious man, beloved by me, as God who
seeth my soul is witness, with a true heart I believe y, our statement; and just as I do not question
the sincerity of the profession which you have thus made in a letter to me, so do I by all means
believe the Apostle Paul when he makes the very same profession in his letter, addressed not to any
one individual, but to Jews and Greeks, and all those Gentiles who were his children in the gospel,
for whose spiritual birth he travailed, and after them to so many thousands of believers in Christ,
for whose sake that letter has been preserved. I believe, I say, that he did not "hide in his heart
anything which did not agree with the utterance of his lips."</P>

<P>31. You have indeed yourself done towards me this very thing,-becoming to me as I am,-"not with
the subtlety of deception, but with the love of compassion," when you thought that it behoved you to
take as much pains to prevent me from being left in a mistake, in which you believed me to be, as you
would have wished another to take for your deliverance if the case had been your own. Wherefore,
gratefully acknowledging this evidence of your goodwill towards me, I also claim that you also be not
displeased with me, if, when anything in your treatises disquieted me, I acquainted you with my
distress, desiring the same course to be followed by all towards me as I have followed towards you,
that whatever they think worthy of censure in my writings, they would neither flatter me with
deceitful commendation nor blame me before others for that of which they are silent towards myself;
thereby, as it seems to me, more seriously "wounding friendship and setting at nought the laws of
brotherly union." For I would hesitate to give the name of Christian to those friendships in which
the common proverb, "Flattery makes friends, and truth makes enemies,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4214_1749354">630</A></SUP> is of more authority than the scriptural
proverb, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4215_1749522">631</A></SUP> </P>

<P>32. Wherefore let us rather do our utmost to set before our beloved friends, who most cordially
wish us well in our labours, such an example that they may know that it is possible for the most
intimate friends to differ so much in opinion, that the views of the one may be contradicted by the
other without any diminution of their mutual affection, and without hatred being kindled by that
truth which is due to genuine friendship, whether the contradiction be in itself in accordance with
truth, or at least, whatever its intrinsic value is, be spoken from a sincere heart by one who is
resolved not "to hide in his heart anything which does not agree with the utterance of his lips." Let
therefore our brethren, your friends, of whom you bear testimony that they are vessels of Christ,
believe me when I say that it was wholly against my will that my letter came into the hands of many
others before it reached your own, and that my heart is filled with no small sorrow for this mistake.
How it happened would take long to tell, and this is now, if I am not mistaken, unnecessary; since,
if my word is to be taken at all in regard to this, it suffices for me to say that it was not done by
me with the sinister intention which is supposed by some, and that it was not by my wish, or
arrangement, or consent, or design that this has taken place. If they do not believe this, which I
affirm in the sight of God, I can do no more to satisfy them. Far be it, however, from me.to believe
that they made this suggestion to your Holiness with the malicious desire to kindle enmity between
you and me, from which may God in His mercy defend us! Doubtless, without any intention of doing me
wrong, they readily suspected me, as a man, to be capable of failings common to human nature. For it
is right for me to believe this concerning them, if they be vessels of Christ appointed not to
dishonour, but to honour, and made meet by God for every good work in His great house.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4217_1751512">632</A></SUP> If, however, this my solemn protestation come to
their knowledge, and they still persist in the same opinion of my conduct, you will yourself see that
in this they will do wrong.</P>

<P>33. As to my having written that I had never sent to Rome a book against you, I wrote this
because, in the first place, I did not regard the name "book" as applicable to my letter, and
therefore was under the impression that you had heard of something else entirely different from it;
in the second place, I had not sent the letter in question to Rome, but to you; and in the third
place, I did not consider it to be against you, because I knew that I had been prompted by the
sincerity of friendship, which should give I liberty for the exchange of suggestions and corrections
between us. Leaving out of sight for a little while your friends of whom I have spoken, I implore
yourself, by the grace whereby we have been redeemed, not to suppose that I have been guilty of
artful flattery in anything which I have said in my letters concerning the good gifts which have been
by the Lord's goodness bestowed on you. If, however, I have in anything wronged you, forgive me. As
to that incident in the life of some forgotten bard, which, with perhaps more pedantry than good
taste, I quoted from classic literature, I beg you not to carry the application of it to yourself
further than my words warranted for I immediately added: "I do not say this in order that you may
recover the faculty of spiritual sight-far be it from me to say that you have lost it!-but that,
having eyes both clear and quick in discernment, you may turn them to this matter."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4219_1753163">633</A></SUP> I thought a reference to that incident suitable
exclusively in connection with the <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>palinw|di/a</FONT>, in which we ought all to
imitate Stesichorus if we have written anything which it becomes our duty to correct in a writing of
later date, and not at all in connection with the blindness of Stesichorus, which I neither ascribed
to your mind, nor feared as likely to be fall you. And again, I beseech you to correct boldly
whatever you see needful to censure in my writings. For although, so far as the titles of honour
which prevail in the Church are concerned, a bishop's rank is above that of a presbyter, nevertheless
in many things Augustin is in inferior to Jerome; albeit correction is not to be refused nor
despised, even when it comes from I one who in all respects may be an inferior.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>34. As to your translation, you have now convinced me of the benefits to be secured by your
proposal to translate the Scriptures from the original Hebrew, in order that you may bring to light
those things which have been either omitted or perverted by the Jews. But I beg you to be so good as
state by what Jews this has been done, whether by those who before the Lord's advent translated the
Old Testament-and if so, by what one or more of them-or by the Jews of later times, who may be
supposed to have mutilated or corrupted the Greek Mss., in order to prevent themselves from being
unable to answer the evidence given by these concerning the Christian faith. I cannot find any reason
which should have prompted the earlier Jewish translators to such unfaithfulness. I beg of you,
moreover, to send us your translation of the Septuagint, which I did not know that you had published.
I am also longing to read that book of yours which you named <I>De optimo genere interpretandi</I>,
and to know from it how to adjust the balance between the product of the translator's acquaintance
with the original language, and the conjectures of those who are able commentators on the Scripture,
who, notwithstanding their common loyalty to the one true faith, must often bring forward various
opinions on account of the obscurity of many passages;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4222_1755325">634</A></SUP> although this difference of interpretation by no
means involves departure from the unity of the faith; just as one commentator may himself give, in
harmony with the faith which he holds, two different interpretations of the same passage, because the
obscurity of the passage makes both equally admissible.</P>

<P>35. I desire, moreover, your translation of the Septuagint, in order that we may be delivered, so
far as is possible, from the consequences of the notable incompetency of those who, whether qualified
or not, have attempted a Latin translation; and in order that those who think that I look with
jealousy on your useful labours, may at length, if it be possible, perceive that my only reason for
objecting to the public reading of your translation from the Hebrew in our churches was, lest,
bringing forward anything which was, as it were, new and opposed to the authority of the Septuagint
version, we should trouble by serious cause of offence the flocks of Christ, whose ears and hearts
have become accustomed to listen to that version to which the seal of approbation was given by the
apostles themselves. Wherefore, as to that shrub in the book of Jonah,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4224_1756646">635</A></SUP> if in the Hebrew it is neither "gourd" nor
"ivy," but something else which stands erect, supported by its own stem without other props, I would
prefer to call it "gourd" in all our Latin versions; for I do not think that the Seventy would have
rendered it thus at random, had they not known that the plant was something like a gourd.</P>

<P>36. I think I have now given a sufficient answer (perhaps more than sufficient) to your three
letters; of which I received two by Cyprian, and one by Firmus. In replying, send whatever you think
likely to be of use in instructing me and others. And I shall take more care, as the Lord may help
me, that any letter which I may write to you shall reach yourself before it fills into the hand of
any other, by whom its contents may be published abroad; for I confess that I would not like any
letter of yours to me to meet with the fate of which you justly complain as having befallen my letter
to you. Let us, however, resolve to maintain between ourselves the liberty as well as the love of
friends; so that in the letters which we exchange, neither of us shall be restrained from frankly
stating to the other whatever seems to him open to correction, provided always that this be done in
the spirit which does not, as inconsistent with brotherly love, displease God. if, however, you do
not think that this can be done between us without endangering that brotherly love, let us not do it:
for the love which I should like to see maintained between us is assuredly the greater love which
would make this mutual freedom possible; but the smaller measure of it is better than none at
all.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4226_1758285">636</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Lord Alypius Most Blessed, My Brotherand Colleague, Beloved and Longed for With
Sincere Veneration, and to the Brethren that are with Him, Augustin and the Brethren with Him Send
Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. The sorrow of the members of the Church at Thiave prevents my heart from having any rest
until I hear that they have been brought again to be of the same mind towards you as they formerly
were; which must be accomplished without delay. For if the apostle was concerned about one
individual, "lest perhaps such an one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow," adding in the
same context the words, "lest Satan should get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his
devices,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4232_1759684">637</A></SUP> how much more does it become us
to act with caution, lest we cause similar grief to a whole flock, and especially one composed of
persons who have lately been reconciled to the Catholic Church, and whom I can upon no account
forsake! As, however, the short time at our disposal did not permit us so to take counsel together as
to arrive at a mature and satisfactory decision, may it please your Holiness to accept in this letter
the finding which commended itself most to me when I had long reflected upon the matter since we
parted; and if you approve of it, let the enclosed letter,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4233_1760294">638</A></SUP> which I have written to them in the name of both
of us, be sent to them without delay.</P>

<P>2. You proposed that they should have the one half [of the property left by Honoratus], and that
the other half should be made up to them/by me from such resources as might be at my disposal. I
think, however, that if the whole property had been taken from them, men might reasonably have said
that we had taken the great pains in this matter which we have done, for the sake of justice, not for
pecuniary advantage. But when we concede to them one half, and in that way settle with them by a
compromise, it will be manifest that our anxiety has been only about the money; and you see what harm
must follow from this. For, on the one hand, we shall be regarded by them as having taken away one
half of a property to which we had no claim; and, on the other hand, they will be regarded by us as
dishonourably and unjustly consenting to accept aid from one half of a property of which the whole
belonged to the poor. For your remark, "We must beware lest, in our efforts to obtain a right
adjustment of a difficult question, we cause more serious wounds," applies with no less force if the
half be conceded to them. For those whose turning from the world to monastic life we desire to
secure, will, for the sake of this half of their private estates, be disposed to find some excuse for
putting off the sale of these, in order that their case may be dealt with according to this
precedent. Moreover, would it not be strange, if, in a question like this, where much may be said on
both sides, a whole community should, through our not avoiding the appearance of evil, be offended by
the impression that their bishops, whom they hold in high esteem, are smitten with sordid
avarice?</P>

<P>3. For when any one is turned to adopt the life of a monk, if he is adopting it with a true heart,
he does not think of that which I have just mentioned, especially if he be admonished of the
sinfulness of such conduct. But if he be a deceiver, and is seeking "his own things, not the things
which are Jesus Christ's,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4236_1762420">639</A></SUP> he has not
charity; and without this, what does it profit him, "though he bestow all his goods to feed the poor,
and though he give his body to be burned"?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4237_1762597">640</A></SUP> Moreover, as we agreed when conversing together,
this may be henceforth avoided, and an arrangement made with each individual who is disposed to enter
a monastery, if he cannot be admitted to the society of the brethren before he has relieved himself
of all these encumbrances, and comes as one at leisure from all business, because the property which
belonged to him has ceased to be his. But there is no other way in which this spiritual death of weak
brethren, and grievous obstacle to the salvation of those for whose reconciliation with the Catholic
Church we so earnestly labour, can be avoided, than by our giving them most clearly to understand
that we are by no means anxious about money in such cases as this. And this they cannot be made to
understand, unless we leave to their use the estate which they always supposed to belong to their
late presbyter; because, even if it was not his, they ought to have known this from the
beginning.</P>

<P>4. It seems to me, therefore, that in matters of this kind, the rule which ought to hold is, that
whatever belonged, according to the ordinary civil laws regarding property, to him who is an ordained
clergyman in any place, belongs after his death to the Church over which he was ordained. Now, by
civil law, the property in question belonged to the presbyter Honoratus; so that not only on account
of his being ordained elsewhere. but even had he remained in the monastery of Thagaste, if he had
died without having either sold his estate or handed it over by express deed of gift to any one, the
right of succession to it would belong only to his heirs: as brother Aemilianus inherited those
thirty shillings<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4239_1764279">641</A></SUP> left by the brother
Privatus. This, therefore, behoved to be considered and provided for in time; but if no provision was
made for it, we must, in the disposal of the estate, comply with the laws which have been appointed
to regulate in civil society the holding or not holding of property; that we may, so far as is in our
power, abstain not only from the reality, but also from all appearance of evil, and preserve that
good name which is so necessary to our office as stewards. How truly this procedure has the
appearance of evil, I beseech your wisdom to observe. For having heard of their sorrow, which we
ourselves witnessed at Thiave, fearing lest, as frequently happens, I should myself be mistaken
through partiality for my own opinion, I stated the facts of the case to our brother and colleague
Samsucius, without telling him at the time my present view of the matter, but rather stating the view
taken up by both of us when we were resisting their demands. He was exceedingly shocked, and wondered
that we had entertained such a view; being moved by nothing else but the ugly appearance of the
transaction, as one wholly unworthy not only of us, but of any man.</P>

<P>5. Wherefore I implore you to subscribe and transmit without delay the letter which I have written
to them in name of both of us. And even if, perchance, you discern the other course to be a just one
in the matter, let not these brethren who are weak be compelled to learn now what I myself cannot
understand; rather let this word of the Lord be remembered in dealing with them: "I have yet many
things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4241_1765918">642</A></SUP> For He Himself, out of condescension to such
weakness, said on another occasion (it was in reference to the payment of tribute), "Then are the
children free; notwithstanding lest we offend them," etc.; and sent Peter to pay the didrachmae which
were then exacted.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4242_1766203">643</A></SUP> For He knew another
law according to which he was not bound to make any such payment; but He made the payment which was
imposed upon Him by that law according to which, as I have said, succession to the estate of
Honoratus behoved to be regulated, if he died before either giving away or selling his property. Nay,
even in regard to the law of the Church, Paul showed forbearance towards the weak, and did not insist
upon his receiving the money due to him, although fully persuaded in his conscience that he might
with perfect justice insist upon it; waiving his claim, however, only because he thereby avoided a
suspicion of his motives which would mar the sweet savour of Christ among them, and abstained from
the appearance of evil in a region in which he knew that this was his duty, and probably even before
he had known by experience the sorrow which it would occasion. Let us now, though we are somewhat
behind-hand, and have been admonished by experience, correct that which we ought to have
foreseen.</P>

<P>6. I remember that you proposed when we parted that the brethren at Thagaste should hold me
responsible to make up the half of the sum claimed; let me say in conclusion, that as I fear
everything which may make my attempt unsuccessful, if you clearly perceive that proposal to be a just
one, I do not refuse to comply with it on this condition, however, that I am to pay the amount only
when I have it in my power, <I>i.e.</I> when something so considerable falls to our monastery at
Hippo that this can be done without unduly straitening us,-the amount remaining after the subtraction
of so large a sum being still such as to provide for our monastery here aft equal share in proportion
to the number of resident brethren.</P>

Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I myself feel how hard-hearted I must appear to you, and I can scarcely excuse to myself
my conduct in not consenting to send to your Holiness my son the deacon Lucillus, your own brother.
But when your own time comes to surrender to the claims of Churches in remote places some of those
whom you have educated, and who are most dear and sweet to you, then, and not till then, will you
know the pangs of longing which pierce me through and through for some who, once united to me in the
strongest and most pleasing intimacy, are no more beside me. Let me submit to your thoughts the case
of one who is far away. However strong be the bond of kindred between brothers, it does not surpass
the bond by which my brother Severus and I are united to each other, and yet you know how rarely I
have the happiness of seeing him. And this has been caused neither by his wish nor by mine, but
because of our giving to the claims of our mother the Church precedency above the claims of this
present world, out of regard to that coming eternity in which we shall dwell together and part no
more. How much more reasonable, therefore, is it for you to submit for the sake of the Church's
welfare to the absence of that brother, with whom you have not shared the food which the Lord our
Shepherd provides for nearly so long a period as I did with my most amiable fellow-townsman Severus,
who now only with an effort and at long intervals converses with me by means of brief
letters,-letters, moreover, which are for the most part burdened with the cares and affairs of other
men, instead of bearing to me any reminiscence of those green pastures in which we were wont to lie
down under Christ's loving care!</P>

<P>5. You will perhaps reply, "What then? May not my brother be of service to the Church here also?
Is it for any other end than usefulness to the Church that I desire to have him with me?" Truly, if
his being beside you seemed to me to be as important for the gathering in or ruling of the Lord's
flock as his presence here is for these ends, every one might justly blame me for being not merely
hard-hearted, but unjust. But since he is conversant with the Punic<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4250_1770344">644</A></SUP> language, through want of which the preaching of
the gospel is greatly hindered in these parts, whereas the use of that language is general with you,
do you think that we would be doing our duty in consulting for the welfare of the Lord's flocks, if
we were to send this talent to a place where it is not specially needful, and remove it from this
region, where we thirst for it with such parched spirits? Forgive me, therefore, when I do, not only
against your will, but also against my own feeling, what the care of the burden imposed upon me
compels me to do. The Lord, to whom you have given your heart, will grant you such aid in your
labours that you shall be recompensed for this kindness; for we acknowledge that you have with a good
grace rather than of necessity conceded the deacon Lucillus to the burning thirst of the regions in
which our lot is cast. For you will do me no small favour if you do not burden me with any further
request upon this subject, lest I should have occasion to appear anything more than somewhat
hard-hearted to you, whom I revere for your holy benignity of disposition.</P>

Highest Welfare is Sought by All My Prayers, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. You would not call me so inexorable if you did not think me also a dissembler. For what
else do you believe concerning my spirit, if I am to judge by what you have written, than that I
cherish towards you dislike and antipathy which merit blame and detestation; as if in a matter about
which, there could be but one opinion I was not careful lest, while warning others, I myself should
deserve reproof,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4256_1772214">645</A></SUP> or were wishing to cast
the mote out of your eye while retaining and fostering the beam in my own?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4257_1772333">646</A></SUP> It is by no means as you suppose. Behold! I
repeat this, and call God to witness, that if you were only to desire for yourself what I desire on
your behalf, you would now be living in Christ free from all disquietude, and would make the whole
Church rejoice in glory brought by you to His name. Observe, I pray you, that I have addressed you
not only as my brother, but also as my colleague. For it cannot be that any bishop whatsoever of the
Catholic Church should cease to be my colleague, so long as he has not been condemned by any
ecclesiastical tribunal. As to my refusing to hold communion with you, the only reason for this is
that I cannot flatter you. For inasmuch as I have begotten you in Christ, I am under very special
obligation to render to you the salutary severity of love in faithful admonition and reproof. It is
true that I rejoice in the numbers who have been, by God's blessing on your work, gathered into the
Catholic Church; but this does not make me less bound to weep that a greater number are being by you
scattered from the Church. For you have so wounded the Church of Hippo,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4258_1773460">647</A></SUP> that unless the Lord make you disengage yourself
from all secular cares and burdens, and recall you to the manner of living and deportment which
become the true bishop, the wound may soon be beyond remedy.</P>

<P>2. Seeing, however, that you continue to involve yourself more and more deeply in these affairs,
and have, notwithstanding your vow of renunciation, entangled yourself again with the things which
you had solemnly laid aside,-a step which could not be justified even by the laws of ordinary human
affairs; seeing also that you are reported to be living in a style of extravagance which cannot be
maintained by the slender income of your church,-why do you insist upon communion with me, while you
refuse to hear my rebuke of your faults? Is it that men whose complaints I cannot bear, may justly
blame me for whatever you do? You are, moreover, mistaken in suspecting that those who find fault
with you are persons who have always been against you even in your earlier life. It is not so: and
you have no reason to be surprised that many things escape your observation. But even were this the
case, it is your duty to secure that they find nothing in your conduct which they might reasonably
blame, and for which they might bring reproach against the Church. Perhaps you think that my reason
for saying these things is, that I have not accepted what you urged in your defence. Nay, rather my
reason is, that if I were to say nothing regarding these things, I would be guilty of that for which
I could urge nothing in my defence before God. I know your abilities; but even a man of dull mind is
kept from disquietude if he sets his affections on heavenly things, whereas a man of acute mind has
this gift in vain if he set his affections on earthly things. The office of a bishop is not designed
to enable one to spend a life of vanity. The Lord God, who has closed against you all the ways by
which you were disposed to make Him minister to your gain, in order that He may guide you, if you but
understand Him, into that way, with a view to the pursuit of which that holy responsibility was laid
upon you, will Himself teach you what I now say.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Noble Lord Caecilianus, My Son Truly and Justly Honourable and Esteemed in the Love
of Christ, Augustin, Bishop, Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>The renown of your administration and the fame of your virtues, as well as the praiseworthy
zeal and faithful sincerity of your Christian piety,-gifts of God which make you rejoice in Him from
whom they came, and from whom you hope to receive yet greater things,-have moved me to acquaint your
Excellency by this letter with the cares which agitate my mind. As our joy is great that throughout
the rest of Africa you have taken measures with remarkable success on behalf of Catholic unity, our
sorrow is proportionately great because the district of Hippo<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4265_1776356">648</A></SUP> and the neighbouring regions on the borders of
Numidia have not enjoyed the benefit of the vigour with which as a magistrate you have enforced your
proclamation, my noble lord, and my son truly and justly honourable and esteemed in the love of
Christ. Lest this should be regarded rather as due to the neglect of duty by me who bear the burden
of the episcopal office at Hippo, I have considered myself bound to mention it to your Excellency. If
you condescend to acquaint yourself with the extremities to which the effrontery of the heretics has
proceeded in the region of Hippo, as you may do by questioning my brethren and colleagues, who are
able to furnish your Excellency with information, or the presbyter whom I have sent with this letter,
I am sure you will so deal with this tumour of impious presumption, that it shall be healed by
warning rather than painfully removed afterwards by punishment.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter LXXXVII.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 405.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To His Brother Emeritus, Beloved and Longed For, Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I know that it is not on the possession of good talents and a liberal education that the
salvation of the soul depends; but when I hear of any one who is thus endowed holding a different
view from that which truth imperatively insists upon on a point which admits of very easy
examination, the more I wonder at such a man, the more I burn with desire to make his acquaintance,
and to converse with him; or if that be impossible, I long to bring his mind and mine into contact by
exchanging letters, which wing their flight even between places far apart. As I have heard that you
are such a man as I have spoken of, I grieve that you should be severed and shut out from the
Catholic Church, which is spread abroad throughout the whole world, as was foretold by the Holy
Spirit. What your reason for this separation is I do not know. For it is not disputed that the party
of Donatus is wholly unknown to a great part of the Roman world, not to speak of the barbarian
nations (to whom also the apostle said that he was a debtor<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4271_1778428">649</A></SUP> ) whose communion in the Christian faith is
joined with ours, and that in fact they do not even know at all when or upon what account the
dissension began. Now, unless you admit these Christians to be innocent of those crimes with which
you charge the Christians of Africa, you must confess that all of you are defiled by participation in
the wicked actions of all worthless characters, so long as they succeed (to put the matter mildly) in
escaping detection among you. For you do occasionally expel a member from your communion, in which
case his expulsion takes place only after he has committed the crime for which he merited expulsion.
Is there not some intervening time during which he escapes detection before he is discovered,
convicted, and condemned by you? I ask, therefore, whether he involved you in his defilement so long
as he was not discovered by you? You answer, "By no means." If, then, he were not to be discovered at
all, he would in that case never involve you in his defilement; for it sometimes happens that the
crimes committed by men come to light only after their death, yet this does not bring guilt upon
those Christians who communicated with them while they were alive. Why, then, have you severed
yourselves by so rash and profane schism from the communion of innumerable Eastern Churches, in which
all that you truly or falsely affirm to have been done in Africa has been and still is utterly
unknown? </P>

<P>2. For it is quite another question whether or not there be truth in the assertions made by you.
These assertions we disprove by documents much more worthy of credit than those which you bring
forward, and we further find in your own documents more abundant proof of those positions which you
assail. But this is, as I have said, another question altogether, to be taken up and discussed when
necessary. Meanwhile, let your mind give special attention to this: that no one can be involved in
the guilt of unknown crimes committed by persons unknown to him. Whence it is manifest that you have
been guilty of impious schism in separating yourselves from the communion of the whole world, to
which the things charged, whether truly or falsely, by you against some men in Africa, have been and
still are wholly unknown; although this also should not be forgotten, that even when known and
discovered, bad men do not harm the good who are in a Church, if either the power of restraining them
from communion be wanting, or the interests of the Church's peace forbid this to be done. For who
were those who, according to the prophet Ezekiel,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4273_1781018">650</A></SUP> obtained the reward of being marked before the
destruction of the wicked, and of escaping unhurt when they were destroyed, but those who sighed and
cried for the sins and iniquities of the people of God which were done in the midst of them? Now who
sighs and cries for that which is unknown to him? On the same principle, the Apostle Paul bears with
false brethren. For it is not of persons unknown to him that he says, "All seek their own, not the
things which are Jesus Christ's;" yet these persons he shows plainly to have been beside him. And to
what class do the men belong who have chosen rather to burn incense to idols or surrender the divine
books than to suffer death, if not to those who "seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ
"?</P>

<P>3. I omit many proofs which I might give from Scripture, that I may not make this letter longer
than is needful; and I leave many more things to be considered by yourself in the light of your own
learning. But I beseech you mark this, which is quite enough to decide the whole question: If so many
transgressors in the one nation, which was then the Church of God, did not make those who were
associated with them to be guilty like themselves; if that multitude of false brethren did not make
the Apostle Paul, who was a member of the same Church with them, a seeker not of the things of Jesus
Christ, but of his own,-it is manifest that a man is not made wicked by the wickedness of any one
with whom he goes to the altar of Christ, even though he be not unknown to him, provided only that he
do not encourage him in his wickedness, but by a good conscience disallowing his conduct keep himself
apart from him. It is therefore obvious that, to be art and part with a thief, one must either help
him in the theft, or receive with approbation what he has stolen. This I say in order to remove out
of the way endless and unnecessary questions concerning the conduct of men, which are wholly
irrelevant when advanced against our position.</P>

<P>4. If, however, you do not agree with what I have said, you involve the whole of your party in the
reproach of being such men as Optatus was, while, notwithstanding your knowledge of his crimes, he
was tolerated in communion with you; and far be it from me to say this of such a man as Emeritus, and
of others of like integrity among you, who are, I am sure, wholly averse to such deeds as disgraced
him. For we do not lay any charge against you but the one of schism, which by your obstinate
persistence in it you have now made heresy. How great this crime is in the judgment of God Himself,
you may see by reading what without doubt you have read ere now. You will find that Dathan and Abiram
were swallowed up by an opening of the earth beneath them,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4276_1783778">651</A></SUP> and that all the others who had conspired with
them were devoured by fire breaking forth in the midst of them. As a warning to men to shun this
crime, the Lord God signalized its commission with this immediate punishment, that He might show what
He reserves for the final recompense of persons guilty of a similar transgression, whom His great
forbearance spares for a time. We do not, indeed, find fault with the reasons by which you excuse
your tolerating Optatus among you. We do not blame you, because at the time when he was denounced for
his furious conduct in the mad abuse of power, when he was impeached by the groans of all
Africa,-groans in which you also shared, if you are what good report declares you to be,-a report
which, God knows, I most willingly believe,-you forbore from excommunicating him, lest he should
under such sentence draw away many with him, and rend your communion asunder with the frenzy of
schism. But this is the thing which is itself an indictment against you at the bar of God, O brother
Emeritus, that although you saw that the division of the party of Donators was so great an evil, that
it was thought better that Optatus should be tolerated in your communion than that division should be
introduced among you, you nevertheless perpetuate the evil which was wrought in the division of the
Church of Christ by your forefathers.</P>

<P>5. Here perhaps you will be disposed, under the exigencies of debate, to attempt to defend
Optatus. Do not so, I beseech you; do not so, my brother: it would not become you; and if it would
perchance be seemly for any one to do it (though, in fact, nothing is seemly which is wrong), it
assuredly would be unseemly for Emeritus to defend Optatus. Perhaps you reply that it would as little
become you to accuse him. Granted, by all means. Take, then, the course which lies between defending
and accusing him. Say, "Every man shall bear his own burden;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4278_1785722">652</A></SUP> "Who art thou that judgest another man's
servant?"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4279_1785792">653</A></SUP> If, then, notwithstanding the
testimony of all Africa,-nay more, of all regions to which the name of Gildo was carried, for Optatus
was not less notorious than he,-you have not dared. to pronounce judgment concerning Optatus, lest
you should rashly decide in regard to one unknown to you, is it, I ask, either possible or right for
us, proceeding solely on your testimony, to pronounce sentence rashly upon persons whom we do not
know? Is it not enough that you should charge them with things of which you have no certain
knowledge, without our pronouncing them guilty of things of which we know as little as yourselves?
For even though Optatus were in peril through the falsehood of detractors, you defend not him, but
yourself, when you say, "I do not know what his character was." How much more obvious, then, is it
that the Eastern world knows nothing of the character of those Africans with whom, though much less
known to you than Optatus, you find fault! Yet you are disjoined by scandalous schism from Churches
in the East, the names of which you have and you read in the sacred books. If your most famous and
most scandalously notorious Bishop of Thamugada<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4280_1786978">654</A></SUP> was at that very time not known to his
colleague, I shall not say in Caesarea, but in Sitifa, so close at hand, how was it possible for the
Churches of Corinth, Ephesus, Colosse, Philippi, Thessalonica, Antioch, Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
and others which were founded in Christ by the apostles, to know the case of these African traditors,
whoever they were; or how was it consistent with justice that they should be condemned by you for not
knowing it? Yet with these Churches you hold no communion. You say they are not Christian, and you
labour to rebaptize their members. What need I say? What complaint, what protest is necessary here?
If I am addressing a right-hearted man, I know that with you I share the keenness of the indignation
which I feel. For you doubtless see at once what I might say if I would.</P>

<P>6. Perhaps, however, your forefathers formed of themselves a council, and placed the whole
Christian world except themselves under sentence of excommunication. Have you come so to judge of
things, as to affirm that the council of the followers of Maximianus who were cut off from you, as
you were cut off from the Church, was of no authority against you, because their number was small
compared with yours; and yet claim for your council an authority against the nations, which are the
inheritance of Christ, and the ends of the earth, which are His possession?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4282_1788373">655</A></SUP> I wonder if the man who does not blush at such
pretensions has any blood in his body. Write me, I beseech you, in reply to this letter; for I have
heard from some, on whom I could not but rely, that you would write me an answer if I were to address
a letter to you. Some time ago, moreover, I sent you a letter; but I do not know whether you received
it or answered it, and perhaps your reply did not reach me. Now, however, I beg you not to re,fuse to
answer this letter, and state what you think. But do not occupy yourself with other questions than
the one which I have stated, for this is the leading point of a well-ordered discussion of the origin
of the schism.</P>

<P>7. The civil powers defend their conduct in persecuting schismatics by the rule which the apostle
laid down: "Whoso resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall
receive to themselves judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou
then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: for
he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him
that doeth evil."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4284_1789671">656</A></SUP> The whole question
therefore is, whether schism be not an evil work, or whether you have not caused schism, so that your
resistance of the powers that be is in a good cause and not in an evil work, whereby you would bring
judgment on yourselves. Wherefore with infinite wisdom the Lord not merely said, "Blessed are they
who are persecuted," but added, "for righteousness' sake."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4285_1790074">657</A></SUP> I desire therefore to know from you, in the
light of what I have said above, whether it be a work of righteousness to originate and perpetuate
your state of separation from the Church. I desire also to know whether it be not rather a work of
unrighteousness to condemn unheard the whole Christian world, either because it has not heard what
you have heard, or because no proof has been furnished to it of charges which Were rashly believed,
or without sufficient evidence advanced by you, and to propose on this ground to baptize a second
time: the members of so many churches rounded by the preaching and labours either of the Lord Himself
while He was on earth, or of His apostles; and all this on the assumption that it is excusable for
you either not to know the wickedness of your African colleagues who are living beside you, and are
using the same sacraments with you, or even to tolerate their misdeeds when known, lest the party of
Donatus should be divided, but that it is inexcusable for them, though they reside in most remote
regions, to be ignorant of what you either know, or believe, or have heard, or imagine, concerning
men in Africa. How great is the perversity of those who cling to their own unrighteousness, and yet
find fault with the severity of the civil powers!</P>

<P>8. You answer, perhaps, that Christians ought not to persecute even the wicked. Be it so; let us
admit that they ought not: but is it lawful to lay this objection in the way of the powers which are
ordained for this very purpose? Shall we erase the apostle's words? Or do your Mss. not contain the
words which I mentioned a little while ago? But you will say that we ought not to communicate with
such persons. What then? Did you withdraw, some time ago, from communion with the deputy Flavianus,
on the ground of his putting to death, in his administration of the laws, those whom he found guilty?
Again, you will say that the Roman emperors are incited against you by us. Nay, rather blame
yourselves for this, seeing that, as was long ago foretold in the promise concerning Christ, "Yea,
all kings shall fall down before him,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4287_1792212">658</A></SUP>
they are now members of the Church; and you have dared to wound the Church by schism, and still
presume to insist upon rebaptizing her members. Our brethren indeed demand help from the powers which
are ordained, not to persecute you, but to protect themselves against the lawless acts of violence
perpetrated by individuals of your party, which you yourselves, who refrain from such things, bewail
and deplore; just as, before the Roman Empire became Christian, the Apostle Paul took measures to
secure that the protection of armed Roman soldiers should be granted him against the Jews who bad
conspired to kill him. But these emperors, whatever the occasion of their becoming acquainted with
the crime of your schism might be, frame against you such decrees as their zeal and their office
demand. For they bear not the sword in vain; they are the ministers of God to execute wrath upon
those that do evil. Finally, if some of our party transgress the bounds of Christian moderation in
this matter, it displeases us; nevertheless, we do not on their account forsake the Catholic Church
because we are unable to separate the wheat from the chaff before the final winnowing, especially
since you yourselves have not forsaken the Donatist party on account of Optatus, when you had not
courage to excommunicate him for his crimes.</P>

<P>9. You say, however, "Why seek to have us joined to you, if we be thus stained with guilt?" I
reply: Because you still live, and may, if you are willing, be restored. For when you join yourselves
to us, <I>i.e.</I> to the Church of God, the heritage of Christ, who has the ends of the earth as his
possession, you are restored so that you live in vital union with the Root. For the apostle says of
the branches which were broken off: "God is able to graft them in again."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4289_1794025">659</A></SUP> We exhort you to change, in so far as concerns
your dissent from the Church; although, as to the sacraments which you had, we admit that they are
holy, since they are the same in all. Wherefore we desire to see you changed from your obstinacy,
that is, in order that you who have been cut off may be vitally united to the Root again. For the
sacraments which you have not changed are approved by us as you have them; else, in our attempting to
correct your sin, we should do impious wrong to those mysteries of Christ which have not been
deprived of their worth by your unworthiness. For even Saul did not, with all his sins, destroy the
efficacy of the anointing which he received; to which anointing David, that pious servant of God,
showed so great respect. We therefore do not insist upon rebaptizing you, because we only wish to
restore to you connection with the Root: the form of the branch which has been cut off we accept with
approval, if it has not been changed; but the branch, however perfect in its form, cannot bear fruit,
except it be united to the root. As to the persecution, so gentle and tempered with clemency, which
you say you suffer at the hands of our party, while unquestionably your own party inflict greater
harm in a lawless and irregular way upon us,-this is one question: the question concerning baptism is
wholly distinct from it; in regard to it, we inquire not where it is, but where it profits. For
wherever it is, it is the same; but it cannot be said of him who receives it, that wherever he is, he
is the same. We therefore detest the impiety of which men as individuals are guilty in a state of
schism; but we venerate everywhere the baptism of Christ. If deserters carry with them the imperial
standards, these standards are welcomed back again as they were, if they have remained unharmed, when
the deserters are either punished with a severe sentence, or, in the exercise of clemency, restored.
If, in regard to this, any more particular inquiry is to be made, that is, as I have said another
question; for in these things, the practice of the Church of God is the rule of our practice.</P>

<P>10. The question between us, however, is, whether your Church or ours is the Church of God. To
resolve this, we must begin with the original inquiry, why you became schismatics. If you do not
write me an answer, I believe that before the bar of God I shall be easily vindicated as having done
my duty in this matter; because I have sent a letter in the interests of peace to a man of whom I
have heard that, excepting only his adherence to schismatics, he is a good and well-educated man. Be
it yours to consider how you shall answer Him whose forbearance now demands your praise, and His
judgment shall in the end demand your fears. If, however, you write a reply to me with as much care
as you see me to have bestowed upon this, I believe that, by the mercy of God, the error which now
keeps us apart shall perish before the love of peace and the logic of truth. Observe that I have said
nothing about the followers of Rogatus,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4291_1797104">660</A></SUP>
who call you Firmiani, as you call us Macariani. Nor have I spoken of your bishop of Rucata (or
Rusicada), who is said to have made an agreement with Firmus, promising, on condition of the safety
of all his adherents, that the gates should be opened to him, and the Catholics given up to slaughter
and pillage. Many other such things I pass unnoticed. Do you therefore in like manner desist from the
commonplaces of rhetorical exaggeration concerning actions of men which you have either heard of or
known; for you see how I am silent concerning deeds of your party, in order to confine the debate to
the question upon which the whole matter hinges, namely, the origin of the schism.</P>

reconciliation.</P>

HREF="footnote/fn42.htm#P4298_1798363">662</A></SUP><I> Send the Following.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. Your clergy and your Circumcelliones are venting against us their rage in a persecution of
a new kind, and of unparalleled atrocity. Were we to render evil for evil, we should be transgressing
the law of Christ. But now, when all that has been done, both on your side and on ours, is
impartially considered, it is found that we are suffering what is written, "They rewarded me evil for
good;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4300_1798809">663</A></SUP> and (in another Psalm), "My soul
hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for
war."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4301_1798960">664</A></SUP> For, seeing that you have arrived
at so great age, we suppose you to know perfectly well that the party of Donatus, which at first was
called at Carthage the party of Majorinus, did of their own accord accuse Caecilianus, then bishop of
Carthage, before the famous Emperor Constantine. Lest, however, you should have forgotten this,
venerable sir, or should pretend not to know, or perhaps (which we scarcely think possible) may never
have known it, we insert here a copy of the narrative of Anulinus, then proconsul, to whom the party
of Majorinus appealed, requesting that by him as proconsul a statement of the charges which they
brought against Caecilianus should be sent to the Emperor aforesaid:-</P>

<P>2. <I>To Constantine Augustus, from Anulinus, a man of consular rank, proconsul of Africa,
these</I>:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4303_1799779">665</A></SUP> </P>

<P>The welcome and adored celestial writing sent by your Majesty to Caecilianus, and those over whom
he presides, who are called clergy, have been, by the care of your Majesty's most humble servant,
engrossed in his Records; and he has exhorted these parties that, heartily agreeing among themselves,
since they are seen to be exempted from all other burdens by your Majesty's clemency, they should,
preserving Catholic unity, devote themselves to their duties with the reverence due to the sanctity
of law and to divine things. After a few days, however, there arose some persons to whom a crowd of
people joined themselves, who thought that proceedings should. be taken against Caecilianus, and
presented to me<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4305_1800676">666</A></SUP> a sealed packet wrapped
in leather, and a small document without seal, and earnestly besought me to transmit them to your
Majesty's sacred and venerable court, which your Majesty's most humble servant<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4306_1800900">667</A></SUP> has taken care to do, Caecilianus continuing
meanwhile as he was. The Acts pertaining to the case are subjoined, in order that your Majesty may be
able to arrive at a decision concerning the whole matter. The documents sent are two: the one in a
leathern envelope, with this title, "A document of the Catholic Church containing charges against
Caecilianus, and furnished by the party of Majorinus;" the other attached without a seal to the same
leathern envelope.</P>

<P>Given on the 17th day before the Calends of May, in the third consulship of our lord Constantine
Augustus [<I>i.e.</I> April 15, a.d. 313].</P>

<P>3. After this report had been sent to him, the Emperor summoned the parties before a tribunal of
bishops to be constituted at Rome. The ecclesiastical records show how the case was there argued and
decided, and Caecilianus pronounced innocent. Surely now, after the peacemaking decision of the
tribunal of bishops, all the pertinacity of strife and bitterness should have given way. Your
forefathers, however, appealed again to the Emperor, and complained that the decision was not just,
and that their case had not been fully heard. Accordingly, he appointed a second tribunal of bishops
to meet in Aries, a town of Gaul, where, after sentence had been pronounced against your worthless
and diabolical schism, many of your party returned to a good understanding with Caecilianus; some,
however, who were most obstinate and contentious, appealed to the Emperor again. Afterwards, when,
yielding to their importunity, he personally interposed in this dispute, which belonged properly to
the bishops to decide, having heard the case, he gave sentence against your party, and was the first
to pass a law that the properties of your congregations should be confiscated; of all which things we
could insert the documentary evidence here, if it were not for making the letter too long. We must,
however, by no means omit the investigation and decision in open court of the case of Felix of
Aptunga, whom, in the Council of Carthage, under Secundus of Tigisis, primate, your fathers affirmed
to be the original cause of all these evils. For the Emperor aforesaid, in a letter of which we annex
a copy, bears witness that in this trial your party were before him as accusers and most strenuous
prosecutors:-</P>

<P>4. <I>The Emperors Flavius Constantinus, Maximus Caesar, and Valerius Licinius Caesar, to
Probianus, proconsul of Africa</I>:</P>

<P>Your predecessor Aelianus, who acted as substitute for Verus, the superintendent of the prefects,
when that most excellent magistrate was by severe illness laid aside in that part of Africa which is
under our sway, considered it, and most justly, to be his duty, amongst other things, to bring again
under his investigation and decision the matter of Caecilianus, or rather the odium which seems to
have been stirred up against that bishop of the Catholic Church. Wherefore, having ordered the
compearance of Superius, centurion, Caecilianus, magistrate of Aptunga, and Saturninus, the
ex-president of police, and his successor in the office, Calibius the younger, and Solon, an official
belonging to Aptunga, he heard the testimony of these witnesses;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4313_1804087">668</A></SUP> the result of which was, that whereas objection
had been taken to Caecilianus on the ground of his ordination to the office of bishop by Felix,
against whom it seemed that the charge of surrendering and burning the sacred books had been made,
the innocence of Felix in this matter was clearly established. Moreover, when Maximus affirmed that
Ingentius, a decurion of the town of Ziqua, had forged a letter of the ex-magistrate Caecilianus, we
found, on examining the Acts which were before us, that this. same Ingentius had been put on the
rack<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4314_1805137">669</A></SUP> for that offence, and that the
infliction of torture on him was not, as alleged, on the ground of his affirming that he was a
decurion of Ziqua. Wherefore we desire you to send under a suitable guard to the court of Augustus
Constantine the said Ingentius, that in the presence and hearing of those who are now pleading in
this case, and who day after day persist in their complaints, it may be made manifest and fully known
that they labour in vain to excite odium against the bishop Caecilianus, and to clamour violently
against him. This, we hope, will bring the people to desist, as they should do, from such
contentions, and to devote themselves with becoming reverence to their religious duties, undistracted
by dissension among themselves.</P>

<P>5. Since you see, therefore, that these things are so, why do you provoke odium against us on the
ground of the imperial decrees which are in force against you, when you have yourselves done all this
before we followed your example? If emperors ought not to use their authority in such cases, if care
of these matters lies beyond the province.of Christian emperors, who urged your forefathers to remit
the case of Caecilianus, By the proconsul, to the Emperor, and a second time to bring before the
Emperor accusations against a bishop whom you had somehow condemned in absence, and on his acquittal
to invent and bring before the same Emperor other calumnies against Felix, by whom the bishop
aforesaid had been ordained? And now, what other law is in force against your party than that
decision of the elder Constantine, to which your forefathers of their own choice appealed, which they
extorted from him by their importunate complaints, and which they preferred to the decision of an
episcopal tribunal? If you are dissatisfied with the decrees of emperors, who were the first to
compel the emperors to set these in array against you? For you have no more reason for crying out
against the Catholic Church because of the decrees of emperors against yon, than those men would have
had for crying out against Daniel, who, after his deliverance, were thrown in to be devoured by the
same lions by which they first sought to have him destroyed; as it is written: "The king's wrath is
as the roaring of a lion."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4316_1807413">670</A></SUP> These
slanderous enemies insisted that Daniel should be thrown into the den of lions: his innocence
prevailed over their malice; he was taken from the den unharmed and they, being cast into it,
perished. In like manner, your forefathers cast Caecilianus and his companions to be destroyed by the
king's wrath; and when, by their innocence, they were delivered from this, you yourselves now suffer
from these kings what your party wished them to suffer; as it is written: "Whoso diggeth a pit for
his neighbour, shall himself fall therein."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4317_1807975">671</A></SUP> </P>

<P>6. You have therefore no ground for complaint against us: nay more, the clemency of the Catholic
Church would have led us to desist from even enforcing these decrees of the emperors, had not your
clergy and Circumcelliones, disturbing our peace, and destroying us by their most monstrous crimes
and furious deeds of violence, compelled us to have these decrees revived and put in force again. For
before these more recent edicts of which you complain had come into Africa, these desperadoes laid
ambush for our bishops on their journeys, abused our clergy with savage blows, and assaulted our
laity in the same most cruel manner, and set fire to their habitations. A certain presbyter who had
of his own free choice preferred the unity of our Church, was for so doing dragged out of his own
house, cruelly beaten without form of law, rolled over and over in a miry pond, covered with a
matting of rushes, and exhibited as an object of pity to some and of ridicule to others, while his
persecutors gloried in their crime; after which they carried him away where they pleased, and:
reluctantly set him at liberty after twelve days., When Proculeianus<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4319_1809170">672</A></SUP> was challenged by our bishop concerning this
outrage, at a meeting of the municipal courts, be at first endeavoured to evade inquiry into the
matter by pretending that he knew nothing of it; and when the demand was immediately repeated, he
publicly declared that he would say nothing more on the subject. And the perpetrators of that outrage
are at this day among your presbyters, continuing moreover to keep us in terror, and to persecute us
to the utmost of their power.</P>

<P>7. Our bishop, however, did not complain to the emperors of the wrongs and persecution which the
Catholic Church in our district suffered in those days. But when a Council had been convened,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4321_1809894">673</A></SUP> it was agreed that you should be invited to meet
our party peaceably, in order that, if it were possible, you [<I>i.e.</I> the bishops on both sides,
for the letter is written by the clergy of Hippo] might have a conference, and the error being taken
out of the way, brotherly love might rejoice in the bond of peace between us. You may learn from your
own records the answer which Proculeianus made at first on that occasion, that you would call a
Council together, and would there see what you ought to answer; and how afterwards, when he was again
publicly reminded of his promise, he stated, as the Acts bear witness, that he refused to have any
conference with a view to peace. After this, when the notorious atrocities of your clergy and
Circumcelliones continued, a case was brought to trial;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4322_1810717">674</A></SUP> and Crispinus being condemned as a heretic,
although he was through the forbearance of the Catholics exempted from the fine which the imperial
edict imposed on heretics of ten pounds of gold, nevertheless thought himself warranted in appealing
to the emperors. As to the answer which was.made to that appeal, was it not extorted by the preceding
wickedness of your party and by his own appeal? And yet, even after that answer was given, he was
permitted to escape the infliction of that fine, through the intercession of our bishops with the
Emperor on his behalf. From that Council, however, our bishops sent deputies to the court, who
obtained a decree that not all your bishops and clergy should be held liable to this fine of ten
pounds of gold, which the decree had imposed on all heretics, but only those in whose districts the
Catholic Church suffered violence at the hands of your party. But by the time that the deputation
came to Rome, the wounds of the Catholic bishop of Bugle, who had just then been dreadfully injured,
had moved the Emperor to send such edicts as were actually sent. When these edicts came to Africa,
seeing especially that strong pressure had begun to be brought upon you, not to any evil thing, but
for your good, what should you have done but invited our bishops to meet you, as they had invited
yours to meet them, that by a conference the truth might be brought to light?</P>

<P>8. Not only, however, have you failed to do this. but your party go on inflicting yet greater
injuries upon us. Not contented with beating us with bludgeons and killing some with the sword, they
even, with incredible ingenuity in crime, throw lime mixed with acid [? vitriol] into our people's
eyes to blind them. For pillaging our houses, moreover, they have fashioned huge and formidable
implements, armed with which they wander here and there, breathing out threats of slaughter, rapine,
burning of houses and blinding of our eyes; by which things we have been constrained in the first
instance to complain to you, venerable sir, begging you to consider how, under these so-called
terrible laws of Catholic emperors, many, nay all of you, who say that you are the victims of
persecution, are settled in peace in the possessions which were your own, or which you have taken
from others, while we suffer such unheard-of wrongs at the hands of your party. You say that you are.
persecuted, while we are killed with clubs and! swords by your armed men. You say that you are
persecuted, while our houses are pillaged by your armed robbers. You say that you are persecuted,
while many of us have our eyesight destroyed by the lime and acid with which your men are armed for
the purpose. Moreover, if their course of crime brings some of them to death, they make out that
these deaths are justly the occasion of odium against us, and of glory to them. They take no blame to
themselves for the harm which they do to us, and they lay upon us the blame of the harm which they
bring upon themselves. They live as robbers, they die as Circumcelliones, they are honoured as
martyrs! Nay, I do injustice to robbers in this comparison; for we have never heard of robbers
destroying the eyesight of those whom they have plundered: they indeed take away those whom they kill
from the light, but they do not take away the light from those whom they leave in life.</P>

<P>9. On the other hand, if at any time we get men of your party into our power, we keep them
unharmed, showing great love towards them; and we tell them everything by which the error which has
severed brother from brother is refuted. We do as the Lord Himself commanded us, in the words of the
prophet Isaiah: "Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at His word; say, Ye are our brethren, to
those who hate you, and who cast you out, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and that He may
appear to them with joy; but let them be put to shame."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4325_1814846">675</A></SUP> And thus some of them we persuade, through their
considering the evidences of the truth and the beauty of peace, not to be baptized anew for this sign
of allegiance to our king they have already received (though they were as deserters), but to accept
that faith, and love of the Holy Spirit, and union to the body of Christ, which formerly they had
not. For it is written, "Purifying their hearts by faith;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4326_1815297">676</A></SUP> and again, "Charity covereth a multitude of
sins."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4327_1815367">677</A></SUP> If, however, either through too
great obduracy, or through shame making them unable to bear the taunts of those with whom they were
accustomed to join so frequently in falsely reproaching us and contriving evil against us, or perhaps
more through fear lest they should come to share along with us such injuries as they were formerly
wont to inflict on us,-if, I say, from any of these causes, they refuse to be reconciled to the unity
of Christ, they are allowed to depart, as they were detained, without suffering any harm. We also
exhort our laity as far as we can to detain them without doing them any harm, and bring them to us
for admonition and instruction. Some of them obey us and do this, if it is in their power: others
deal with them as they would with robbers, because they actually suffer from them such things as
robbers are wont to do. Some of them strike their assailants in protecting their own bodies from
their blows: while others apprehend them and bring them to the magistrates; and though we intercede
on their behalf, they do not let them off, because they are very much afraid of their savage
outrages. Yet all the while, these men, though persisting in the practices of robbers, claim to be
honoured as martyrs when they receive the due reward of their deeds!</P>

<P>10. Accordingly our desire, which we lay before you, venerable sir, by this letter and by the
brethren whom we have sent, is as follows. In the first place, if it be possible, let a peaceable
conference be held with our bishops, so that an end may be put to the error itself, not to the men
who embrace it, and men corrected rather than punished; and as you formerly despised their proposals
for agreement, let them now proceed from your side. How much better for you to have such a conference
between your bishops and ours, the proceedings of which may be written down and sent with signature
of the parties to.the Emperor, than to confer with the civil magistrates, who cannot do otherwise
than administer the laws which have been passed against you! For your colleagues who sailed from this
country said that they had come to have their case heard by the prefects. They also named our holy
father the Catholic bishop Valentinus, who was then at court, saying that they wished to be heard
along with him. This the judge could not concede, as he was guided in his judicial functions by the
laws which were passed against you: the bishop, moreover, had not come on this footing, or with any
such instructions from his colleagues. How much better qualified therefore will the Emperor himself
be to decide regarding your case, when the report of that conference has been read before him, seeing
that he is not bound by these laws, and has power to enact other laws instead of them; although it
may be said to be a case upon which final decision was pronounced long ago! Yet, in wishing this
conference with you, we seek not to have a second final decision, but to have it made known as
already settled to those who meanwhile are not aware that it is so. If your bishops be willing to do
this, what do you thereby lose? Do you not rather gain, inasmuch as your willingness for such
conference will become known, and the reproach, hitherto deserved, that you distrust your own cause
will be taken away? Do you, perchance, suppose that such conference would be unlawful? Surely you are
aware that Christ our Lord spoke even to the devil concerning the law,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4329_1818825">678</A></SUP> and that by the Apostle Paul debates were held
not only with Jews, but even with heathen philosophers of the sect of the Stoics and of the
Epicurean,.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4330_1818996">679</A></SUP> Is it, perchance, that the
laws of the Emperor do not permit you to meet our bishops? If so, assemble together in the meantime
your bishops in the region of Hippo, in which we are suffering such wrongs from men of your party.
For how much more legitimate and open is the way of access to us for the writings which you might
send to us, than for the arms with which they assail us!</P>

<P>11. Finally, we beg you to send back such writings by our brethren whom we have sent to you. If,
however, you will not do this, at least hear us as well as those of your own party, at whose hands we
suffer such wrongs Show us the truth for which you allege that you suffer persecution, at the time
when we are suffering so great cruelties from your side. For if you convict us of being in error,
perhaps you will concede to us an exemption from being rebaptized by you, because we were baptized by
persons whom you have not condemned; and you granted this exemption to those whom Felicianus of
Musti, and Praetextatus of Assuri, had baptized during the long period in which you! were attempting
to east them out of their churches by legal interdicts, because they were in communion with
Maximianus, along with whom they were condemned explicitly and by name in the Council of Bagae. All
which things we can prove by the judicial and municipal transactions, in which you brought forward
the decisions of this same Council of yours, when you wished to show the judges that the persons!
whom you were expelling from your ecclesiastical buildings were persons by schism separated from you.
Nevertheless, you who have by schism severed yourselves from the seed of Abraham, in whom all the
nations of the earth are blessed,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4332_1820716">680</A></SUP> refuse
to be expelled from our ecclesiastical buildings, when the decree to this effect proceeds not from
judges such as you employed in dealing with schismatics from your sect, but from the kings of the
earth themselves, who worship Christ as the prophecy had foretold, and from whose bar you retired
vanquished when you brought accusation against Caecilianus.</P>

<P>12. If, however, you will neither instruct us nor listen to us, come yourselves, or send into the
district of Hippo some of your party, with some of us as their guides, that they may see your army
equipped with their weapons; nay, more fully equipped than ever army was before, for no soldier when
fighting against barbarians was ever known to add to his other weapons lime and acid to destroy the
eyes of his enemies. [If you refuse this also, we beg you at least to write to them to desist now
from these things, and refrain from murdering, plundering, and blinding our people. We will not say,
condemn them; for it is for yourselves to see how no contamination is brought to you by the
toleration within your communion of those whom we prove to be robbers, while contamination is brought
to us by our having members against whom you have never been able to prove that they were traditors.
If, however, you treat all our remonstrances with contempt, we shall never regret that we desired to
act in a peaceful and orderly way. The Lord will so plead for His Church, that you, on the other
hand, shall regret that you despised our humble attempt at conciliation.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P4335_1822258"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Letter LXXXIX.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 406.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Festus, My Lord Well Beloved, My Son Honourable and Worthy of Esteem, Augustin Sends
Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. If, on behalf of error and inexcusable dissension, and falsehoods which have been in every
way possible disproved, men are so presumptuous as to persevere in boldly assailing and threatening
the Catholic Church, which seeks their salvation, how much more is it reasonable and right for those
who maintain the truth of Christian peace and unity,-truth which commends itself even to those who
profess to deny it or attempt to resist it,-to labour constantly and with energy, not only in the
defence of those who are already Catholics, but also for the correction of those who are not yet
within the Church! For if obstinacy aims at the possession and exercise of indomitable strength, how
great should be the strength of constancy which devotes persevering and unwearied labours to a cause
which it knows to be both pleasing to God, and beyond all question necessarily approved by the
judgment of wise men!</P>

<P>2. Could there, moreover, be anything more lamentable as an instance of perversity, than for men
not only to refuse to be humbled by the correction of their wickedness, but even to claim
commendation for their conduct, as is done by the Donatists, when they boast that they are the
victims of persecution; either through incredible blindness not knowing, or through inexcusable
passion pretending not to know, that men are made martyrs not by the amount of their suffering, but
by the cause in which they suffer? This I would say even were I opposing men who were only involved
in the darkness of error, and suffering penalties on that account most truly merited, and who had not
dared to assault any one with insane violence. But what shall I say against those whose fatal
obstinacy is such that it is checked only by fear of losses, and is taught only by exile how
universal (as had been foretold) is the diffusion of the Church, which they prefer to attack rather
then to acknowledge? And if the things which they suffer under this most gentle discipline be
compared with those things which they in reckless fury perpetrate, who does not see to which party
the name of persecutors more truly belongs? Nay, even though wicked sons abstain from violence, they
do, by their abandoned way of life, inflict upon their affectionate parents a much more serious wrong
than their father and mother inflict upon them, when, with a sternness proportioned to the strength
of their love, they endeavour without dissimulation to compel them to live uprightly.</P>

<P>3. There exist the strongest evidences in public documents, which you can read if you please, or
rather, which I beseech and exhort you to read, by which it is proved that their predecessors, who
originally separated themselves from the peace of the Church, did of their own accord dare to bring
accusation against Caecilianus before the Emperor by means of Anulinus, who was proconsul at that
time. Had they gained the day in that trial, what else would Caecilianus have suffered at the hands
of the Emperor than that which, when they were defeated, he awarded to them? But truly, if they
having accused him had prevailed, and Caecilianus and his colleagues had been expelled from their
sees, or, through persisting in their conspiracy, had exposed themselves to severer punishments (for
the imperial censure could not pass unpunished the resistance of persons who had been defeated in the
civil courts), they would then have published as worthy of all praise the Emperor's wise measures and
anxious care for the good of the Church. But now, because they have themselves lost their case, being
wholly unable to prove the charges which they advanced, if they suffer anything for their iniquity,
they call it persecution; and not only set no bounds to their wicked violence, but also claim to be
honoured as martyrs: as if the Catholic Christian emperors were following in their measures against
their most obstinate wickedness any other precedent than the decision of Constantine, to whom they of
their own accord appealed as the accusers of Caecilianus, and whose authority they so esteemed above
that of all the bishops beyond the sea, that to him rather than to them they referred this
ecclesiastical dispute. To him, again, they protested against the first judgment given against them
by the bishops whom he had appointed to examine the case in Rome, and to him also they appealed
against the second judgment given by the bishops at Arles: yet when at last they were defeated by his
own decision, the), remained unchanged in their perversity. I think that even the devil himself would
not have had the assurance to persist in such a cause, if he had been so often overthrown by the
authority of the judge to whom he had of his own will chosen to appeal.</P>

<P>4. It may be said, however, that these are human tribunals, and that they might have been cajoled,
misguided, or bribed. Why, then, is the Christian world libelled and branded with the crime laid to
the charge of some who are said to have surrendered to persecutors the sacred books? For surely it
was neither possible for the Christian world, nor incumbent upon it, to do otherwise than believe the
judges whom the plaintiffs had chosen, rather than the plaintiffs against whom these judges
pronounced judgments. These judges are responsible to God for their opinion, whether just or unjust;
but what has the Church, diffused throughout the world, done that it should be deemed necessary for
her to be rebaptized by the Donatists upon no other ground than because, in a case in which she was
not able to decide as to the truth, she has thought herself called upon to believe those who were in
a position to judge it rightly, rather than those who, though defeated in the civil courts, refused
to yield? O weighty indictment against all the nations to which God promised that they should be
blessed in the seed of Abraham, and has now made His promise good! When they with one voice demand,
Why do you wish to rebaptize us? the answer given is, Because you do not know what men in Africa were
guilty of surrendering the sacred books; and being thus ignorant, accepted the testimony of the
judges who decided the case as more worthy of credit than that of those by whom the accusation was
brought. No man deserves to be blamed for the crime of another; what, then, has the whole world to do
with the sin which some one in Africa may have committed? No man deserves to be blamed for a crime
about which he knows nothing; and how could the whole world possibly know the crime in this case,
whether the judges or the party condemned were guilty? Ye who have understanding, judge what I say.
Here is the justice of heretics: the party of Donatus condemns the whole world unheard, because the
whole world does not condemn a crime unknown. But for the world, truly, it suffices to have the
promises of God, and to see fulfilled in itself what prophets predicted so long ago, and to recognise
the Church by means of the same Scriptures by which Christ her King is recognised. For as in them are
foretold concerning Christ the things which we read in gospel history to have been fulfilled in Him,
so also in them have been foretold concerning the Church the things which we now behold fulfilled in
the world.</P>

<P>5. Possibly some thinking people might be disturbed by what they are accustomed to say regarding
baptism, viz. that it is the true baptism of Christ only when it is administered by a righteous man,
were it not that on this subject the Christian world holds what is most manifestly! evangelical truth
as taught in the words of John: "He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon
whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with
the Holy! Ghost."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4343_1830124">681</A></SUP> Wherefore the Church
calmly declines to place her hope in man, lest she fall under the curse pronounced in Scripture,
"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4344_1830303">682</A></SUP>
but places her hope in Christ, who so took upon Him the form of a servant as not to lose the form of
God, of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth." Therefore, whoever the man be, and
whatever office he bear who administers the ordinance, it is not he who baptizes,-that is the work of
Him upon whom the dove descended. So great is the absurdity in which the Donatists are involved in
consequence of these foolish opinions, that they can find no escape from it. For when they admit the
validity and reality of baptism when one of their sect baptizes who is a guilty man, but whose guilt
is concealed, we ask them, Who baptizes in this case? and they can only answer, God; for they cannot
affirm that a man guilty of sin (say of adultery) can sanctify any one. If, then, when baptism is
administered by a man known to be righteous, he sanctifies the person baptized; but when it is
administered by a wicked man, whose wickedness is hidden, it is not he, but God, who sanctifies.
Those who are baptized ought to wish to be baptized rather by men who are secretly bad than by men
manifestly good, for God sanctifies much more effectually than any righteous man can do. If it be
palpably absurd that one about to be baptized ought to wish to be baptized by a hypocritical
adulterer rather than by a man of known chastity, it follows plainly, that whoever be the minister
that dispenses the rite, the baptism is valid, because He Himself baptizes upon whom the dove
descended.</P>

<P>6. Notwithstanding the impression which truth so obvious should produce on the ears and hearts of
men, such is the whirlpool of evil custom by which some have been engulfed, that rather than yield,
they will resist both authority and argument of every kind. Their resistance is of two kinds-either
with active rage or with passive immobility. What remedies, then, must the Church apply when seeking
with a mother's anxiety the salvation of them all, and distracted by the frenzy of some and the
lethargy of others? Is it right, is it possible, for her to despise or give up any means which may
promote their recovery? She must necessarily be esteemed burdensome by both, just because she is the
enemy of neither. For men in frenzy do not like to be bound, and men in lethargy do not like to be
stirred up; nevertheless the diligence of charity perseveres in restraining the one and stimulating
the other, out of love to both. Both are provoked, but both are loved; both, while they continue
under their infirmity, resent the treatment as vexatious; both express their thankfulness for it when
they are cured.</P>

<P>7. Moreover, whereas they think and boast that we receive them into the Church just as they were,
it is not so. We receive them completely changed, because they do not begin to be Catholics until
they have ceased to be heretics. For their sacraments, which we have in common with them, are not the
objects of dislike to us, because they are not human, but Divine. That which must be taken from them
is the error, which is their own, and which they have wickedly imbibed; not the sacraments, which
they have received like ourselves, and which they bear and have,-to their own condemnation, indeed,
because they use them so unworthily; nevertheless, they truly have them. Wherefore, when their error
is forsaken, and the perversity of schism corrected in them, they pass over from heresy into the
peace of the Church, which they formerly did not possess, and without which all that they did possess
was only doing them harm. If, however, in thus passing over they are not sincere, this is a matter
not for us, but for God, to judge. And yet, some who were suspected of insincerity because they had
passed over to us through fear, have been found in some subsequent temptations so faithful as to
surpass others who had been originally Catholics. Therefore let it not be said that nothing is
accomplished when strong measures are employed. For when the entrenchments of stubborn custom are
stormed by fear of human authority, this is not all that is done, because at the same time faith is
strengthened, and the understanding convinced, by authority and arguments which are Divine.</P>

<P>8. These things being so, be it known to your Grace that your men in the region of Hippo are still
Donatists, and that your letter has had no influence upon them. The reason why it failed to move them
I need not write; but send some one, either a servant or a friend of your own, whose fidelity you can
entrust with the commission, and let him come not to them in the first place, but to us without their
knowledge; and when he has carefully consulted with us as to what is best to be done, let him do it
with the Lord's help. For in these measures we are acting not only for their welfare, but also on
behalf of our own men who have become Catholics, to whom the vicinity of these Donatists is so
dangerous, that it cannot be looked upon by us as a small matter.</P>

<P>I could have written much more briefly; but I wished you to have a letter from me, by which you
might not only be yourself informed of the reason of my solicitude, but also be provided with an
answer to any one who might dissuade you from earnestly devoting your energies to the correction of
the people who belong to you, and might speak against us for wishing you to do this. If in this I
have done what was unnecessary, because you had yourself either learned or thought out these
principles, or if I have been burdensome to you by inflicting so long a letter upon one so engrossed
with public affairs, I beg you to forgive me. I only entreat you not to despise what I have brought
before you and requested at your hands. May the mercy of God be your safeguard!</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Noble Lord and Brother, Worthy of All Esteem, Bishop Augustin, Nectarius Sends
Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>I do not dwell upon the strength of the love men bear to their native land, for you know it.
It is the only emotion which has a stronger claim than love of kindred. If there were any limit or
time beyond which it would be lawful for right-hearted men to withdraw themselves from its control, I
have by this time well earned exemption from the burdens which it imposes. But since love and
gratitude towards our country gain strength every day, and the nearer one comes to the end of life,
the more ardent is his desire to leave his country in a safe and prosperous condition, I rejoice, in
beginning this letter, that I am addressing myself to a man who is versed in all kinds of learning,
and therefore able to enter into my feelings.</P>

<P>There are many things in the colony of Calama which justly bind my love to it. I was born here,
and I have (in the opinion of others) rendered great services to this community. Now, my lord most
excellent and worthy of all esteem, this town has fallen disastrously by a grievous misdemeanour on
the part of her citizens,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4355_1837189">683</A></SUP> which must be
punished with very great severity, if we are dealt with according to the rigour of the civil law. But
a bishop is guided by another law. His duty is to promote the welfare of men, to interest himself in
any case only with a view to the benefit of the parties, and to obtain for other men the pardon of
their sins at the hand of the Almighty God. Wherefore I beseech you with all possible urgency to
secure that, if the matter is to be made the subject of a prosecution, the guiltless be protected,
and a distinction drawn between the innocent and those who did the wrong. This, which, as you see, is
a demand in accordance with your own natural sentiments, I pray you to grant. An assessment to
compensate for the losses caused by the tumult can be easily levied. We only deprecate the severity
of revenge. May you live in the more full enjoyment of the Divine favour, my noble lord, and brother
worthy of all esteem.</P>

</UL><P>(a.d. 408.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To My Noble Lord and Justly Honoured Brother Nectarius, Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I do not wonder that, though your limbs are chilled by age, your heart still glows with
patriotic fire. I admire this, and, instead of grieving, I rejoice to learn that you not only
remember, but by your life and practice illustrate, the maxim that there is no limit either in
measure or in time to the claims which their country has upon the care and service of right-hearted
men. Wherefore we long to have you enrolled in the service of a higher and nobler country, through
holy love, to which (up to the measure of our capacity) we are sustained amid the perils and toils
which we meet with among those whose welfare we seek in urging them to make that country their own.
Oh that we had you such a citizen of that country, that you would think that there ought to be no
limit either in measure or in time to your efforts for the good of that small portion of her citizens
who are on this earth pilgrims! This would be a better loyalty, because you would be responding to
the claims of a better country; and if you resolved that in your time on earth your labours for her
welfare should have no end, you would in her eternal peace be recompensed with joy that shall have no
end.</P>

<P>2. But till this be done,-and it is not beyond hope that you should be able to gain, or should
even now be most wisely considering that you. ought to gain, that country to which your father has
gone before you,-till this be done, I say, you: must excuse us if, for the sake of that country which
we desire never to leave, we cause some distress to that country which you desire to leave in the
full bloom of honour and prosperity. As to the flowers which thus bloom in your country, if we were
discussing this subject with one of your wisdom, we have no doubt that you would be easily convinced,
or rather, would yourself readily perceive, in what way a commonwealth should flourish. The foremost
of your poets has sung of certain flowers of Italy; but in your own country we have been taught by
experience, not how it has blossomed with heroes, so much as how it has gleamed with weapons of war:
nay, I ought to write how it has burned rather than how it has gleamed; and instead of the weapons of
war, I should write the fires of incendiaries. If so great a crime were to remain unpunished, I
without any rebuke such as the miscreants have deserved, do you think that you would leave your
country in the full bloom of honour and prosperity? O blooming flowers, yielding not fruit, but
thorns! Consider now whether you would prefer to see your country flourish by the piety of its
inhabitants, or by their escaping the punishment of their crimes; by the correction of their manners,
or by outrages to which impunity emboldens them. Compare these things, I say, and judge whether or
not you love your country more than we do; whether its prosperity and honour are more truly and
earnestly sought by you or by us.</P>

<P>3. Consider for a little those books, <I>De Republica</I>, from which you imbibed that sentiment
of a most loyal citizen, that there is no limit either in measure or in time to the claims which
their country has upon the care and service of right-hearted men. Consider them, I beseech you, and
observe how great are the praises there bestowed upon frugality, self-control, conjugal fidelity, and
those chaste, honourable, and upright manners, the prevalence of which in any city entitles it to be
spoken of as flourishing. Now the Churches which are multiplying throughout the world are, as it
were, sacred seminaries of public instruction, in which this sound morality is inculcated and
learned, and in which, above all, men are taught the worship due to the true and faithful God, who
not only commands men to attempt, but also gives grace to perform, all those things by which the soul
of man is furnished and fitted for fellowship with God, and for dwelling in the eternal heavenly
kingdom. For this reason He hath both foretold and commanded the casting down of the images of the
many false gods which are in the world. For nothing so effectually renders men depraved in practice,
and unfit to be good members of society, as the imitation of such deities as are described and
extolled in pagan writings.</P>

<P>4. In fact, those most learned men (whose <I>beau ideal</I> of a republic or commonwealth in this
world was, by the way, rather investigated or described by them in private discussions, than
established and realized by them in public measures) were accustomed to set forth as models for the
education of youth the examples of men whom they esteemed eminent and praiseworthy, rather than the
example given by their gods. And there is no question that the young man in Terence,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4364_1843018">684</A></SUP> who, beholding a picture upon the wall in which
was portrayed the licentious conduct of the king of the gods, fanned the flame of the passion which
mastered him, by the encouragement which such high authority gave to wickedness, would not have
fallen into the desire, nor have plunged into the commission, of such a shameful deed if he had
chosen to imitate Cato instead of Jupiter; but how could he make such a choice, when he was compelled
in the temples to worship Jupiter rather than Cato? Perhaps it may be said that we should not bring
forward from a comedy arguments to put to shame the wantonness and the impious superstition of
profane men. But read or recall to mind how wisely it is argued in the books above referred to, that
the style and the plots of comedies would never be approved by the public voice if they did not
harmonize with the manners of those who approved them; wherefore, by the authority of men most
illustrious and eminent in the commonwealth to which they belonged, and engaged in debating as to the
conditions of a perfect commonwealth, our position is established, that the most degraded of men may
be made yet worse if they imitate their gods,-gods, of course, which are not true, but false and
invented.</P>

<P>5. You will perhaps reply, that all those things which were written long ago concerning the life
and manners of the gods are to be far otherwise than literally understood and interpreted by the
wise. Nay, we have heard within the last few days that such wholesome interpretations are now read to
the people when assembled in the temples. Tell me, is the human race so blind to truth as not to
perceive things so plain and palpable as these? When, by the art of painters, founders, hammermen,
sculptors, authors, players, singers, and dancers, Jupiter is in so many places exhibited in flagrant
acts of lewdness, how important it was that in his own Capitol at least his worshippers might have
read a decree from himself prohibiting such crimes! If, through the absence of such prohibition,
these monsters, in which shame and profanity culminate, are regarded with enthusiasm by the people,
worshipped in their temples, and laughed at in their theatres; if, in order to provide sacrifices for
them, even the poor must be despoiled of their flocks; if, in order to provide actors who shall by
gesture and dance represent their infamous achievements, the rich squander their estates, can it be
said of the communities in which these things are done, that they flourish? The flowers with which
they bloom owe their birth not to a fertile soil, nor to a wealthy and bounteous virtue; for them a
worthy parent is found in that goddess Flora,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4366_1845726">685</A></SUP> whose dramatic games are celebrated with a
profligacy so utterly dissolute and shameless, that any one may infer from them what kind of demon
that must be which cannot be appeased unless-not birds, nor quadrupeds, nor even human life-but (oh,
greater villany!) human modesty and virtue, perish as sacrifices on her altars.</P>

<P>6. These things I have said, because of your having written that the nearer you come to the end of
life, the greater is your desire to leave your country in a safe and flourishing condition. Away with
all these vanities and follies, and let men be converted to the true worship of God, and to chaste
and pious manners: then will you see your country flourishing, not in the vain opinion of fools, but
in the sound judgment of the wise; when your fatherland here on earth shall have become a portion of
that Fatherland into which we are born not by the flesh, but by faith, and in which all the holy and
faithful servants of God shall bloom in the eternal summer, when their labours in the winter of time
are done. We are therefore resolved, neither on the one hand to lay aside Christian gentleness, nor
on the other to leave in your city that which would be a most pernicious example for all others to
follow. For success in this dealing we trust to the help of God, if His indignation against the
evil-doers be not so great as to make Him withhold His blessing. For certainly both the gentleness
which we desire to maintain, and the discipline which we shall endeavour without passion to
administer, may be hindered, if God in His hidden counsels order it otherwise, and either appoint
that this so great wickedness be punished with a more severe chastisement, or in yet greater
displeasure leave the sin without punishment in this world, its guilty authors being neither reproved
nor reformed.</P>

<P>7. You have, in the exercise of your judgment, laid down the principles by which a bishop should
be influenced; and after saying that your town has fallen disastrously by a grievous misdemeanour on
the part of your citizens, which must be punished with great severity if they are dealt with
according to the rigour of the civil law, you add: "But a bishop is guided by another law; his duty
is to promote the welfare of men, to interest himself in any case only with a view to the benefit of
the parties, and to obtain for other men the pardon of their sins at the hand of the Almighty
God."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4369_1848545">686</A></SUP> This we by all means labour to
secure, that no one be visited with undue severity of punishment, either by us or by any other who is
influenced by our interposition; and we seek to promote the true welfare of men, which consists in
the blessedness of well-doing, not in the assurance of impunity in evil-doing. We do also seek
earnestly, not for ourselves alone, but on behalf of others, the pardon of sin: but this we cannot
obtain, except for those who have been turned by correction from the practice of sin. You add,
moreover: "I beseech you with all possible urgency to secure that if the matter is to be made the
subject of a prosecution, the guiltless be protected, and a distinction drawn between the innocent
and those who did the wrong."</P>

<P>8. Listen to a brief account of what was done, and let the distinction between innocent and guilty
be drawn by yourself. In defiance of the most recent laws,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4371_1849477">687</A></SUP> certain impious rites were celebrated on the
Pagan feast-day, the calends of June, no one interfering to forbid them, and with such unbounded
effrontery that a most insolent multitude passed along the street in which the church is situated,
and went on dancing in front of the building,-an outrage which was never committed even in the time
of Julian. When the clergy endeavoured to stop this most illegal and insulting procedure, the church
was assailed with stones. About eight days after that, when the bishop had called the attention of
the authorities to the well-known laws on the subject, and they were preparing to carry out that
which the law prescribed, the church was a second time assailed with stones. When, on the following
day, our people wished to make such complaint as they deemed necessary in open court, in order to
make these villains afraid, their rights as citizens were denied them. On the same day there was a
storm of hailstones, that they might be made afraid, if not by men, at least by the divine power,
thus requiting them for their showers of stones against the church; but as soon as this was over they
renewed the attack for the third time with stones, and at last endeavoured to destroy both the
buildings and the men in them by fire: one servant of God who lost his way and met them they killed
on the spot, all the rest escaping or concealing themselves as they best could; while the bishop hid
himself in some crevice into which he forced himself with difficulty, and in which he lay folded
double while he heard the voices of the ruffians seeking him to kill him, and expressing their
mortification that through his escaping them their principal design in this grievous outrage had been
frustrated. These things went on from about the tenth hour until the night was far advanced. No
attempt at resistance or rescue was made by those whose authority might have had influence on the
mob. The only one who interfered was a stranger, through whose exertions a number of the servants of
God were delivered from the hands of those who were trying to kill them, and a great deal of property
was recovered from the plunderers by force: whereby it. was shown how easily these riotous
proceedings might have been either prevented wholly or arrested, if the citizens, and especially the
leading men, had forbidden them, either from the first or after they had begun.</P>

<P>9. Accordingly you cannot in that community draw a distinction between innocent and guilty
persons, for all are guilty; but perhaps you may distinguish degrees of guilt. Those are in a
comparatively small fault, who, being kept back by fear, especially by fear of offending those whom
they knew to have leading influence in the community and to be hostile to the Church, did not dare to
render assistance to the Christians; but all are guilty who consented to these outrages, though they
neither perpetrated them nor instigated others to the crime: more guilty are those who perpetrated
the wrong, and most guilty are those who instigated them to it. Let us, however, suppose that the
instigation of others to these crimes is a matter of suspicion rather than of certain knowledge, and
let us not investigate those things which can be found out in no other way than by subjecting
witnesses to torture. Let us also forgive those who through fear thought it better for them to plead
secretly with God for the bishop and His other servants, than openly to displease the powerful
enemies of the Church. What reason can you give for holding that those who remain should be subjected
to no correction and restraint? Do you really think that a case of such cruel rage should be held up
to the world as passing unpunished? We do not desire to gratify our anger by vindictive retribution
for the past, but we are concerned to make provision in a truly merciful spirit for the future. Now,
wicked men have something in respect to which they may be punished, and that by Christians, in a
merciful way, and so as to promote their own profit and well-being. For they have these three things:
the life and health of the body, the means of supporting that life, and the means and opportunities
of living a wicked life. Let the two former remain untouched in the possession of those who repent of
their crime: this we desire, and this we spare no pains to secure. But as to the third, upon it God
will, if it please Him, inflict punishment in His great compassion, dealing with it as a decaying or
diseased part, which must be removed with the pruning-knife. If, however, He be pleased either to go
beyond this, or not to permit the punishment to go so far, the reason for this higher and doubtless
more righteous counsel remains with Him: our duty is to devote pains and use our influence according
to the light which is granted to us, beseeching His approval of our endeavours to do that which shall
be most for the good of all, and praying Him not to permit us to do anything which He who knoweth all
things much better than we do sees to be inexpedient both for ourselves and for His Church.</P>

<P>10. When I went recently to Calama, that under so grievous sorrow I might either comfort the
downcast or soothe the indignant among our people, I used all my influence with the Christians to
persuade them to do what I judged to be their duty at that time. I then at their own request admitted
to an audience the Pagans also, the source and cause of all this mischief, in order that I might
admonish them what they should do if they were wise, not only for the removal of present anxiety, but
also for the obtaining of everlasting salvation. They listened to many things which I said, and they
preferred many requests to me; but far be it from me to be such a servant as to find pleasure in
being petitioned by those who do not humble themselves before my Lord to ask from Him. With your
quick intelligence, you will readily perceive that our aim must be, while preserving Christian
gentleness and moderation, to act so that we may either make others afraid of imitating their
perversity, or have cause to desire others to imitate their profiling by correction. As for the loss
sustained, this is either borne by the Christians or remedied by the help of their brethren. What
concerns us is the gaining of souls, which even at the risk of life we are impatient to secure; and
our desire is, that in your district we may have larger success, and that in other districts we may
not be hindered by the influence of your example. May God in His mercy grant to us to rejoice in your
salvation!</P>

</UL><P>(a.d.: 408.)</P>

  <UL><P><I>To the Noble and Justly Distinguished Lady Italica, a Daughter Worthy of Honour in the
Love of Christ, Bishop Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. I have learned, not only by your letter, but also by the statements of the person who
brought it to me, that you earnestly solicit a letter from me, believing that you may derive from it
very great consolation. What you may gain from my letter it is for yourself to judge; I at least felt
that I should neither refuse nor delay compliance with your request. May your own faith and hope
comfort you, and that love which is shed abroad in the hearts of the pious by the Holy Ghost,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4379_1856847">688</A></SUP> whereof we have now a portion as an earnest of
the whole, in order that we may learn to desire its consummate fulness. For you ought not to consider
yourself desolate while you have Christ dwelling in your heart by faith; nor ought you to sorrow as
those heathens who have no hope, seeing that in regard to those friends, who are not lost, but only
called earlier than ourselves to the country whither we shall follow them, we have hope, resting on a
most sure promise, that from this life we shall pass into that other life, in which they shall be to
us more beloved as they shall be better known, and in which our pleasure in loving them shall not be
alloyed by any fear of separation.</P>

<P>2. Your late husband, by whose decease you are now a widow, was truly well known to you, but
better known to himself than to you. And how could this be, when you saw his face, which he himself
did not see, if it were not that the inner knowledge which we have of ourselves is more certain,
since no man "knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in man "?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4381_1857927">689</A></SUP> but when the Lord cometh, "who both will bring
to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4382_1858087">690</A></SUP> then shall nothing in any one be concealed from
his neighbour; nor shall there be anything which any one might reveal to his friends, but keep hidden
from strangers, for no stranger shall be there. What tongue can describe the nature and the greatness
of that light by which all those things which are now in the hearts of men concealed shall be made
manifest? who can with our weak faculties even approach it? Truly that Light is God Himself, for "God
is Light, and in Him is no darkness at all;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4383_1858606">691</A></SUP> but He is the Light of purified minds, not of
these bodily eyes. And the mind shall then be, what meanwhile it is not, able to see that light.</P>

<P>3. But this the bodily eye neither now is, nor shall then be, able to see. For everything which
can be seen by the bodily eye must be in some place, nor can be everywhere in its totality, but with
a smaller part of itself occupies a smaller space, and with a larger part a larger space. It is not
so with God, who is invisible and incorruptible, "who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light
which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen nor can see."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4385_1859232">692</A></SUP> For He cannot be seen by men through the bodily
organ by which men see corporeal things. For if He were inaccessible to the minds also of the saints,
it would not be said, "They looked unto Him, and were lightened" [translated by Aug., "Draw near unto
Him, and be enlightened"];<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4386_1859533">693</A></SUP> and if He was
invisible to the minds of the saints, it would not be said, "We shall see Him as He is:" for consider
the whole context there in that Epistle of John: "Beloved," he says, "now are we the sons of God; and
it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like
Him; for we shall see Him as He is."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4387_1859907">694</A></SUP> We
shall therefore see Him according to the measure in which we shall be like Him; because now the
measure in which we do not see Him is according to the measure of our unlikeness to Him. We shall
therefore see Him by means of that in which we shall be like Him. But who would be so infatuated as
to assert that we either are or shall be in our bodies like unto God? The likeness spoken of is
therefore in the inner man, "which is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created
him."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4388_1860423">695</A></SUP> And we shall become the more like
unto Him, the more we advance in knowledge of Him and in love; because "though our outward man
perish, our inward man is renewed day by day,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4389_1860620">696</A></SUP> yet so as that, however far one may have become
advanced in this life, he is far short of that perfection of likeness which is fitted for seeing God,
as the apostle says, "face to face."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4390_1860828">697</A></SUP> If
by these words we were to understand the bodily face, it would follow that God has a face such as
ours, and that between our face and His there must be a space intervening when we shall see Him face
to face. And if a space intervene, this presupposes a limitation and a definite conformation of
members and other things, absurd to utter, and impious even to think of, by which most empty
delusions the natural man, which "receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4391_1861326">698</A></SUP> is deceived.</P>

<P>4. For some of those who talk thus foolishly affirm, as I am informed, that we see God now by our
minds, but shall then see Him by our bodies; yea, they even say that the wicked shall in the same
manner see Him. Observe how far they have gone from bad to worse, when, unpunished for their foolish
speaking, they talk at random, unrestrained by either fear or shame. They used to say at first, that
Christ endowed only His own flesh with this faculty of seeing God with the bodily eye; then they
added to this, that all the saints shall see God in the same way then they have received their bodies
again in the resurrection; and now they have granted that the same thing is possible to the wicked
also. Well, let them grant what gifts they please, and to whom they please: for who may say anything
against men giving away that which is their own? for he that speaketh a lie, speaketh of his
own.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4393_1862255">699</A></SUP> Be it yours, however, in common with
all who hold sound doctrine, not to presume to take in this way from your own any of these errors;
but when you read, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4394_1862489">700</A></SUP> learn from it that the impious shall not see
Him: for the impious are neither blessed nor pure in heart. Moreover, when you read, "Now we see
through a glass darkly,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4395_1862674">701</A></SUP> but then face to
face,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4396_1862721">702</A></SUP> learn from this that we shall then
see Him face to face by the same means by which we now see Him through a glass darkly. In both cases
alike, the vision of God belongs to the inner man, whether when we walk in this pilgrimage still by
faith, in which it uses the glass and the <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>ai!nigma</FONT>, or when, in the
country which is our home, we shall perceive by sight, which vision the words "face to face"
denote.</P>

<P>5. Let the flesh raving with carnal imaginations hear these words: "God is a Spirit, and they that
worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn43.htm#P4398_1863301">703</A></SUP> If this be the manner of/ worshipping Him, how
much more of seeing Him! For who durst affirm that the Divine essence is seen in a corporal manner,
when He has not permitted it to be worshipped in a corporal manner? They think, however, that they
are very acute in saying and in pressing as a question for us to answer: Was Christ able to endow His
flesh so as that He could with His eyes see the Father, or was He not? If we reply that He was not,
they publish abroad that we have denied the omnipotence of God; if, on the other hand, we grant that
He was able, they affirm that their argument is established by our reply. How much more excusable is
the folly of those who maintain that the flesh shall be changed into the Divine substance, and shall
be what God Himself is, in order that thus they may endow with fitness for seeing God that which is
meanwhile removed by so great diversity of nature from likeness to Him! Yet I believe they reject
from their creed, perhaps also refuse to hear, this error. Nevertheless, if they were in like manner
pressed with the question above quoted, as to whether God can or cannot do this [viz. change our
flesh into the Divine substance], which alternative will they choose? Will they limit His power by
answering that He cannot; or if they concede that He can, will they by this concession grant that it
shall be done? Let them get out of the dilemma which they have proposed to others as above, in the
same way by which they get out of this dilemma proposed to others by them. Moreover, why do they
contend that this gift is to be attributed only to the eyes, and not to all the other senses of
Christ? Shall God then be a sound, that He may be perceived by the ear? and an exhalation, that He
may be discerned by the sense of smell? and a liquid of some kind, that He may be also imbibed? and a
solid body, that He may be also touched? No, they say. What then? we reply; can God be this, or can
He not? If they say He cannot, why do they derogate from the omnipotence of God? If they say He can,
but is not willing, why do they show favour to the eyes alone, and grudge the same honour to the
other senses of Christ? Do they carry their folly just as far as they please? How much better is our
course, who do not prescribe limits to their folly, but would fain prevent them from entering into it
at all!</P>

<P>6. Many things may be brought forward for the confutation of that madness. Meanwhile, however, if
at any time they assail your ears, read this letter to the supporters of such error, and do not count
it too great a labour to write back to me as well as you can what they say in reply. Let me add that
our hearts are purified by faith, because the vision of God is promised to us as the reward of faith.
Now, if this vision of God were to be through the bodily eyes, in vain are the souls of saints
exercised for receiving it; nay, rather, a soul which cherishes such sentiments is not exercised in
itself, but is wholly in the flesh. For where will it dwell more resolutely and fixedly than in that
by means of which it expects that it shall see God? How great an evil this would be I rather leave to
your own intelligence to observe, than labour to prove by a long argument.</P>

<P>May your heart dwell always under the Lord's keeping, noble and justly distinguished lady, and
daughter worthy of honour in the love of Christ: Salute from me, with the respect due to your worth,
your sons, who are along with yourself honourable, and to me dearly beloved in the Lord.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Vincentius, My Brother Dearly Beloved, Augustin Sends Greeting.</I></P>

</UL><P>Chap. I.</P>

<P>1. I have received a letter which I believe to be from you to me: at least I have not thought this
incredible, for the person who brought it is one whom I know to be a Catholic Christian, and who, I
think, would not dare to impose upon me. But even though the letter may perchance not be from yoU, I
have considered it necessary to write a reply to the author, whoever he may be. You know me now to be
more desirous of rest, and earnest in seeking it, than when you knew me in my earlier years at
Carthage, in the lifetime of your immediate predecessor Rogatus. But we are precluded from this rest
by the Donatists, the repression and correction of whom, by the powers which are ordained of God,
appears to me to be labour not in vain. For we already rejoice in the correction of many who hold and
defend the Catholic unity with such sincerity, and are so glad to have been delivered from their
former error, that we admire them with great thankfulness and pleasure. Yet these same persons, under
some indescribable bondage of custom, would in no way have thought of being changed to a better
condition, had they not, under the shock of this alarm, directed their minds earnestly to the study
of the truth; fearing lest, if without profit, and in vain, they suffered hard things at the hands of
men, for the sake not of righteousness, but of their own obstinacy and presumption, they should
afterwards receive nothing else at the hand of God than the punishment due to wicked men who despised
the admonition which He so gently gave and His paternal correction; and being by such reflection made
teachable, they found not in mischievous or frivolous human fables, but in the promises of the divine
books, that universal Church which they saw extending according to the promise throughout all
nations: just as, on the testimony of prophecy in the same Scriptures, they believed without
hesitation that Christ is exalted above the heavens, though He is not seen by them in His glory. Was
it my duty to be displeased at the salvation of these men, and to call back my colleagues from a
fatherly diligence of this kind, the result of which has been, that we see many blaming their former
blindness? For they see that they were blind who believed Christ to have been exalted above the
heavens although they saw Him not, and .yet denied that His glory is spread over all the earth
although they saw it; whereas the prophet has with so great plainness included both in one sentence,
"Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4407_1869482">704</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2. Wherefore, if we were so to overlook and forbear with those cruel enemies who seriously disturb
our peace and quietness by manifold and grievous forms of violence and treachery, as that nothing at
all should be contrived and done by us with a view to alarm and correct them, truly we would be
rendering evil for evil. For if any one saw his enemy running headlong to destroy himself when he had
become delirious through a dangerous fever, would he not in that case be much more truly rendering
evil for evil if he permitted him to run on thus, than if he took measures to have him seized and
bound? And yet he would at that moment appear to the other to be most vexatious, and most like an
enemy, when, in truth, he had proved himself most useful and most compassionate; although, doubtless,
when health was recovered, would he express to him his gratitude with a warmth proportioned to the
measure in which he had felt his refusal to indulge him in his time of phrenzy. Oh, if I could but
show you how many we have even from the Circumcelliones, who are now approved Catholics, and condemn
their former life, and the wretched delusion under which they believed that they were doing in behalf
of the Church of God whatever they did under the promptings of a restless temerity, who nevertheless
would not have been brought to this soundness of judgment had they not been, as persons beside
themselves, bound with the cords of those laws which are distasteful to you! As to another form of
most serious distemper,-that, namely, of those who had not, indeed, a boldness leading to acts of
violence, but were pressed down by a kind of inveterate sluggishness of mind, and would say to us:
"What you affirm is true, nothing can be said against it; but it is hard for us to leave off what we
have received, by tradition from our fathers,"-why should not such persons be shaken up in a
beneficial way by a law bringing upon them inconvenience in worldly things, in order that they might
rise from their lethargic sleep, and awake to the salvation which is to be found in the unity of the
Church? How many of them, now rejoicing with us, speak bitterly of the weight with which their
ruinous course formerly oppressed them, and confess that it was our duty to inflict annoyance upon
them, in order to prevent them from perishing under the disease of lethargic habit, as under a fatal
sleep!</P>

<P>3. You will say that to some these remedies are of no serviceIs the art of healing, therefore, to
be abandoned, because the malady of some is incurable? You look only to the case of those who are so
obdurate that they refuse even such correction. Of such it is written, "In vain have I smitten your
children: they received no correction:"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4410_1872228">705</A></SUP>
and yet I suppose that those of whom the prophet speaks were smitten in love, not from hatred. But
you ought to consider also the very large number over whose salvation we rejoice. For if they were
only made afraid, and not instructed, this might appear to be a kind of inexcusable tyranny. Again,
if they were instructed only, and not made afraid, they would be with more difficulty persuaded to
embrace the way of salvation, having become hardened through the inveteracy of custom: whereas many
whom we know well, when arguments had been brought before them, and the truth made apparent by
testimonies from the word of God, answered us that they desired to pass into the communion of the
Catholic Church, but were in fear of the violence of worthless men, whose enmity they would incur;
which violence they ought indeed by all means to despise when it was to be borne for righteousness'
sake, and for the sake of eternal life. Nevertheless the weakness of such men ought not to be
regarded as hopeless, but to be supported until they gain more strength. Nor may we for-get what the
Lord Himself said to Peter when he was yet weak: "Thou canst not follow Me now, but thou shall follow
Me afterwards."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4411_1873450">706</A></SUP> When, however, wholesome
instruction is added to means of inspiring salutary fear, so that not only the light of truth may
dispel the darkness of error, but the force of fear may at the same time break the bonds of evil
custom, we are made glad, as I have said, by the salvation of many, who with us bless God, and render
thanks to Him, because by the fulfilment of His covenant, in which He promised that the kings of the
earth should serve Christ, He has thus cured the diseased and restored health to the weak.</P>

<P>Chap. II.</P>

<P>4. Not every one who is indulgent is a friend; nor is every one an enemy who smites. Better are
the wounds of a friend than the proffered kisses of an enemy.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4414_1874152">707</A></SUP> It is better with severity to love, than with
gentleness to deceive. More good is done by taking away food from one who is hungry, if, through
freedom from care as to his food, he is forgetful of righteousness, than by providing bread for one
who is hungry, in order that, being thereby bribed,;he may consent to unrighteousness. He who binds
the man who is in a phrenzy, and he who stirs up the man who is in a lethargy, are alike vexatious to
both, and are in both cases alike prompted by love for the patient. Who can love us more than God
does? And yet He not only give us sweet instruction, but also quickens us by salutary fear, and this
unceasingly. Often adding to the soothing remedies by which He comforts men the sharp medicine of
tribulation, He afflicts with famine even the pious and devout patriarchs,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4415_1874991">708</A></SUP> disquiets a rebellious people by more severe
chastisements, and refuses, though thrice besought, to take away the thorn in the flesh of the
apostle, that He may make His strength perfect in weakness.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4416_1875238">709</A></SUP> Let us by all means love even our enemies, for
this is right, and God commands us so to do, in order that we may be the children of our Father who
is in heaven, "who maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
and on the unjust."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4417_1875529">710</A></SUP> But as we praise
these His gifts, lets us in like manner ponder His correction of those whom He loves.</P>

<P>5. You are of opinion that no one should be compelled to follow righteousness; and yet you read
that the householder said to his servants, "Whomsoever ye shall find, compel them to come in."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4419_1875842">711</A></SUP> You also read how he who was at first Saul, and
afterwards Paul, was compelled, by the great violence with which Christ coerced him, to know an.d to
embrace the truth; for you cannot but think that the light which your eyes enjoy is more precious to
men than money or any other possession. This light, lost suddenly by him when he was cast to the
ground by the heavenly voice, he did not recover until he became a member of the Holy Church. You are
also of opinion that no coercion is to be used with any man in order to his deliverance from the
fatal consequences of error; and yet you see that, in examples which cannot be disputed, this is done
by God, who loves us with more real regard for our profit than any other can; and you hear Christ
saying, "No man can come to me except the Father draw him,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4420_1876669">712</A></SUP> which is done in the hearts of all those who,
through fear of the wrath of God, betake themselves to Him. You know also that sometimes the thief
scatters food before the flock that he may lead them astray, and sometimes the shepherd brings
wandering sheep back to the flock with his rod.</P>

<P>6. Did not Sarah, when she had the power, choose rather to afflict the insolent bondwoman? And
truly she did not cruelly hate her whom she had formerly by an act of her own kindness made a mother;
but she put a wholesome restraint upon her pride.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4422_1877224">713</A></SUP> Moreover, as you well know, these two women,
Sarah and Hagar, and their two sons Isaac and Ishmael, are figures representing spiritual and carnal
persons. And although we read that the bondwoman and her son suffered great hardships from Sarah,
nevertheless the Apostle Paul says that Isaac suffered persecution from Ishmael: "But as then he that
was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4423_1877682">714</A></SUP> whence those who have understanding may perceive
that it is rather the Catholic Church which suffers persecution through the pride and impiety of
those carnal men whom it endeavours to correct by afflictions and terrors of a temporal kind.
Whatever therefore the true and rightful Mother does, even when something severe and bitter is felt
by her children at her hands, she is not rendering evil for evil, but is applying the benefit of
discipline to counteract the evil of sin, not with the hatred which seeks to harm, but with the love
which seeks to heal. When good and bad do the same actions and suffer the same afflictions, they are
to be distinguished not by what they do or suffer, but by the causes of each: <I>e.g.</I> Pharaoh
oppressed the people of God by hard bondage; Moses afflicted the same people by severe correction
when they were guilty of impiety:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4424_1878564">715</A></SUP> their
actions were alike; but they were not alike in the motive of regard to the people's welfare,-the one
being inflated by the lust of power, the other inflamed by love. Jezebel slew prophets, Elijah slew
false prophets;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4425_1878818">716</A></SUP> I suppose that the desert
of the actors and of the sufferers respectively in the two cases was wholly diverse.</P>

<P>7. Look also to the New Testament times, in which the essential gentleness of love was to be not
only kept in the heart, but also manifested openly: in these the sword of Peter is called back into
its sheath by Christ, and we are taught that it ought not to be taken from its sheath even in
Christ's defence.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4427_1879266">717</A></SUP> We read, however, not
only that the Jews beat the Apostle Paul, but also that the Greeks beat Sosthenes, a Jew, on account
of the Apostle Paul.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4428_1879433">718</A></SUP> Does not the
similarity of the events apparently join both; and, at the same time, does not the dissimilarity of
the causes make a real difference? Again, God spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4429_1879673">719</A></SUP> for us all.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4430_1879704">720</A></SUP> Of the Son also it is said, "who loved me, and
gave Himself<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4431_1879786">721</A></SUP> for me;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4432_1879814">722</A></SUP> and it is also said of Judas that Satan entered
into him that he might betray<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4433_1879912">723</A></SUP>
Christ.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4434_1879936">724</A></SUP> Seeing, therefore, that the
Father delivered up His Son, and Christ delivered up His own body, and Judas delivered up his Master,
wherefore is God holy and man guilty in this delivering up of Christ, unless that in the one action
which both did, the reason for which they did it was not the same? Three crosses stood in one place:
on one was the thief who was to be saved; on the second, the thief who was to be condemned; on the
third, between them, was Christ, who was about to save the one thief and condemn the other. What
could be more similar than these crosses? what more unlike than the persons who were suspended on
them? Paul was given up to be imprisoned and bound,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4435_1880634">725</A></SUP> but Satan is unquestionably worse than any
gaoler: yet to him Paul himself gave up one man for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit
might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4436_1880845">726</A></SUP> And what say we to this? Behold, both deliver a
man to bondage; but he that is cruel consigns his prisoner to one less severe, while he that is
compassionate consigns his to one who is more cruel. Let us learn, my brother, in actions which are
similar to distinguish the intentions of the agents; and let us not, shutting our eyes, deal in
groundless reproaches, and accuse those who seek men's welfare as if they did them wrong. In like
manner, when the same apostle says that he had delivered certain persons unto Satan, that they might
learn not to blaspheme,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4437_1881428">727</A></SUP> did he render to
these men evil for evil, or did he not rather esteem it a good work to correct evil men by means of
the evil one?</P>

<P>8. If to suffer persecution were in all cases a praiseworthy thing, it would have sufficed for the
Lord to say, "Blessed are they which are persecuted," without adding "for righteousness'
sake."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4439_1881774">728</A></SUP> Moreover, if to inflict
persecution were in all cases blameworthy, it would not have been written in the sacred books, "Whoso
privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I persecute [cut off, E.V.]."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4440_1881993">729</A></SUP> In some cases, therefore, both he that suffers
persecution is in the wrong, and he that inflicts it is in the right. But the truth is, that always
both the bad have persecuted the good, and the good have persecuted the bad: the former doing harm by
their un-righteousness, the latter seeking to do good by the administration of discipline; the former
with cruelty, the latter with moderation; the former impelled by lust, the latter under the
constraint of love. For he whose aim is to kill is not careful how he wounds, but he whose aim is to
cure is cautious with his lancet; for the one seeks to destroy what is sound, the other that which is
decaying. The wicked put prophets to death; prophets also put the wicked to death. The Jews scourged
Christ; Christ also scourged the Jews. The apostles were given up by men to the civil powers; the
apostles themselves gave men up to the power of Satan. In all these cases, what is important to
attend to but this: who were on the side of truth, and who on the side of iniquity; who acted from a
desire to injure, and who from a desire to correct what was amiss?</P>

<P>Chap. III.</P>

<P>9. You say that no example is found in the writings of evangelists and apostles, of any petition
presented on behalf of the Church to the kings of the earth against her enemies. Who denies this?
None such is found. But at that time the prophecy, "Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be
instructed, ye judges of the earth: serve the Lord with fear," was not yet fulfilled. Up to that time
the words which we find at the beginning of the same Psalm were receiving their fulfilment, "Why do
the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the
rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against His Anointed."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4443_1883794">730</A></SUP> Truly, if past events recorded in the prophetic
books were figures of the future, there was given under King Nebuchadnezzar a figure both of the time
which the Church had under the apostles, and of that which she has now. In the age of the apostles
and martyrs, that was fulfilled which was prefigured when the aforesaid king compelled pious and just
men to bow down to his image, and cast into the flames all who refused. Now, however, is fulfilled
that which was prefigured soon after in the same king, when, being converted to the worship of the
true God, he made a decree throughout his empire, that whosoever should speak against the God of
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, should suffer the penalty which their crime deserved. The earlier
time of that king represented the former age of emperors who did not believe in Christ, at whose
hands the Christians suffered because of the wicked; but the later time of that king represented the
age of the successors to the imperial throne, now believing in Christ, at whose hands the wicked
suffer because of the Christians.</P>

<P>10. It is manifest, however, that moderate severity, or rather clemency, is carefully observed
towards those who, under the Christian name, have been led astray by perverse men, in the measures
used to prevent them who are Christ's sheep from wandering, and to bring them back to the flock, when
by punishments, such as exile and fines, they are admonished to consider what they suffer, and
wherefore, and are taught to prefer the Scriptures which they read to human legends and calumnies.
For which of us, yea, which of you, does not speak well of the laws issued by the emperors against
heathen sacrifices? In these, assuredly, a penalty much more severe has been appointed, for the
punishment of that impiety is death. But in repressing and restraining you, the thing aimed at has
been rather that you should be admonished to depart from evil, than that you should be punished for a
crime. For perhaps what the apostle said of the Jews may be said of you: "bear them record that they
have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge: for, being ignorant of the righteousness of God,
and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to the
righteousness of God."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4445_1886102">731</A></SUP> For what else than
your own righteousness are you desiring to establish, when you say that none are justified but those
who may have had the opportunity of being baptized by you? In regard to this statement made by the
apostle concerning the Jews, you differ from those to whom it originally applied in this, that you
have the Christian sacraments, of which they are still destitute. But in regard to the words, "being
ignorant. of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness," and "they
have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge," you are exactly like them, excepting only those
among you who know what is the truth, and who in the wilfulness of their perversity continue to fight
against truth which is perfectly well known to them. The impiety of these men is perhaps even a
greater sin than idolatry. Since, however, they cannot be easily convicted of this (for it is a sin
which lies concealed in the mind), you are all alike restrained with a comparatively gentle severity,
as being not so far alienated from us. And this I may say, both concerning all heretics without
distinction, who, while retaining the Christian sacraments, are dissenters from the truth and unity
of Christ, and concerning all Donatists without exception.</P>

<P>11. But as for you, who are not only, in common with these last, styled Donatists, from Donatus,
but also specially named Rogatists, from Rogatus, you indeed seem to be more gentle in disposition,
because you do not rage up and down with bands of these savage Circumcelliones: but no wild beast is
said to be gentle if,because of its not having teeth and claws, it! wounds no one. You say that you
have no wish to be cruel: I think that power, not will is wanting to you. For you are in number so
few, that even if you desire it, you dare not move against the multitudes which are opposed to you.
Let us suppose, however, that you do not wish to do that which you have not strength to do; let us
suppose that the gospel rule, "If any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him
have thy cloak also,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4447_1888214">732</A></SUP> is so understood
and obeyed by you that resistance to those who persecute you is unlawful, whether they have right or
wrong on their side. Rogatus, the founder of your sect, either did not hold this view, or was guilty
of inconsistency; for he fought with the keenest determination in a lawsuit about certain things
which, according to your statement, belonged to you. If to him it had been said, Which of the
apostles ever defended his property in a matter concerning faith by appeal to the civil courts? as
you have put the question in your letter, "Which of the apostles ever invaded the property of other
men in a matter concerning faith?" he could not find any example of this in the Divine writings; but
he might perhaps have found some true defence if he had not separated himself from the true Church,
and then audaciously claimed to hold in the name of the true Church the disputed possession.</P>

<P>Chap. IV.</P>

<P>12. As to the obtaining or putting in force of edicts of the powers of this world against
schismatics and heretics, those from whom you separated yourselves were very activein this matter,
both against you, so far as we have heard, and against the followers of Maximianus, as we prove by
the indisputable evidence of their own Records; but you had not yet separated yourselves from them at
the time when in their petition they said to the Emperor Julian that "nothing but righteousness found
a place with him,"-a man whom all the while they knew to be an apostate, and whom they saw to be so
given over to idolatry, that they must either admit idolatry to be righteousness, or be unable to
deny that they had wickedly lied when they said that nothing but righteousness had a place with him
with whom they saw that idolatry had so large a place. Grant, however, that that was a mistake in the
use of words, what say you as to the deed itself? If not even that which is just is to be sought by
appeal to an emperor, why was that which was by you supposed to be just sought from Julian?</P>

<P>13. Do you reply that it is lawful to petition the Emperor in order to recover what is one's own,
but not lawful to accuse another in order that he may be coerced by the Emperor? I may remark, in
passing, that in even petitioning for the recovery of what is one's own, the ground covered by
apostolic example is abandoned, because no apostle is found to have ever done this. But apart from
this, when your predecessors brought before the Emperor Constantine, by means of the proconsul
Anulinus, their accusations against Caecilianus, who was then bishop of Carthage, with whom as a
guilty person they refused to have communion, they were not endeavouring to recover something of
their own which they had lost, but were by calumnies assailing one who was, as we think, and as the
issue of the judicial proceedings showed, an innocent man; and what more heinous crime could have
been perpetrated by them than this? If, however, as you erroneously suppose, they did in his case
deliver up to the judgment of the civil powers a man who was indeed guilty, why do you object to our
doing that which your own party first presumed to do, and for doing which we would not find fault
with them, if they had done it not with an envious desire to do harm, but with the intention of
reproving and correcting what was wrong. But we have no hesitation in finding fault with you, who
think that we are criminal in bringing any complaint before a Christian emperor against the enemies
of our communion, seeing that a document given by your predecessors to Anulinus the proconsul, to be
forwarded by him to the Emperor Constantine, bore this superscription: "Libellus Ecclesiae
Catholicae, criminum Caeciliani, traditus a parte Majorini."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4451_1891949">733</A></SUP> We find fault, moreover, with them more
particularly, because when they had of their own accord gone to the Emperor with accusations against
Caecilianus, which they ought by all means to have in the first place proved before those who were
his colleagues beyond the sea, and when the Emperor, acting in a much more orderly way than they had
done, referred to bishops the decision of this case pertaining to bishops which had been brought
before him, they, even when defeated by a decision against them, would not come to peace with their
brethren. Instead of this, they next accused at the bar of the temporal sovereign, not Caecilianus
only, but also the bishops who had been appointed judges; and finally, from a second episcopal
tribunal they appealed to the Emperor again. Nor did they consider it their duty to yield either to
truth or to peace when he himself inquired into the case and gave his decision. </P>

<P>14. Now what else could Constantine have decreed against Caecilianus and his friends, if they had
been defeated when your predecessors accused them, than the things decreed against the very men who,
having of their own accord brought the accusations, and having failed to prove what they alleged,
refused even when defeated to acquiesce in the truth? The Emperor, as you know, in that case decreed
for the first time that the property of those who were convicted of schism and obstinately resisted
the unity of the Church should be confiscated. If, however, the issue had been that your predecessors
who brought the accusations had gained their case, and the Emperor had made some such decree against
the communion to which Caecilianus belonged, you would have wished the emperors to be called the
friends of the Church's interests, and the guardians of her peace and unity. But when such things are
decreed by emperors against the parties who, having of their own accord brought forward accusations,
were unable to substantiate them, and who, when a. welcome back to the bosom of peace was offered to
them on condition of their amendment, refused the terms, an outcry is raised that this is an unworthy
wrong, and it is maintained that no one ought to be coerced to unity, and that evil should not be
requited for evil to any one. What else is this than what one of yourselves wrote: "What we wish is
holy "?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4453_1894305">734</A></SUP> And in view of these things, it
was not a great or difficult thing for you to reflect and discover how the decree and sentence of
Constantine, which was published against you on the occasion of your predecessors so frequently
bringing before the Emperor charges which they could not make good, should be in force against you;
and how all succeeding emperors, especially those who are Catholic Christians, necessarily act
according. to it as often as the exigencies of your obstinacy make it necessary for them to take any
measures in regard to you.</P>

<P>15. It was an easy thing for you to have reflected on these things, and perhaps some time to have
said to yourselves: Seeing that Caecilianus either was innocent, or at least could not be proved
guilty, what sin has the Christian Church spread so far and wide through the world committed in this
matter? On what ground could it be unlawful for the Christian world to remain: ignorant of that which
even those who made it matter of accusation against others could not prove? Why should those whom
Christ has sown in His field, that is, in this world, and has commanded to grow alongside of the
tares until. the harvest,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4455_1895518">735</A></SUP> -those many
thousands of believers in all nations, whose multitude the Lord compared to the stars of heaven and
the sand of the sea, to whom He promised of old, and has now given, the blessing in the seed of
Abraham,-why, I ask, should the name of Christians be denied to all these, because, forsooth, in
regard to this case, in the discussion of which they took no part, they preferred to believe the
judges, who under grave responsibility gave their decision, rather than the plaintiffs, against whom
the decision was given? Surely no man's crime can stain with guilt another who does not know of its
commission. How could the faithful, scattered throughout the world, be cognisant of the crime of
surrendering the sacred books as committed by men, whose guilt their accusers, even if they knew it,
were at least unable to drove? Unquestionably this one fact of ignorance on their part most easily
demonstrates that they had no share in the guilt of this crime. Why then should the innocent be
charged with crimes which they never committed, because of their being ignorant of crimes which,
justly or unjustly, are laid to the charge of others? What room is left for innocence, if it is
criminal for one to be ignorant of the crimes of others? Moreover, if the mere fact of their
ignorance proves, as has been said, the innocence of the people in so many nations, how great is the
crime of separation from the communion of these innocent people! For the deeds of guilty parties
which either cannot be proved to those who are innocent, or cannot be believed by them, bring no
stain upon any one, since, even when known, they are borne with in order to preserve fellowship with
those who are innocent. For the good are not to be deserted for the sake of the wicked, but the
wicked are to be borne with for the sake of the good; as the prophets bore with those against whom
they delivered such testimonies, and did not cease to take part in the sacraments of the Jewish
people; as also our Lord bore with guilty Judas, even until he met the end which he deserved, and
permitted him to take part in the sacred supper along with the innocent disciples; as the apostles
bore with those who preached Christ through envy,-a sin peculiarly satanic;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4456_1897786">736</A></SUP> as Cyprian bore with colleagues guilty of
avarice, which, after the example of the apostle,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4457_1897902">737</A></SUP> he calls idolatry. In fine, whatever was done at
that time among these bishops, although perhaps it was known by some of them, is, unless there be
respect of persons in judgment, unknown to all: why, then, is not peace loved by all? These thoughts
might easily occur to you; perhaps you already entertain them. But it would be better for you to be
devoted to earthly possessions, through fear of losing which you might be proved to consent to known
truth, than to be devoted to that worthless vainglory which you think you will by such consent
forfeit in the estimation of men.</P>

<P>Chap. V.</P>

<P>16. You now see therefore, I suppose, that the thing to be considered when any one is coerced, is
not the mere fact of the coercion, but the nature of that to which he is coerced, whether it be good
or bad: not that any one can be good in spite of his own will, but that, through fear of suffering
what he does not desire, he either renounces his hostile prejudices, or is compelled to examine truth
of which he had been contentedly ignorant; and under the influence of this fear repudiates the error
which he was wont to defend, or seeks the truth of which he formerly knew nothing, and now willingly
holds what he formerly rejected. Perhaps it would be utterly useless to assert this in words, if it
were not demonstrated by so many examples. We see not a few men here and there, but many cities, once
Donatist, now Catholic, vehemently detesting the diabolical schism, and ardently loving the unity of
the Church; and these became Catholic under the influence of that fear which is to you so offensive
by the laws of emperors, from Constantine, before whom your party of their own accord impeached
Caecilianus, down to the emperors of our own time, who most justly decree that the decision of the
judge whom your own party chose, and whom they preferred to a tribunal of bishops, should be
maintained in force against you.</P>

<P>17. I have therefore yielded to the evidence afforded by these instances which my colleagues have
laid before me. For originally my opinion was, that no one should be coerced into the unity of
Christ, that we must act only by words, fight only by arguments, and prevail by force of reason, lest
we should have those whom we knew as avowed heretics feigning themselves to be Catholics. But this
opinion of mine was overcome not by the words of those who controverted it, but by the conclusive
instances to which they could point. For, in the first place, there was set over against my opinion
my own town, which, although it was once wholly on the side of Donatus, was brought over to the
Catholic unity by fear of the imperial edicts, but which we now see filled with such detestation of
your ruinous perversity, that it would scarcely be believed that it had ever been .involved in your
error. There were so many others which were mentioned to me by name, that, from facts themselves, I
was, made to own that to this matter the word of Scripture might be understood as applying: "Give
opportunity to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4461_1900973">738</A></SUP> For how many were already, as we assuredly know,
willing to be Catholics, being I moved by the indisputable plainness of truth, but daily putting off
their avowal of this through fear of offending their own party! How many were bound, not by truth-for
you never pretended to that as yours-but by the heavy chains of inveterate custom, so that in them
was fulfilled the divine saying: "A servant (who is hardened) will not be corrected by words; for
though he understand, he will not answer"!<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4462_1901485">739</A></SUP> How many supposed the sect of Donatus to be the
true Church, merely because ease had made them too listless, or conceited, or sluggish, to take pains
to examine Catholic truth! How many would have entered earlier had not the calumnies of slanderers,
who declared that we offered something else than we do upon the altar of God, shut them out! How
many, believing that it mattered not to which party a Christian might belong, remained in the schism
of Donatus only because they had been born in it, and no one was compelling them to forsake it and
pass over into the Catholic Church!</P>

<P>18. To all these classes of persons the dread of those laws in the promulgation of which kings
serve the Lord in fear has been so useful, that now some say we were willing for this some time ago;
but thanks be to God, who has given us occasion for doing it at once, and has cut off the hesitancy
of procrastination! Others say: We already knew this to be true, but we were held prisoners by the
force of old custom: thanks be to the Lord, who has broken these bonds asunder, and has brought us
into the bond of peace! Others say: We knew not that the truth was here, and we had no wish to learn
it; but fear made us become earnest to examine it when we became alarmed, lest, without any gain in
things eternal, we should be smitten with loss in temporal things: thanks be to the Lord, who has by
the stimulus of fear startled us from our negligence, that now being disquieted we might inquire into
those things which, when at ease, we did not care to know! Others say: We were prevented from
entering the Church by false reports, which we could not know to be false unless we entered it; and
we would not enter unless we were compelled: thanks be to the Lord, who by His scourge took away our
timid hesitation, and taught us to find out for ourselves how vain and absurd were the lies which
rumour had spread abroad against His Church: by this we are persuaded that there is no truth in the
accusations made by the authors of this heresy, since the more serious charges which their followers
have invented are without foundation. Others say: We thought, indeed, that it mattered not in what
communion we held the faith of Christ; but thanks to the Lord, who has gathered us in from a state of
schism, and has taught us that it is fitting that the one God be worshipped in unity.</P>

<P>19. Could I therefore maintain opposition to my colleagues, and by resisting them stand in the way
of such conquests of the Lord, and prevent the sheep of Christ which were wandering on your mountains
and hills-that is, on the swellings of your pride-from being gathered into the fold of peace, in
which there is one flock and one Shepherd?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4465_1904210">740</A></SUP> Was it my duty to obstruct these measures, in
order, forsooth, that you might not lose what you call your own, and might without fear rob Christ of
what is His: that you might frame your testaments according to Roman law, and might by calumnious
accusations break the Testament made with the sanction of Divine law to the fathers, in which it was
written, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed":<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4466_1904646">741</A></SUP> that you might have freedom in your transactions
in the way of buying and selling, and might be emboldened to divide and claim as your own that which
Christ bought by giving Himself as its price: that any gift made over by one of you to another might
remain unchallenged, and that the gift which the God of gods has bestowed upon His children, called
from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4467_1905072">742</A></SUP> might become invalid: that you might not be sent
into exile from the land of your natural birth, and that you might labour to banish Christ from the
kingdom bought with His blood, which extends from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the
earth?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4468_1905345">743</A></SUP> Nay verily; let the kings of the
earth serve Christ by making laws for Him and for His cause. Your predecessors exposed Caecilianus
and his companions to be punished by the kings of the earth for crimes with which they were falsely
charged: let the lions now be turned to break in pieces the bones of the calumniators, and let no
intercession for them be made by Daniel when he has been proved innocent, and set free from the den
in which they meet their doom;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4469_1905826">744</A></SUP> for he

<P>Chap. VI.</P>

<P>20. Save yourself therefore, my brother, while you have this present life, from the wrath which is
to come on the obstinate and the proud. The formidable power of the authorities of this world, when
it assails the truth, gives glorious opportunity of probation to the strong, but puts dangerous
temptation before the weak who are righteous; but when it assists the proclamation of the truth, it
is the means of profitable admonition to the wise, and of unprofitable vexation to t,h,e foolish
among those who have gone astray. For there is no power but of God: whosoever therefore resisteth the
power, resisteth the ordinance of God; for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the
same."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4473_1906768">746</A></SUP> For if the power be on the side of
the truth, and correct any one who was in error, he that is put right by the correction has praise
from the power. If, on the other hand, the power be unfriendly to the truth, and cruelly persecute
any one, he who is crowned victor in this contest receives praise from the power which he resists.
But you do not that which is good, so as to avoid being afraid of the power; unless perchance this is
good, to sit and speak against not one brother,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4474_1907273">747</A></SUP> but against all your brethren that are found
among all nations, to whom the prophets, and Christ, and the apostles bear witness in the words of
Scripture, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;"2and again, "From the rising
of the sun even unto the going down of the same, a pure offering shah be offered unto My name; for My
name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4475_1907693">748</A></SUP> Mark this: "saith the Lord;" not saith Donatus,
or Rogatus, or Vincentius, or Ambrose, or Augustin, but "saith the Lord;" and again, "All tribes of
the earth shall be blessed in Him, and all nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord God,
the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things; and blessed be His glorious name for ever, and the
whole earth shall be filled with His glory: so let it be, so let it be."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4476_1908135">749</A></SUP> And you sit at Cartennae, and with a remnant of
half a score of Rogatists you say, "Let it not be! Let it not be!"</P>

<P>21. You hear Christ speaking thus in the Gospel: "All things must be fulfilled which were written
in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me. Then opened He their
understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4478_1908763">750</A></SUP> You read also in the Acts of the Apostles how
this gospel began at Jerusalem, where the Holy Spirit first filled those hundred and twenty persons,
and went forth thence into Judaea and Samaria, and to all nations, as He had said unto them when He
was about to ascend into heaven, "Ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea,
and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4479_1909198">751</A></SUP> for "their sound went into all the earth, and
their words unto the ends of the world."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4480_1909315">752</A></SUP>
And you contradict the Divine testimonies so firmly established and so clearly revealed, and attempt
to bring about such an absolute confiscation of Christ's heritage., that although repentance is
preached, as He said,: in His name to all nations, whosoever may be in any part of the earth moved by
that preaching, there is for him no possibility of remission of sins, unless he seek and discover
Vincentius of Cartennae, or some one of his nine or ten associates, in their obscurity in the
imperial colony of Mauritania. What will the arrogance of insignificant mortals<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4481_1909917">753</A></SUP> not dare to do? To what extremities will the
presumption of flesh and blood not hurry men? Is this your well-doing, on account of which you are
not afraid of the power? You place this grievous stumbling-block in the way of your own mother's
son,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4482_1910200">754</A></SUP> for whom Christ died,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4483_1910240">755</A></SUP> and who is yet in feeble infancy, not ready to
use strong mete. at requiring to be nursed on a mother's milk;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4484_1910374">756</A></SUP> and you quote against me the works of Hilary, in
order that you may deny the fact of the Church's increase among all nations; even unto the end of the
world, according to the promise which God, in order to subdue your unbelief, confirmed with an oath!
And although you would by all means be most miserable if you stood against this when it was promised,
you even now contradict it when the promise is fulfilled.</P>

<P>Chap. VII.</P>

<P>22. You, however, through your profound erudition, have discovered something which you think
worthy to be alleged as a great objection against the Divine testimonies. For you say, "If we
consider the parts comprehended in the whole world, it is a comparatively small portion in which the
Christian faith is known:" either refusing to see, or pretending not to know, to how many barbarous
nations the gospel has already penetrated, within a space of time so short, that not even Christ's
enemies can doubt that in a little while that shall be accomplished which our Lord foretold, when,
answering the question of His disciples concerning the end of the world, He said, "This gospel of the
kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end
come."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4487_1911610">757</A></SUP> Meanwhile do all you can to
proclaim and to maintain, that even though the gospel be published in Persia and India, as indeed it
has been for a long time, no one who hears it can be in any degree cleansed from his sins, unless he
come to Cartennae, or to the neighbourhood of Cartennae! If you have not expressly said this, it is
evidently through fear lest men should laugh at you; and yet when you do say this, do you refuse that
men should weep for you?</P>

<P>23. You think that you make a very acute remark when you affirm the name Catholic to mean
universal, not in respect to the communion as embracing the whole world, but in respect to the
observance of all Divine precepts and of all the sacraments, as if we (even accepting the position
that the Church is called Catholic because it honestly holds the whole truth, of which fragments here
and there are found in some heresies) rested upon the testimony of this word's signification, and not
upon the promises of God, and so many indisputable testimonies of the truth itself, our demonstration
of the existence of the Church of God in all nations. In fact, however, this is the whole which you
attempt to make us believe, that the Rogatists alone remain worthy of the name Catholics, on the
ground of their observing all the Divine precepts and all the sacraments; and that you are the only
persons in whom the Son of man when He cometh shall find faith.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4489_1913040">758</A></SUP> You must excuse me for saying we do not believe
a word of this. For although, in order to make it possible for that faith to be found in you which
the Lords. said that He would not find on the earth, you may perhaps presume even to say that you are
to be regarded as in heaven, not on earth, we at least have profited by the apostle's warning,
wherein he has taught us that even an angel from heaven must be regarded as accursed if he were to
preach to us any other gospel than that which we have received.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4490_1913568">759</A></SUP> But how can we be sure that we have indisputable
testimony to Christ in the Divine Word, if we do not accept as indisputable the testimony of the same
Word to the Church? For as, however ingenious the complex subtleties which one may contrive against
the simple truth, and however great the mist of artful fallacies with which he may obscure it, any
one who shall proclaim that Christ has not suffered, and has not risen from the dead on the third
day, must be accursed-because we have learned in the truth of the gospel, "that it behoved Christ to
suffer, and to rise from the dead on the third day;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4491_1914188">760</A></SUP> -on the very same grounds must that man be
accursed who shall proclaim that the Church is outside of<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4492_1914311">761</A></SUP> the communion which embraces all nations: for in
the next words of the same passage we learn also that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4493_1914538">762</A></SUP> and we are bound to hold firmly this rule, "If
any preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4494_1914694">763</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Chap. VIII.</P>

<P>24. if, moreover, we do not listen to the claims of the entire sect of Donatists when they pretend
to be the Church of Christ, seeing that they do not allege in proof of this anything from the Divine
Books, how much less, I ask, are we called upon to listen to, the Rogatists, who will not attempt to
interpret; in the interest of their party the words of Scripture: "Where Thou feedest, where Thou
dost rest in the south "!<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4497_1915148">764</A></SUP> For if by this
the southern part of Africa is to be understood,-the district, namely, which is occupied by
Donatists, because it is under a more burning portion of the heavens,-the Maximianists must excel all
the rest of your party, as the flame of their schism broke forth in Byzantium<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4498_1915478">765</A></SUP> and in Tripoli. Let the Arzuges, if they please,
dispute this point with them, and contest that to them more properly this text applies; but how shall
the imperial province of Mauritania, lying rather to the west than to the south, since it refuses to
be called Africa,-how shall it, I say, find in the word "the south"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn44.htm#P4499_1915816">766</A></SUP> a ground for boasting, I do not say against the
world, but against even that sect of Donatus from which the sect of Rogatus, a very small fragment of
that other and larger fragment, has been broken off? For what else is it than superlative impudence
for one to interpret in his own favour any allegorical statements, unless he has also plain
testimonies, by the light of which the obscure meaning of the former may be made manifest.</P>

<P>25. With how much greater force, moreover, may we say to you what we are accustomed to say to all
the Donatists: If any can have good grounds (which indeed none can have) for separating themselves
from the communion of the whole world, and calling their communion the Church of Christ, because of
their having withdrawn warrantably from the communion of all nations,-how do you know that in the
Christian society, which is spread so far and wide, there may not have been some in a very remote
place, from which the fame of their righteousness could not reach you, who had already, before the
date of your separation, separated themselves for some just cause from the communion of the whole
world? How could the Church in that case be found in your sect, rather than in those who were
separated before you? Thus it comes to pass, that so long as you are ignorant of this, you cannot
make with certainty any claim: which is necessarily the portion of all who, in defending the cause of
their party, appeal to their own testimony instead of the testimony of God. For you cannot say, If
this had happened, it could not have escaped our knowledge; for, not going beyond Africa itself, you
cannot tell, when the question is put to you, how many subdivisions of the party of Donatus have
occurred: in connection with which we must especially bear in mind that in your view the smaller the
number of those who separate themselves, the greater is the justice of their cause, and this paucity
of numbers makes them undoubtedly more likely to remain unnoticed. Hence, also, you are by no means
sure that there may not be some righteous persons, few in number, and therefore unknown, dwelling in
some place far remote from the south of Africa, who, long before the party of Donatus had withdrawn
their righteousness from fellowship with the un-righteousness of all other men, had, in their remote
northern region, separated themselves in the same way for some most satisfactory reason, and now are,
by a claim superior to yours, the Church of God, as the spiritual Zion which preceded all your sects
in the matter of warrantable secession, and who interpret in their favour the words of the Psalm,
"Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4501_1918519">767</A></SUP> with much more reason than the party of Donatus
interpret in their favour the words, "Where Thou feedest, where Thou dost rest in the south."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4502_1918683">768</A></SUP> </P>

<P>26. You profess, nevertheless, to be afraid test, when you are compelled by imperial edicts to
consent to unity, the name of God be for a longer time blasphemed by the Jews and the heathen: as if
the Jews were not aware how their own nation Israel, in the beginning of its history, wished to
exterminate by war the two tribes and a half which had received possessions beyond Jordan, when they
thought that these had separated themselves from the unity of their nation.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4504_1919171">769</A></SUP> As to the Pagans, they may indeed with greater
reason reproach us for the laws which Christian emperors have enacted against idolaters; and yet many
of these have thereby been, and are now daily, turned from idols to the living and true God. In fact,
however, both Jews and Pagans, if they thought the Christians to be as insignificant in number as you
are,-who maintain, forsooth, that you alone are Christians,-would not condescend to say anything
against us, but would never cease to treat us with ridicule and contempt. Are you not afraid lest the
Jews should say to you, "If your handful of men be the Church of Christ, what becomes of the
statement of your Apostle Paul, that your Church is described in the words, `Rejoice, thou barren
that bearest not; breakforth and cry, thou that travailest not: for thedesolate hath many more
children than she whichhath an husband;'<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4505_1920076">770</A></SUP>
in which he plainly declaresthe multitude of Christians to surpass that of theJewish Church?" Will
you say to them, "Weare the more righteous because our number is not large;" and do you expect them
not toreply, "Whoever<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4506_1920317">771</A></SUP> you claim to be,
you are not those of whom it is said, `She that was desolate hath <I>many</I> children,' if you are
reduced to so small a number"?</P>

<P>27. Perhaps you will quote against this the example of that righteous man, who along withhis
family was alone found worthy of deliverancewhen the flood came. Do you see then how faryou still are
from being righteous? Most assuredly we do not affirm you to be righteous on theground of this
instance until your associates bereduced to seven, yourself being the eighth person: provided always,
however, that no otherhas, as I was saying, anticipated the party ofDonatus in snatching up that
righteousness, byhaving, in some far distant spot, withdrawn himself along with seven more, under
pressure of some good reason, from communion with thewhole world, and so saved himself from the
floodby which it is overwhelmed. Seeing, therefore,that you do not know whether this may not havebeen
done, and been as entirely unheard of byyou as the name of Donatus is unheard of bymany nations of
Christians in remote countries,you are unable to say with certainty where theChurch is to be found.
For it must be in thatplace in which what you have now done mayhappen to have been at an earlier date
done byothers, if there could possibly be any just reason for your separating yourselves from the
communion of the whole world.</P>

<P>Chap. IX.</P>

<P>28. We, however, are certain that no one could ever have been warranted in separating himself from
the communion of all nations, because every one of us looks for themarks of the Church not in his own
righteousness, but in the Divine Scriptures, and beholdsit actually in existence, according to the
promises. For it is of the Church that it is said,"As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the
daughters;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4510_1922140">772</A></SUP> which could be called on
theone hand "thorns" only by reason of the wickedness of their manners, and on the other
hand"daughters" by reason of their participation inthe same sacraments. Again, it is the Church which
saith, "From the end of the earth have I cried unto Thee when my heart was overwhelmed;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4511_1922465">773</A></SUP> and in another Psalm, "Horror hath kept me back
from<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4512_1922537">774</A></SUP> the wicked that forsake Thy law;"
and, "I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4513_1922703">775</A></SUP> It is the same which says to her Spouse: "Tell
me where Thou feedest, where Thou dost rest at noon: for why should I be as one veiled beside the
flocks of Thy companions?"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4514_1922904">776</A></SUP> This is the
same as is said in another place: "Make known to me Thy right hand, and those who are in heart taught
in wisdom;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4515_1923049">777</A></SUP> in whom, as they shine with
light and glow with love, Thou dost rest as in noontide; lest perchance, like one veiled, that is,
hidden and unknown, I should run, not to Thy flock, but to the flocks of Thy companions, <I>i.e.</I>
of heretics, whom the bride here calls companions, just as He called the thorns<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4516_1923369">778</A></SUP> "daughters," because of common participation in
the sacraments: of which persons it is elsewhere said: "Thou wast a man, mine equal, my guide, my
acquaintance, who didst take sweet food together with me; we walked unto the house of God in company.
Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4517_1923703">779</A></SUP> like Dathan and Abiram, the authors of an
impious schism.</P>

<P>29. It is to the Church also that the answer is given immediately after in the passage quoted
above: "If thou know not thyself,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4519_1923911">780</A></SUP> O thou
fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flocks,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4520_1924023">781</A></SUP> and feed thy kids beside the shepherds'
tents."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4521_1924086">782</A></SUP> Oh, matchless sweetness of the
Bridegroom, who thus replied to her question: "If thou knowest not thyself," He says; as if He said,
"Surely the city which is set upon a mountain cannot be hid;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4522_1924298">783</A></SUP> and therefore, `Thou art not as one veiled, that
thou shouldst run to the flocks of my companions.' For I am the mountain established upon the top of
the mountains, unto which all nations shall come.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4523_1924518">784</A></SUP> `If thou knowest not thyself,' by the knowledge
which thou mayest gain, not in the words of false witnesses, but in the testimonies of My book; `if
thou knowest not thyself,' from such testimony as this concerning thee: `Lengthen thy cords, and
strengthen thy stakes: for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed
shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. Fear not, for thou shall
not be ashamed; neither be thou confounded, for thou shall not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget
the shame of thy youth, and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more: for thy Maker
is thine husband, the Lord of hosts is His name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; the God of
the whole earth shall He be called.' `If thou knowest not thyself,' O thou fairest among women, from
this which hath been said of thee, `The King hath greatly desired thy beauty,' and `instead of thy
fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes upon the earth:'<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4524_1925562">785</A></SUP> if, therefore, `thou know not thyself,' go thy
way forth: I do not cast thee forth, but `go thy way forth,' that of thee it may be said, `They went
out from us, but they were not of us.'<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4525_1925772">786</A></SUP>
`Go thy way forth' by the footsteps of the flocks, not in My footsteps, but in the footsteps of the
flocks; and not of the one flock, but of flocks divided and going astray. `And feed thy kids,' not as
Peter, to whom it is said, `Feed My sheep;'<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4526_1926040">787</A></SUP> but. `Feed thy kids beside the shepherds'
tents,' not beside the tent of the Shepherd, where there is `one fold and one Shepherd'"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4527_1926192">788</A></SUP> But the church knows herself, and thereby
escapes from that lot which has befallen those who did not know themselves to be in her.</P>

<P>30. The same [Church] is spoken of, when, in regard to the fewness of her numbers as compared with
the multitude of the wicked, it is said: "Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4529_1926580">789</A></SUP> And
again, it is of the same Church that it is said with respect to the multitude of her members: "I will
multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4530_1926795">790</A></SUP> For the same Church of holy and good believers
is both small if compared with the number of the wicked, which is greater, and large if considered by
itself; "for the desolate hath more sons than she which hath an husband," and "many shall come from
the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
God."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4531_1927173">791</A></SUP> God, moreover, presents unto
Himself a "numerous people, zealous of good works."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4532_1927277">792</A></SUP> And in the Apocalypse, many thousands "which no
man can number," from every tribe and tongue, are seen clothed in white robes, and with palms of
victory.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4533_1927537">793</A></SUP> It is the same Church which is
occasionally obscured, and, as it were, beclouded by the multitude of offences, when sinners bend the
bow that they may shoot under the darkened moon<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4534_1927738">794</A></SUP> at the upright in heart.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4535_1927787">795</A></SUP> But even at such a time the Church shines in
those who are most firm in their attachment to her. And if, in the Divine promise above quoted, any
distinct application of its two clauses should be made, it is perhaps not without reason that the
seed of Abraham was compared both to the "stars of heaven," and to "the sand which is by the
sea-shore:" that by "the stars" may be understood those who, in number fewer, are more fixed and more
brilliant; and that by "the sand on the sea-shore" may be understood that great multitude of weak and
carnal persons within the Church, who at one time are seen at rest and free while the weather is
calm, but are at another time covered and troubled under the waves of tribulation and temptation.</P>

<P>31. Now, such a troublous time was the time at which Hilary wrote in the passage which you have
thought fit artfully to adduce against so many Divine testimonies, as if by it you could prove that
the Church has perished from the earth.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4537_1928776">796</A></SUP>
You may just as well say that the numerous churches of Galatia had no existence at the time when the
apostle wrote to them: "O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you," that, "having begun in the
Spirit, ye are now made perfect in the flesh?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4538_1929252">797</A></SUP> For thus you would misrepresent that learned
man, who (like the apostle) was sternly rebuking the slow of heart and the timid, for whom he was
travailing in birth a second time, until Christ should be formed in them.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4539_1929492">798</A></SUP> For who does not know that many persons of weak
judgment were at that time deluded by ambiguous phrases, so that they thought that the Arians
believed the same doctrines as they themselves held; and that others, through fear, had yielded and
feigned consent, not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, to whom you would have
denied that forgiveness which, when they had been turned from their error, was extended to them? But
in refusing such pardon, you prove yourselves wholly ignorant of the word of God. For read what Paul
has recorded concerning Peter,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4540_1930087">799</A></SUP> and what
Cyprian has expressed as his view on the ground of that statement, and do not blame the compassion of
the Church, which does not scatter the members of Christ when they are gathered together, but labours
to gather His scattered members into one. It is true that those who then stood most resolute, and
were able to understand the treacherous phrases used by the heretics, were few in number when
compared with the rest; but some of them it is to be remembered were then bravely enduring sentence
of banishment, and others were hiding themselves for safety in all parts of the world. And thus the
Church, which is increasing throughout all nations, has been preserved as the Lord's wheat, and shall
be preserved unto the end, yea, until all nations, even the barbarous tribes, are within its embrace.
For it is the Church which the Son of man has sown as good seed, and of which He has foretold that it
should grow among the tares until the harvest. For the field is the world, and the harvest is the end
of time.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4541_1931133">800</A></SUP> </P>

<P>32. Hilary, therefore, either was rebuking not the wheat, but the tares, in those ten provinces of
Asia, or was addressing himself to the wheat, because it was endangered through some unfaithfulness,
and spoke as one who thought that the rebuke would be useful in proportion to the vehemence with
which it was given. For the canonical Scriptures contain examples of the same manner of rebuke in
which what is intended for some is spoken as if it applied to all. Thus the apostle, when he says to
the Corinthians, "How say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4543_1931741">801</A></SUP> proves clearly that all of them were not such;
but he bears witness that those who were such were not outside of their communion, but among them.
And shortly after, lest those who were of a different opinion should be led astray by them, he gave
this warning: "Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. Awake to righteousness, and
sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4544_1932189">802</A></SUP> But when he says, "Whereas there is among you
envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4545_1932334">803</A></SUP> he speaks as if it applied to all, and you see
how grave a charge he makes. Wherefore, if it were not that we read in the same epistle, "I thank my
God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; that in
everything ye are enriched by Him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; even as the testimony of
Christ was confirmed in you: so that ye come behind in no gift,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4546_1932761">804</A></SUP> we would think that all the Corinthians had been
carnal and natural, not perceiving the things of the spirit of God,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4547_1932897">805</A></SUP> fond of strife, and full of envy, and "walking
as men." In like manner it is said, on the one hand, "the whole world lieth in wickedness,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4548_1933058">806</A></SUP> because of the tares which are throughout the
.whole world; and, on the other hand, Christ "is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours
only, but also for the sins of the whole world,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4549_1933270">807</A></SUP> because of the wheat which is throughout the
whole world.</P>

<P>33. The love of many, however, waxes cold because of offences, which abound increasingly the more
that, within the communion of the sacraments of Christ, there are gathered to the glory of His name
even those who are wicked, and who persist in the obstinacy of error; whose separation, however, as
chaff from the wheat, is to be effected only in the final purging of the Lord's
threshing-floor.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4551_1933743">808</A></SUP> These do not destroy
those who are the Lord's wheat-few, indeed, when compared with the others, but in themselves a great
multitude; they do not destroy the elect of God, who are to be gathered at the end of the world from
the four winds, from the one end of heaven to the other.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4552_1934045">809</A></SUP> For it is from the elect that the cry comes,
"Help, Lord! for the godly man ceaseth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4553_1934208">810</A></SUP> and it is of them that the Lord saith, "He that
shall endure to the end (when iniquity shall abound), the same shall be saved."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4554_1934355">811</A></SUP> Moreover, that the psalm quoted is the language
not of one man, but of many, is shown by the following context: "Thou shalt keep us, O Lord; Thou
shalt preserve us from this generation for ever."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4555_1934578">812</A></SUP> On account of this abounding iniquity which the
Lord foretold, it is said in another place: "When the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the
earth?" This doubt expressed by Him who knoweth all things prefigured the doubts which in Him we
entertain, when the Church, being often disappointed in many from whom much was expected, but who
have proved very different from what they were supposed to be, is so alarmed in regard to her own
members, that she is slow to believe good of any one. Nevertheless it would be wrong to cherish doubt
that those whose faith He shall find on the earth are growing along with the tares throughout the
whole field.</P>

<P>34. Therefore it is the same Church also which within the Lord's net is swimming along with the
bad fishes, but is in heart and in life separated from them, and departs from them, that she may be
presented to her Lord a "glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4557_1935517">813</A></SUP> But the actual visible separation she looks for
only on the sea-shore, <I>i.e.</I> at the end of the world,-meanwhile correcting as many as she can,
and bearing with those whom she cannot correct; but she does not abandon the unity of the good
because of the wickedness of those whom she finds incorrigible. </P>

<P>Chap. X.</P>

<P>35. Wherefore, my brother, refrain from gathering together against divine testimonies so many, so
perspicuous, and so unchallenged, the calumnies which may be found in the writings of bishops either
of our communion, as Hilary, or of the undivided Church itself in the age preceding the schism of
Donatus, as Cyprian or Agrippinus;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4560_1936178">814</A></SUP>
because, in the first place, this class of writings must be, so far as authority is concerned,
distinguished from the canon of Scripture. For they are not read by us as if a testimony brought
forward from them was such that it would be unlawful to hold any different opinion, for it may be
that the opinions which they held were different from those to which truth demands our assent. For we
are amongst those who do not reject what has been taught us even by an apostle: "If in anything ye be
otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you; nevertheless, whereto we have already
attained, let us walk by the same rule,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4561_1936870">815</A></SUP>
-in that way, namely, which Christ is; of which way the Psalmist thus speaks: "God be merciful unto
us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us: that Thy way may be known upon earth, Thy
saving health among all nations."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4562_1937127">816</A></SUP> </P>

<P>36. In the next place, if you are charmed by the authority of that bishop and illustrious martyr
St. Cyprian, which we indeed regard, as I have said, as quite distinct from the authority of
canonical Scripture, why are you not charmed by such things in him as these: that he maintained with
loyalty, and defended in debate, the unity of the Church in the world and in all nations; that he
censured, as full of self-sufficiency and pride, those who wished to separate themselves as righteous
from the Church, holding them up to ridicule for assuming to themselves that which the Lord did not
concede even to apostles,-namely, the gathering of the tares before the harvest,-and for attempting
to separate the chaff from the wheat, as if to them had been assigned the charge of removing the
chaff and cleansing the threshing-floor; that he proved that no man can be stained with guilt by the
sins of others, thus sweeping away the only ground alleged by the authors of schism for their,
separation; that in the very matter in regard to which he was of a different opinion from his
colleagues, he did not decree that those who thought otherwise than he did should be condemned or
excommunicated; that even in his letter to Jubaianus<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4564_1938380">817</A></SUP> (which was read for the first time in the
Council,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4565_1938487">818</A></SUP> the authority of which you are
wont to plead in defence of the practice of rebaptizing), although he admits that in time past
persons who had been baptized in other communions had been received into the Church without being a
second time baptized, on which ground they were regarded by him as having had no baptism,
nevertheless he considers the use and benefit of peace within the Church to be so great, that for its
sake he holds that these persons (though in his judgment unbaptized) should 'not be excluded from
office in the Church?</P>

<P>37. And by this you will very readily perceive (for I know the acuteness of your mind) that your
cause is completely subverted and annihilated. For if, as you suppose, the Church which had been
spread abroad throughout the world perished through her admitting sinners to partake in her
sacraments (and this is the ground alleged for your separation), it had wholly perished long
before,-at the time, namely, when, as Cyprian says, men were admitted into it without baptism,-and
thus Cyprian himself had no Church within which to be born; and if so, how. much more must this have
been the case with one who, like Donatus, the author of your schism, and the father of your sect,
belonged to a later age! But if at that time, although persons were being admitted into the Church
without baptism, the Church nevertheless remained in being, so as to give birth to Cyprian and
afterwards to Donatus, it is manifest that the righteous are not defiled by the sins of other men
when they participate with them in the sacraments. And thus you have no excuse by which you can wash
away the guilt of the schism whereby you have gone forth from the unity of the Church; and in you is
fulfilled that saying of Holy Writ: "There is a generation that esteem themselves right, and have not
cleansed themselves from the guilt of their going forth."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4567_1940390">819</A></SUP> </P>

<P>38. The man who, out of regard to the sameness of the sacraments, does not presume to insist on
the second administration of baptism even to heretics, is not, by thus avoiding Cyprian's error,
placed on a level with Cyprian in merit, any more than the man who does not insist upon the Gentiles
conforming to Jewish ceremonies is thereby placed on a level in merit with the Apostle Peter. In
Peter's case, however, the record not only of his halting, but also of his correction, is contained
in the canonical Scriptures; whereas the statement that Cyprian entertained opinions at variance with
those approved by the constitution and practice of the Church is found, not in canonical Scripture,
but in his own writings, and in those of a Council; and although it is not found in the same records
that he corrected that opinion, it is nevertheless by no means an unreasonable supposition that he
did correct it, and that this fact may perhaps have been suppressed by those who were too much
pleased with the error into which he fell, and were unwilling to lose the patronage of so great a
name. At the same time, there are not wanting some who maintain that Cyprian never held the view
ascribed to him, but that this was an unwarrantable forgery passed off by liars under his name. For
it was impossible for the integrity and authenticity of the writings of any one bishop, however
illustrious, to be secured and preserved as the canonical Scriptures are through translation into so
many languages, and through the regular and continuous manner in which the Church has used them in
public worship. Even in the face of this, some have been found forging many things under the names of
the apostles. It is true, indeed, that they made such attempts in vain, because the text of canonical
Scripture was so well attested, and so generally used and known; but this effort of an unholy
boldness, which has not forborne to assail writings which are defended by the strength of such
notoriety, has proved what it is capable of essaying against writings which are not established upon
canonical authority.</P>

<P>39. We, however, do not deny that Cyprian held the views ascribed to him: first, because his style
has a certain peculiarity of expression by which it may be recognised; and secondly, because in this
case our cause rather than yours is proved victorious, and the pretext alleged for your
schism-namely, that you might not be defiled by the sins of other men-is in the most simple manner
exploded; since it is manifest from the letters of Cyprian that participation in the sacraments was
allowed to sinful men, when those who, in your judgment (and as you will have it, in his judgment
also), were unbaptized were as such admitted to the Church, and that nevertheless the Church did not
perish, but remained in the dignity belonging to her nature as the Lord's wheat scattered throughout
the world. And, therefore, if in your consternation you thus betake yourselves to Cyprian's authority
as to a harbour of refuge, you see the rock against which your error dashes itself in this course;
if, on the other hand, you do not venture to flee thither, you are wrecked without any struggle for
escape.</P>

<P>40. Moreover, Cyprian either did not hold at all the opinions which you ascribe to him, or did
subsequently correct his mistake by the rule of truth, or covered this blemish, as we may call it,
upon his otherwise spotless mind by the abundance of his love, in his most amply defending the unity
of the Church growing throughout the whole world, and in his most stedfastly holding the bond of
peace; for it is written, "Charity [love] covereth a multitude of sins."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4571_1944147">820</A></SUP> To thiswas also added, that in him, as a most
fruitful. branch, the Father removed by the pruningknife of suffering whatever may have remained in
him requiring correction: "For every branch in me," saith the Lord, "that beareth fruit He purgeth,
that it may bring forth more fruit."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4572_1944451">821</A></SUP> And
whence this care of him, if not because, continuing as a branch in the far-spreading vine, he did not
forsake the root of unity? "For though he gave his body to be burned, if he had not charity, it would
profit him nothing."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4573_1944699">822</A></SUP> </P>

<P>41. Attend now a little while to the letters of Cyprian, that you may see how he proves the man to
be inexcusable who desires ostensibly on the ground of his own righteousness to withdraw himself from
the unity of the Church (which God promised and has fulfilled in all nations), and that you may more
clearly apprehend the truth of the text quoted by me shortly before: "There is a generation that
esteem themselves righteous, and have not cleansed themselves from the guilt of their going forth."
In a letter which he wrote to Antonianus<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4575_1945262">823</A></SUP>
he discusses a matter very closely akin to that which we are now debating; but it is better for us to
give his very words: "Some of our predecessors," he says, "in the episcopal office in this province
were of opinion that the peace of the Church should not be given to fornicators, and finally closed
the door of repentance against those who had been guilty of adultery. They did not, however, withdraw
themselves from fellowship with their colleagues in the episcopate; nor did they rend asunder the
unity of the Catholic Church, by such harshness and obstinate perseverance in their censure as to
separate themselves from the Church because others granted while they themselves refused to
adulterers the peace of the Church. The bond of concord remaining unbroken, and the sacrament of the
Church continuing undivided, each bishop arranges and orders his own conduct as one who shall give
account of his procedure to his Lord." What say you to that, brother Vincentius? Surely you must see
that this great man, this peace-loving bishop and dauntless martyr, made nothing more earnestly his
care than to prevent the sundering of the bond of unity. You see him travailing in birth for the
souls of men, not only that they might, when conceived, be born in Christ, but also that, when born,
they might not perish through their being shaken out of their mother's bosom.</P>

<P>42. Now give attention, I pray you, further to this thing which he has mentioned in protesting
against impious schismatics. If those who granted peace to adulterers, who repented of their sin,
shared the guilt of adulterers, were those who did not so act defiled by fellowship with them as
colleagues in office? If, again, it was a right thing, as truth asserts and the Church maintains,
that peace should be given to adulterers who repented of their sin, those who utterly closed against
adulterers the door of reconciliation through repentance were unquestionably guilty of impiety in
refusing healing to the members of Christ, in taking away the keys of the Church from those who
knocked for admission, and in opposing with heartless cruelty God's most compassionate forbearance,
which permitted them to live in order that, repenting, they might be healed by the sacrifice of a
contrite spirit and broken heart. Nevertheless this their heartless error an.d impiety did not defile
the others, compassionate and peace-loving men, when these shared with them in the Christian
sacraments, and tolerated them within the net of unity, until the time when, brought to the shore,
they should be separated from each other; or if this error and impiety of others did defile them,
then the Church was already at that time destroyed, and there was no Church to give Cyprian birth.
But if, as is beyond question, the Church continued in existence, it is also beyond question that no
man in the unity of Christ can be stained by the guilt of the sins of other men if he be not
consenting to the deeds of the wicked, and thus defiled by actual participation in their crimes, but
only, for the sake of the fellowship of the good, tolerating the wicked, as the chaff which lies
until the final purging of the Lord's threshing-floor. These things being so, where is the pretext
for your schism? Are ye not an "evil generation, esteeming yourselves righteous, yet not washed from
the guilt of your going forth" [from the Church]?</P>

<P>43. If, now, I were disposed to quote anything against you from the writings of Tychonius, a man
of your communion, who has written rather in defence of the Church and against you than the reverse,
in vain disowning the communion of African Christians as traditors (by which one thing Parmenianus
silences him), what else can you say in reply than what Tychonius himself said of you as I have
shortly before reminded you: "That which is according to our will is holy "?<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4578_1949181">824</A></SUP> For this Tychonius-a man, as I have said, of
your communion-writes that a Council was held at Carthage<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4579_1949299">825</A></SUP> by two hundred and seventy of your bishops; in
which Council, after seventy-five days of deliberation, all past decisions on the matter being set
aside, a carefully revised resolution was published, to the effect. that to those who were guilty of
a heinous crime as traditors, the privilege of communion should be granted as to blameless persons,
if they refused to be baptized. He says further, that Deuterius of Macriana, a bishop of your party,
added to the Church a whole crowd of traditors, without making any distinction between them and
others, making the unity of the Church open to these traditors, in accordance with the decree of the
Council held by these two hundred and seventy of your bishops, and that after that transaction
Donatus continued unbroken his communion with the said Deuterius, and not only with him, but also
with all the Mauritanian bishops for forty years, who, according to the statement of Tychonius,
admitted the traditors to communion without insisting on their being rebaptized, up to the time of
the persecution made by Macarius.</P>

<P>44. You will say, "What has that Tychonius to do with me?" It is true that Tychonius is the man
whom Parmenianus checked by his reply, and effectually warned not to write such things; but he did
not refute the statements themselves, but, as I have said above, silenced him by this one thing, that
while saying such things concerning the Church which is diffused throughout the world, and while
admitting that the faults of other men within its unity cannot defile one who is innocent, he
nevertheless withdrew himself from the contagion of communion with African Christians because of
their being traditors, and was an adherent of the party of Donatus. Parmenianus, indeed, might have
said that Tychonius had in all these things spoken falsely; but, as Tychonius himself observes, many
were still living at that time by whom these things might be proved to be most unquestionably true
and generally known.</P>

<P>45. Of these things, however, I say no more: maintain, if you choose, that Tychonius spoke
falsely; I bring you back to Cyprian, the authority which you yourself have quoted. If, according to
his writings, every one in the unity of the Church is defiled by the sins of other members, then the
Church had utterly perished before Cyprian's time, and all possibility of Cyprian's own existence (as
a member of the Church) is taken away. If, however, the very thought of this is impiety, axed it be
beyond question that the Church continued in being, it follows that no one is defiled by the guilt of
the sins of other men within the Catholic unity; and in vain do you, "an evil generation," maintain
that you are righteous, when you are "not washed from the guilt of your going forth."</P>

<P>Chap. XI.</P>

<P>46. You will say, "Why then do you seek us? Why do you receive those whom you call heretics?" Mark
how simple and short is my reply. We seek you because you are lost, that we may rejoice over you when
found, as over you while lost we grieved. Again we call you heretics; but the name applies to you
only up to the time of your being turned to the peace of the Catholic Church, and extricated from the
errors by which you have been ensnared. For when you pass over to us, you entirely abandon the
position you formerly occupied, so that, as heretics no longer, you pass over to us. You will say,
"Then baptize me." I would, if you were not already baptized, or if you had received the baptism of
Donatus, or of Rogatus only, and not of Christ. It is not the Christian sacraments, but the crime of
schism, which makes you a heretic. The evil which has proceeded from yourself is not a reason for our
denying the good that is permanent in you, but which you possess to your own harm if you have it not
in that Church from which proceeds its power to do good. For from the Catholic Church are all the
sacraments of the Lord, which you hold and administer in the same way as they were held and
administered even before you went forth from her. The fact, however, that you are no longer in that
Church from which proceeded the sacraments which you have, does not make it the less true that you
still have them. We therefore do not change in you that wherein you are at one with ourselves, for in
many things you are at one with us; and of such it is said, "For in many things they were with
me:"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4584_1953712">826</A></SUP> but we correct those things in which
you are not with us, and we wish you to receive those things which you have not where you now are.
You are at one with us in baptism, in creed, and in the other sacraments of the Lord. But in the
spirit of unity and bond of peace, in a word, in the Catholic Church itself, you are not with us. If
you receive these things, the others which you already have will then not begin to be yours, but
begin to be of use to you. We do not therefore, as you think, receive your men of your party as still
belonging to you, but in the act of receiving them we incorporate with ourselves those who forsake
you that they may be received by us; and in order that they may belong to us, their first step is to
renounce their connection with you. Nor do we compel into union with us those who industriously serve
an error which we abhor; but our reason for wishing those men to be united to us is, that they may no
longer be worthy of our abhorrence.</P>

<P>47. But you will say, "The Apostle Paul baptized after John."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4586_1954777">827</A></SUP> Did he then baptize after a heretic? If you do
presume to call that friend of the Bridegroom a heretic, and to say that he was not in the unity of
the Church, I beg that you will put this in writing. But if you believe that it would be the height
of folly to think or to say so, it remains for your own wisdom to resolve the question why the
Apostle Paul baptized after John. For if he baptized after one who was his equal, you ought all to
baptize after one another. If after one who was greater than himself, you ought to baptize after
Rogatus; if after one who was less than himself, Rogatus ought to have baptized after you those whom
you, as a presbyter, had baptized. If, however, the baptism which is now administered is in all cases
of equal value to those who receive it, however unequal in merit the persons may be by whom it is
administered, because it is the baptism of Christ, not of those who administer the right, I think you
must already perceive that Paul administered the baptism of Christ to certain persons because they
had received the baptism of John only, and not of Christ; for it is expressly called the baptism of
John, as the Divine Scripture bears witness in many passages, and as the Lord Himself calls it,
saying: "The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4587_1956103">828</A></SUP> But the baptism which Peter administered was the
baptism, not of Peter, but of Christ; that which Paul administered was the baptism, not of Paul, but
of Christ; that which .was administered by those who, in the apostle's time, preached Christ not
sincerely, but of contention,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4588_1956402">829</A></SUP> was not
their own, but the baptism of Christ; and that which was administered by those who, in Cyprian's
time, either by artful dishonesty obtained their possessions, or by usury, at exorbitant interest,
increased them, was not their own baptism, but the baptism of Christ. And because it was of Christ,
therefore, although there was very great disparity in the persons by whom it was administered, it was
equally useful to those by whom it was received. For if the excellency of the person by whom one is
baptized, it was wrong in the apostle to give thanks that he had baptized none of the Corinthians,
but Crispus, and Gaius, and the house of Stephanas;<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4589_1957083">830</A></SUP> for the baptism of the converts in Corinth, if
administered by himself, would have been so much more excellent as Paul himself was more excellent
than other men. Lastly, when he says, "I have planted, and Apollos watered,"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4590_1957327">831</A></SUP> he seems to intimate that he had preached the
gospel, and that Apollos had baptized. Is Apollos better than John? Why then did he, who baptized
after John, not baptize after Apollos? Surely because, in the one case, the baptism, by whomsoever
administered, was the baptism of Christ; and in the other case, by whomsoever administered, it was,
although preparing the way for Christ, only the baptism of John.</P>

<P>48. It seems to you an odious thing to say that baptism was given to some after John had baptized
them, and yet that baptism is not to be given to men after heretics have baptized them; but it may be
said with equal justice to be an odious thing that baptism was given to some after John had baptized
them, and yet that baptism is not to be given to men after intemperate persons have baptized them. I
name this sin of intemperance. rather than others, because those in whom it reigns are not able to
hide it: and yet what man, even though he be blind, does not know how many addicted to this vice are
to, be found everywhere? And yet among the works of the flesh, of which it is said that they who do
them shall not inherit the kingdom of God, the apostle places this in an enumeration in which
heresies also are specified: "Now the works of the flesh," he says, "are manifest, which are these:
adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such
like; of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4592_1958990">832</A></SUP> Baptism, therefore, although it was administered
after John, is not administered after a heretic, on the very same principle according to which,
though administered after John; it is not administered after an intemperate man: for both heresies
and drunkenness are among the works which exclude those who do them from inheriting the kingdom of
God. Does it not seem to you as if it were a thing intolerably unseemly, that although baptism was
repeated after it had been administered by him who, not even moderately drinking wine, but wholly
refraining from its use, prepared the way for the kingdom of God, and yet that it should not be
repeated after being administered by an intemperate man, who shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
What can be said in answer to this, but that the one was the baptism of John, after which the apostle
administered the baptism of Christ; and that the other, administered by an intemperate man, was the
baptism of Christ? Between John Baptist and an intemperate man there is a great difference, as of
opposites; between the baptism of Christ and the baptism of John there is no contrariety, but a great
difference. Between the apostle and an intemperate man there is a great difference; but there is none
between the baptism of Christ administered by an apostle, and the baptism of Christ administered by
anintemperate man. In like manner, between John and a heretic there is a great difference, as of
opposites; and between the baptism of John and the baptism of Christ which a heretic administers
there is no contrariety, but there is a great difference. But between the baptism. of Christ which an
apostle administers, and the baptism of Christ which a heretic administers, there is no difference.
For the form of the sacrament is acknowledged to be the same even when there is a great difference in
point of worth between the men by whom it is administered.</P>

<P>49. But pardon me, for I have made a mistake in wishing to convince you by arguing from the case
of an intemperate man administering baptism; for I had forgotten that I am dealing with a Rogatist,
not with one bearing the wider name of Donatist. For among your colleagues who are so few, and in the
whole number of your clergy, perhaps you cannot find one addicted to this vice. For you are persons
who hold that the name Catholic is given to the faith not because communion of those who hold it
embraces the whole world, but because they observe the whole of the Divine precepts and the whole of
the sacraments; you are the persons in whom alone the Son of man when He cometh shall find faith,
when on the earth He shall find no faith, forasmuch as you are not earth and on the earth, but
heavenly and dwelling in heaven! Do you not fear, or do you not observe that "God resisteth the
proud, but giveth grace to the humble"?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4594_1961833">833</A></SUP>
Does not that very passage in the Gospel startle you, in which the Lord saith, "When the Son of man
cometh, shall He find faith in the earth?"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4595_1961995">834</A></SUP> Immediately thereafter, as if foreseeing that
some would proudly arrogate to themselves the possession of this faith, He spake to some who trusted
in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others, the parable of the two men who went up
to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The words which follow I leave
for yourself to consider and to answer, Nevertheless examine more minutely your small sect, to see
whether not so much as one who administers baptism is an intemperate man. For so widespread is the
havoc wrought among souls by this plague, that I am greatly surprised if it has not reached even your
infinitesimal flock, although it is your boast that already, before the coming of Christ, the one
good Shepherd, you have separated between the sheep and the goats.</P>

<P>Chap. XII.50. Listen to the testimony which through me is addressed to you by those who are the
Lord's wheat, suffering meanwhile until the final winnowing,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4597_1962985">835</A></SUP> among the chaff in the Lord's threshing-floor,
<I>i.e.</I> throughout the whole world, because "God hath called the earth from the rising of the sun
unto the going down thereof,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4598_1963180">836</A></SUP> and
throughout the same wide field the "children praise Him."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4599_1963259">837</A></SUP> We disapprove of every one who, taking advantage
of this imperial edict, persecutes you, not with loving concern for your correction, but with the
malice of an enemy. Moreover, although, since every earthly possession can be rightly retained only
on the ground either of divine right, according to which all things belong to the righteous, or of
human right, which is in the jurisdiction of the kings of the earth, you are mistaken in calling
those things yours which you do not possess as righteous persons, and which you have forfeited by the
laws of earthly sovereigns, and plead in vain, "We have laboured to gather them," seeing that you may
read what is written, "The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just; "<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4600_1964004">838</A></SUP> nevertheless we disapprove of any one who,
availing himself of this law which the kings of the earth, doing homage to Christ, have published in
order to correct your impiety, covetously seeks to possess himself of your property. Also we
disapprove of any one who, on the ground not of justice, but of avarice, seizes and retains the
provision pertaining to the poor, or the chapels<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4601_1964409">839</A></SUP> in which you meet for worship, which you once
occupied in the name of the Church, and which are by all means the rightful property only of that
Church which is the true Church of Christ. We disapprove of any one who receives a person that has
been expelled by you for some disgraceful action or crime, on the same terms on which those are
received who have lived among you chargeable with no other crime beyond the error through which you
are separated from us. But these are things which you cannot easily prove; and although you can prove
them,= we bear with some whom we are unable to correct or even to punish; and we do not quit the
Lord's threshing-floor because of the chaff which is there, nor break the Lord's net because of bad
fishes enclosed therein, nor desert the Lord's flock because of goats which are to be in the end
separated from it, nor go forth from the Lord's house because in it there are vessels destined to
dishonour.</P>

<P>Chap. XIII.</P>

<P>51. But, my brother, if you forbear seeking the empty honour which comes from men, and despise the
reproach of fools, who will be ready to say, "Why do you now destroy what you once laboured to build
up?" it seems to me to be beyond doubt that you will now pass over to the Church which I perceive
that you acknowledge to be the true Church: the proofs of which sentiment on your part I find at
hand. For in the beginning of your letter which I am now answering you have these words: "I knew you,
my excellent friend, as a man devoted to peace and uprightness, when you were still far removed from
the Christian faith, and were in these earlier days occupied with literary pursuits; but since your
conversion at a more recent time to the Christian faith, you give your time and labour, as I am
informed by the statements of many, persons, to theological controversies."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4604_1966251">840</A></SUP> These words are undoubtedly your own, if you
were the person who sent me that letter. Seeing, therefore, that you confess that I have been
converted to the Christian faith, although I have not been converted to the sect of the Donatists or
of the Rogatists, you unquestionably uphold the truth that beyond the pale of Rogatists and Donatists
the Christian faith exists. This faith therefore is, as we say, spread abroad throughout all nations,
which are according to God's testimony blessed in the seed of Abraham.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4605_1966800">841</A></SUP> Why therefore do you still hesitate to adopt
what you perceive to be true, unless it be that you are humbled because at some former time you did
not perceive what you now see, or maintained some different view, and so, while ashamed to correct an
error, are not ashamed (where shame would be much more reasonable) of remaining wilfully in
error?</P>

<P>52. Such conduct the Scripture has not passed over in silence; for we read, "There is a shame
which bringeth sin, and there is a shame which is graceful and glorious."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4607_1967335">842</A></SUP> Shame brings sin, when through its influence any
one forbears from changing a wicked opinion, lest he be supposed to be fickle, or be held as by his
own judgment convicted of having been long in error: such persons descend into the pit alive, that
is, conscious of their perdition; whose future doom the death of Dathan and Abiram and Korah,
swallowed up by the opening earth, long ago prefigured.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4608_1967756">843</A></SUP> But shame is graceful and glorious when one
blushes for his own sin, and by repentance is changed to something better, which you are reluctant to
do because overpowered by that false and fatal shame, fearing lest by men who know not whereof they
affirm, that sentence of the apostle may be quoted against you: "If I build again the things which I
destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4609_1968169">844</A></SUP>
If, however, this sentence admitted of application to those who, after being corrected, preach the
truth which in their perversity they opposed, it might have been said at first against Paul himself,
in regard to whom the churches of Christ glorified God when they heard that he now "preached the
faith which once he destroyed."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4610_1968517">845</A></SUP> </P>

<P>53. Do not, however, imagine that one can pass from error to truth, or from any sin, be it great
or small, to the correction of his sin, without giving some proof of his repentance. It is, however,
an error of intolerable impertinence for men to blame the Church, which is proved by so many Divine
testimonies to be the Church of Christ, for dealing in one way with those who forsake her, receiving
them back on condition of correcting this fault by some acknowledgment of their repentance, and in
another way with those who never were within her pale, and are receiving welcome to her peace for the
first time; her method being to humble the former more fully, and to receive the latter upon easier
terms, cherishing affection for both, and ministering with a mother's love to the health of both.</P>

<P>You have here perhaps a longer letter than, you desired. It would have been much shorter if in my
reply I had been thinking of you alone; but as it is, even though it should be of no use to yourself,
I do not think that it can fail to be of use to those who shall take pains to read it in the fear of
God, and without respect of persons. Amen.</P>

<P>A letter to Augustin from Paulinus and Therasia, the substance of which is sufficiently stated in

present life, the nature of the bodies of the blessed in the life to come, and the functions of the
members of the body after the resurrection.</P>

  <UL><P><I>To Brother Paulinus and Sister Therasia, Most Beloved and Sincere Saints Worthy of
Affection and Veneration, Fellow-Disciples with Himself Under the Lord Jesus as Master Augustin Sends
Greeting in the Lord.</I></P>

</UL><P>1. When brethren most closely united to us, towards whom along with us you are accustomed
both to cherish and to express sentiments of regard which we all cordially reciprocate, have frequent
occasions of visiting you, this benefit is one by which we are comforted under evil rather than made
to rejoice in increase of good. For we strive to the utmost of our power to avoid the causes and
emergencies which necessitate their journeys, and yet,-I know not how, unless it be as just
retribution,-they cannot be dispensed with: but when they return to us and see us, that word of
Scripture is fulfilled in our experience: "In the multitude of my thoughts within me, Thy comforts
delight my soul."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4622_1970961">846</A></SUP> Accordingly, when you
learn from our brother Possidius himself how sad is the occasion which has compelled him to go to
Italy,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4623_1971109">847</A></SUP> you will know how true the remarks
I have made are in regard to the joy which he has in meeting you; and yet, if any of us should cross
the sea for the one purpose of enjoying a meeting with you, what more cogent or worthy reason could
be found? This, however, would not be compatible with those obligations by which we are bound to
minister to those who are languid through infirmity, and not to withdraw our bodily presence from
them, unless their malady, assuming dangerous form, makes such departure imperative. Whether in these
things we are receiving chastening or judgment I know not; but this I know, that He is not dealing
with us according to our I sins, nor requiting us according to our iniquities,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4624_1971966">848</A></SUP> who mingles so great comfort with our
tribulation, and who, by remedies which fill us with wonder, secures that we shall not love the
world, and shall not by it be made to fall away.</P>

<P>2. I asked in a former letter your opinion as to the nature of the future life of the saints; I
but you have said in your reply that we have still much to study concerning our condition in this
present life, and you do well, except in this, that you have expressed your desire to learn from me
that of which you are either equally ignorant or equally well-informed with myself, or rather, of
which you know much more perhaps than I do; for you have said with perfect truth, that before we meet
the dissolution of this mortal body, we must die, in a gospel sense, by a voluntary departure,
withdrawing ourselves, not by death, but by deliberate resolution, from the life of this world. This
course is a simple one, and is beset with no waves of uncertainty; because we are of opinion that we
ought so to live in this mortal life that we may be in some measure fitted for immortality. The whole
question, however, which, when discussed and investigated, perplexes men like myself, is this-how we
ought to live among or for the welfare of those who have not yet learned to live by dying, not in the
dissolution of the body, but by turning themselves with a certain mental resolution away from the
attractions of mere natural things. For in most cases, it seems to us that unless we in some small
degree conform to them in regard to those very things from which we desire to see them delivered, we
shall not succeed in doing them any good. And when we do thus conform, a pleasure in such things
steals upon ourselves, so that often we are pleased to speak and to listen to frivolous things, and
not only to smile at them, but even to be completely overcome with laughter: thus burdening our souls
with feelings which cleave to the dust, or even to the mire of this world, we experience greater
difficulty and reluctance in raising ourselves to God that by dying a gospel-death we may live a
gospel-life. And whensoever this state of mind is reached, immediately thereupon will follow the
commendation, "Well done! well done!" not from men, for no man perceives in another the mental act by
which divine things are apprehended, but in a certain inward silence there sounds I know not whence,
"Well done! well done!" Because of this kind of temptation, the great apostle confesses that he was
buffeted by the angel.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4626_1974480">849</A></SUP> Behold whence it
comes that our whole life on earth is a temptation; for man is tempted even in that tiring in which
he is being conformed so far as he can be to the likeness of the heavenly life.</P>

<P>3. What shall I say as to the infliction or remission of punishment, in cases in which we have no
other desire than to forward the spiritual welfare of those in regard to whom we judge that they
ought or ought not to be punished? Also, if we consider not only the nature and magnitude of faults,
but also what each may be able or unable to bear according to his strength of mind, how deep and dark
a question it is to adjust the amount of punishment so as to prevent the person who receives it not
only from getting no good, but also from suffering loss thereby! Besides, I know not whether a
greater number have been improved or made worse when alarmed under threats of such punishment! at the
hands of men as is an object of fear. What, then, is the path of duty, seeing that it often happens
that if you inflict punishment on one he goes to destruction; whereas, if you leave him unpunished,
another is destroyed? I confess that I make mistakes daily in regard to this, and that I know not
when and how to observe the rule of Scripture: "Them that sin rebuke before all, that others may
fear;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4628_1975795">850</A></SUP> and that other rule, "Tell him his
fault between thee and him alone;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4629_1975883">851</A></SUP> and
the rule, "Judge nothing before the time;"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4630_1975954">852</A></SUP> "Judge not, that ye be not judged"<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4631_1976010">853</A></SUP> (in which command the Lord has not added the
words, "before the time"); and this saying of Scripture, "Who art thou that judgest another man's
servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth: yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to
make him stand;"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4632_1976289">854</A></SUP> by which words he makes
it plain that he is speaking of those who are within the Church; yet, on the other hand, he commands
them to be judged when he says, "What have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye
judge them that are within? therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4633_1976622">855</A></SUP> But when this is necessary, how much care and
fear is occasioned by the question to what extent it should be done, lest that happen which, in his
second epistle to them, the apostle is found admonishing these persons to beware of in that very
example, saying, "lest, perhaps, such an one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow;" adding, in
order to prevent men from thinking this a thing not calling for anxious care, "lest Satan should get
an advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4634_1977153">856</A></SUP> What trembling we feel in all these things, my
brother Paulinus, O holy man of God! what trembling, what darkness! May we not think that with
reference to these things it was said, "Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at
rest. Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness." And yet even in the wilderness
perchance he still experienced it; for he adds, "I waited for Him who should deliver me from weakness
and from tempest."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4635_1977740">857</A></SUP> Truly, therefore, is
the life of man upon the earth a life of temptation.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4636_1977855">858</A></SUP> </P>

<p>    4. Moreover, as to the oracles of God, is it not true that they are lightly touched rather than grasped and handled by us, seeing that in by far the greater part of them we do not already possess opinions definite and ascertained, but are rather inquiring what our opinion ought to be? And this caution, though attended with abundant disquietude, is much better than the rashness of dogmatic assertion. Also, if a man is not carnally minded (which the apostle says is death), will he not be a great cause of offence to those who are still carnally minded, in many parts of Scripture in the exposition of which to say what you believe is most perilous, and to refrain from saying it is most grievous, and to say something else than what you believe is most pernicious ? Nay more, when in the discourses or writings of those who are within the Church we find some things censurable, and do not conceal our disapprobation (supposing such correction to be according to the freedom of brotherly love), how great a sin is committed against us<br>
<br>
403<br>
<br>
when we are suspected of being actuated in this by envy and not by goodwill! and how much do we sin against others, when we in like manner impute to those who find fault with our opinions a desire rather to wound than to correct us: Verily, there arise usually from this cause bitter enmities even between persons bound to each: other by the greatest affection and intimacy, when, "thinking of men above that which is written, any one is puffed up for one against another; "' and while they bite and devour one another, "there is reason to fear lest they be consumed one of another." 2 Therefore, "Oh that I had wings like a dove ! for then would I fly away, and be at rest."3 For whether it be that the dangers by which one is beset seem to him greater than those of which he has no experience, or that my impressions are correct, I cannot help thinking that any amount of weakness and of tempest in the wilderness would be more easily borne than the things which we feel or fear in the busy world.<br>
    5. I therefore greatly approve of your saying that we should make the state in which men stand, or rather the course which they run, in this present life, the theme of our discussion. I add as another reason for our giving this subject the preference, that the finding and following of the course itself must come before our finding and possessing that towards which it leads. When, therefore, I asked your views on this, I acted as if, through holding and observing carefully the right rule of this life, we were already free from disquietude concerning its course, although I feel in so many things, and especially in those which I have mentioned, that I toil in the midst of very great dangers. Nevertheless, forasmuch as the cause of all this ignorance and embarrassment appears to me to be that, in the midst of a great variety of manners and of minds having inclinations and infirmities hidden altogether from our sight, we seek the interest of those who are citizens and subjects, not of Rome which is on earth, but of Jerusalem which is in heaven, it seemed to me more agreeable to converse with you about what we shall be, than about what we now are. For although we do not know the blessings which are to be enjoyed yonder, of one thing at least we are assured, and it is not a small thing, that yonder the evils which we experience here shall have no place.<br>
    6. Wherefore, as to the ordering of this present life in the way which we must follow in order to the 'attainment of eternal life, I know that our carnal appetites must be held in check, only so much concession being made to the gratification of the bodily senses as suffices for the support of this life and the active discharge of its duties, and that all the vexations of this life which come upon us in connection with the truth of God, and the eternal welfare of ourselves or of our neighbours, must be borne with patience and fortitude. I know also that with all the zeal of love we should seek the good of our neighbour, that he may rightly spend the present life so as to obtain life eternal. I know also that we ought to prefer spiritual to carnal, immutable to mutable things, and that all this a man is so much more or less enabled to do, according as he is more or less helped by the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. But I do not know the reason why one or another is more or less helped or not helped by that grace; this only I know, that God does this with perfect justice, and for reasons which to Himself are known as sufficient. In regard, however, to the things which I have mentioned above, as to the way in which we ought to live amongst men, if anything has become known to you through experience or meditation, I beseech you to give me instruction. And if these things perplex you not less than myself, make them the subject of conference with some judicious spiritual physician, whom you may find either where you reside, or in Rome, when you make your annual visit to the city, and thereafter write to me whatever the Lord may reveal to you through his instructions, or to you and him together when engaged in conversation on the subject.<br>
    7. As to the resurrection of the body, and the future offices of its members in the incorruptible and immortal state, since you have, in" return for the questions which I put to you, inquired my views on these matters, listen to 'a brief statement which, if it be not sufficient, may afterwards, with the Lord's help, be amplified by fuller discussion. It is to be held most firmly, as a doctrine in regard to which the testimony of Holy Scripture is true and unmistakable, that these visible and earthly bodies which are now called natural? shall, in the resurrection of the faithful and just, be spiritual bodies. At the same time, I do not,.know how the quality of a spiritual body can be comprehended or stated by us, seeing that it lies beyond the range of our experience. There shall be, assuredly, in such bodies no corruption, and therefore they shall not require the perishable nourishment which is now necessary; yet though unnecessary, it will not be impossible for them at their pleasure to take and actually consume food; otherwise it would not have been taken after His resurrection by the Lord, who has given us such an example of the resurrection of the body, that the apostle argues from it: "If the dead rise not, then is<br>
<br>
404<br>
<br>
not Christ raised."' But He, when He appeared to His disciples, having all His members, and using them according to their functions, also pointed out to them the places where His wounds had been, regarding which I have always supposed that they were the scars, not the wounds themselves, and that they were there, not of necessity, but according to His free exercise of power. He gave at that time the clearest evidence of the ease with which He exercised this power, both by showing Himself in another: form to the two disciples, and by His appearing, not as a spirit, but in His true body, to the disciples in the upper chamber, although the doors were shut?<br>
    8. From this arises the question as to angels, whether they have bodies adapted to their duties and their swift motions from place to place, or are only spirits ? For if we say that they have bodies, we are met by the passage: "He maketh His angels spirits ;"a and if we say that they have not bodies, a still greater difficulty meets us in explaining how, if they are without bodily form, it is written that they appeared to the bodily senses of men, accepted offers of hospitality, permitted their feet to be washed, and used the meat and drink which was provided for them.4 For it seems to involve us in less difficulty, if we suppose that the angels are there called spirits in the same manner as men are called souls, e.g. in the statement that so many souls (not signifying that they had not bodies also) went down with Jacob into Egypt,s than if we suppose that, without bodily form, all these things were done by angels. Again, a certain definite height is named in the Apocalypse as the stature of an angel, in dimensions which could apply only to bodies, proving that that which appeared to the eyes of men is to be explained, not as an illusion, but as resulting from the power which we have spoken of as easily put forth by spiritual bodies. But whether angels have bodies or not, and whether or not any one be able to show how without bodies they could do all these things, it is nevertheless certain, that in that city of the holy in which those of our race who have been redeemed by Christ shall be united for ever to thousands of angels, voices proceeding from organs of speech shall furnish expression to the thoughts of minds in which nothing is hidden; for in that divine fellowship it will not be possible for any thought in one to remain concealed from another, but there shall be complete harmony and oneness of heart in the praise of God, and this shall find utterance not only from the spirit, but through the spiritual body as its instrument; this, at least, is what I believe.<br>
    9. Meanwhile, if you have already found or can learn from other teachers anything more fully agreeing with the truth than this, I am most eagerly longing to be instructed therein by you. Study carefully, if you please, my letter, in regard to which, as you pied in excuse for your very hurried reply the haste of the deacon who brought it to me, I do not make any complaint, but rather remind you of it, in order that what was then omitted in your answer may now be supplied. Look over it again, and observe what I wished to learn from you, both regarding your opinion concerning Christian retirement as a means to the acquisition and discussion of the truths of Christian wisdom, and regarding that retirement in which I supposed that you had found leisure, but in which it is reported to me that you are engrossed with occupation to an incredible extent.<br>
    May you, in whom the holy God has given us great joy and consolation, live mindful of us, and in true felicity. (This sentence is added by another hand.)<br>

                       LETTER XCVI. (A.D. 408.)<br>
<br>
	TO OLYMPIUS, MY LORD GREATLY BELOVED, AND MY SON WORTHY OF HONOUR AND REGARD AS  A MEMBER OF CHRIST, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    1. Whatever your rank may be in connection with the course of this world, I have the greatest confidence in addressing you as my much-loved, true-hearted Christian fellow-servant Olympius. For I know that this name, in your esteem, excels all,other glorious and lofty titles. Reports have indeed reached me that you have obtained some promotion in worldly honour, but no information confirming the truth of the rumour had come to me up to the time when this opportunity of writing to you occurred. Since, however, I know that you have learned from the Lord not to mind high things, but to condescend to those who are lightly esteemed by men, whatever the pinnacle to which you may have been raised, we take for granted, my lord greatly beloved, and son worthy of honour and regard as a member of Christ, that you will still make a letter from me welcome, just as you were wont to do. And as to your worldly prosperity, I do not doubt that you will wisely use it for your eternal gain; so that the greater the influence which you acquire in the commonwealth on this earth, the more will you devote yourself to the interests of the heavenly city to which you owe your birth in Christ, forasmuch as this shall be more abundantly repaid to you in the land of the living,<br>
<br>
405<br>
<br>
and in the true peace which yields sure and endless joys.1<br>
    2. I again commend to your kind consideration the petition of my brother and colleague Boniface, in the hope that what could not be done before may be in your power now. He might perhaps, indeed, legally retain, without any further difficulty, that which his predecessor had acquired, though under another name than his own, and which he had begun to possess in name of the church; but we do not wish, since his predecessor was in debt to the public exchequer, to have this burden upon our conscience. For that act of fraud was none the less truly fraud because perpetrated at the expense of the public revenue. The same Paul (the predecessor of Boniface), when he was made bishop, being about to surrender all his effects because of the accumulated burden of arrears due to the public exchequer, having secured payment of a bond by which a certain sum of money was due to him, bought with it, as if for the church, in the name of a family then very Z powerful, these few fields by the produce of which he might support himself, in order that, in respect to these also, after his old practice, he might escape annoyance at the hands of the collectors of the revenue, although he was paying no tax. Boniface, however, when ordained over the same church, on his death, hesitated to take the fields which he had thus held; and although he might have contented himself with asking from the emperor no more than a remission of the fiscal arrears which his predecessor had incurred on this small property, he preferred to confess without reserve that Paul had bought the property at an auction with money of his own,: at a time when he was bankrupt as a debtor to the public revenue, so that now the Church may, if possible, obtain possession of this, not through the secret fraud of her bishop, but by an open act of the Christian emperor's liberality. And if this be impossible, the servants of God prefer to bear the' hardship of want, rather than obtain the supply of that which they require under reproaches of conscience for dishonourable dealing.<br>
    3. I beg you to condescend to give your support to this petition, because he has resolved not to bring forward the decision in his favour which was formerly obtained, lest it should preclude him from the liberty of making a second application; for the answer then given fell short of what he desired. And now, since you are of the same kindly disposition that you formerly were, but possessed of greater influence, I do not despair of this being easily granted by the Lord's help, in consideration of your claims on the emperor; and if even you were to ask the gift of the property in your own name, and present it to the church of which I have spoken, who would find fault with your request; nay, rather, who would not commend it, as dictated not by personal covetousness, but by Christian piety? May the mercy of the Lord our God shield you, and make you more and more happy in Christ, my lord and son.<br>
<br>
                       LETTER XCVII. (A.D. 408.)<br>
	TO OLYMPIUS, MY EXCELLENT AND JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED LORD, AND MY SON WORTHY OF MUCH HONOUR IN CHRIST, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. Although, when we heard recently of your having obtained merited promotion to the highest rank, we felt persuaded, however uncertain we still were in some degree as to the truth of the report, that towards the Church of which we rejoice to know that you are truly a son, there was no other feeling in your mind than that which you have now made patent to us in your letter, nevertheless, having now read that letter in which you have been pleased of your own accord to send to us, when we were full of backwardness and diffidence, a most gracious exhortation to use our humble efforts in pointing out to you how the Lord, by whose gift you are thus powerful, may from time to time, by means of your pious obedience, bring assistance to His Church, we write to you with the more abundant confidence, my excellent and justly distinguished lord, and my son worthy of much honour in Christ.<br>
    5. Many brethren, indeed, holy men who are my colleagues, have, by reason of the troubles of the church here, gone- I might almost say !as fugitives--to the emperor's most illustrious 'court; and these brethren you may have already seen, or may have received from Rome their letters, in connection with their respective occasions of appeal. I have not had it in my power to consult them before writing; nevertheless, I was unwilling to miss the opportunity of sending a letter by the bearer, my brother and fellow-presbyter, who has been compelled, though in mid-winter, to make the best of his way into those parts, under pressing necessity, in order to save the life of a fellow-citizen. I write, therefore, to salute you, and to charge you by the love which you have in Christ Jesus our Lord, to see that your good work be hastened on with ' the utmost diligence, in order that the enemies of the Church may know that those laws concerning the demolition of idols and the correction of heretics which were sent into Africa<br>
<br>
406<br>
<br>
while Stilicho yet lived, were framed by the desire of our most pious and faithful emperor; for they either cunningly boast, or unwillingly' imagine that this was done without his knowledge, or against his will, and thus they render the minds of the ignorant full of seditious violence, and excite them to dangerous and vehement enmity against us.<br>
    3. I do not doubt that, in submitting this in the way of petition or respectful suggestion to the consideration of your Excellency, I act agreeably to the wishes of all my colleagues throughout Africa; and I think that it is your duty to take measures, as could be easily done, on whatever opportunity may first arise, to make it understood by these vain men (whose salvation we seek, although they resist us), that it was to the care, not of Stilicho, but of the son of Theodosius, that those laws which have been sent into Africa for the defence of the Church of Christ owed their promulgation. On account of these things, then, the presbyter whom I have mentioned already, the bearer of this letter, who is from the district of Milevi, was ordered by his bishop, the venerable Severus, who joins me in cordial salutations to you, whose love we esteem most genuine, to pass through Hippo-regius, where I am; because, when we happened to meet together in time of serious tribulation and distress to the Church, we sought an opportunity of writing to your Highness, but found none. I had indeed already sent one letter in regard to the business of our holy brother and colleague Boniface, bishop of Cataqua; but the heavier calamities destined to cause us greater agitation had not then befallen us, regarding which, and the means whereby something may be done with the best counsel for their prevention or punishment, according to the method of Christ, the bishops who have sailed hence on that errand will be able more conveniently to confer with you, in whose cordial goodwill towards us we rejoice, inasmuch as they are able to report to you something which has been, so far as limited time permitted, the result of careful an{t united consultation. But as to this other matter, namely, that the province be made to know how the mind of our most gracious and religious emperor stands towards the Church, I recommend, nay, I beg, beseech, and implore you, to take care that no time be lost, but that its accomplishment be hastened, even before you see the bishops who have gone from us, so soon as shall be possible for you, in the exercise of your most eminent vigilance on behalf of the members of Christ who are now in circumstances of the utmost danger; for the Lord has provided no small consolation for us under these trials, seeing that it has pleased Him to put much more now than formerly in your power, although we were already filled with joy by the number and the magnitude of your good offices.<br>
    4. We rejoice much in the firm and stedfast faith of some, and these not few in number, who by means of these laws have been converted to the Christian religion, or from schism to Catholic peace, for whose eternal welfare 'we are glad to run the risk of forfeiting temporal welfare. For on this account especially we now have to endure at the hands of men, exceedingly and obdurately perverse, more grievous assaults of enmity, which some of them, along with us, bear most patiently; but we are in very great fear because of their weakness, until they learn, and are enabled by the help of the Lord's most compassionate grace, to despise with more abundant strength of spirit the present world and man's short day. May it please your Highness to deliver the letter of instructions which I have sent to my brethren the bishops when they come, if, as I suppose, they have not yet reached you. For we have such confidence in the unfeigned devotion of your heart, that with the Lord's help we desire to have you not only giving us your assistance, but also participating in our consultations.<br>
<br>
                      LETTER XCVIII. (A.D. 408.)<br>
<br>
	TO BONIFACE, HIS COLLEAGUE IN THE EPISCOPAL OFFICE, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. You ask me to state "whether parents do harm to their baptized infant children, when they attempt to heal them in time of sickness by sacrifices to the false gods of the heathen." Also, "if they do thereby no harm to their children, how can any advantage come to these children at their baptism, through the faith of parents whose departure from the faith does them no harm ?" To which I reply, that in the holy union of the parts of the body of Christ, so great is the virtue of that sacrament, namely, of baptism, which brings salvation, that so soon as he who owed his first birth to others, acting under the impulse of natural instincts, has been made partaker of the second birth by others, acting under the impulse of spiritual desires, he cannot be thenceforward held under the bond of that sin in another to which he does not with his own will consent. "Both the soul of the father is mine," saith the Lord," and the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die;"1 but he does not sin on whose behalf his parents or any other one resort, without his knowledge, to the impiety of worshipping heathen deities. 'That bond of guilt which was to be<br>
<br>
407<br>
<br>
cancelled by the grace of this sacrament he derived from Adam, for this reason, that at the time of Adam's sin he was not yet a soul having a separate life, i.e. another soul regarding which it! could be said, "both the soul of the father is mine, and the soul of the son is mine." Therefore now, when the man has a personal, separate existence, being thereby made distinct from his parents, he is not held responsible for that sin in another which is performed without his consent. In the former case, he derived guilt from another, because, at the time when the guilt which he has derived was incurred, he was one with the person from whom he derived it, and was in him. But one man does not derive guilt from another, when, through the fact that each has a separate life belonging to himself, the word may apply equally to both --" The soul that sinneth, it shall die."<br>
    2. But the possibility of regeneration through the office rendered by the will of another, when the child is presented to receive the sacred rite, is the work exclusively of the Spirit by whom the child thus presented is regenerated. For it is not written, "Except a man be born again by the will of his parents, or by the faith of those presenting the child, or of those administering the ordinance," but, "Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit."' By the water, therefore; which holds forth the sacrament of grace in its outward form, and by the Spirit who bestows the benefit of grace in its inward power, cancelling the bond of guilt, and restoring natural goodness [reconcilians bonum natural], the man deriving his first birth originally from Adam alone, is regenerated in Christ alone. Now the regenerating Spirit is possessed in common both by the parents who present the child, and by the infant that is presented and is born again; wherefore, in virtue of this participation in the same Spirit, the will of those who present the infant is useful to the child. But when the parents sin against the child by presenting him to the false gods of the heathen, and attempting to bring him under impious bonds unto these false gods, there is not such community of souls subsisting between the parents and the child, that the guilt of one party can be common to both alike. For we are not made partakers of guilt along with others through their will, in the same way as we are made partakers of grace along with others through the unity of the Holy Spirit; because the one Holy Spirit can be in two different persons without their knowing in respect to each other that by Him! grace is the common possession of both, but the human spirit cannot so belong to two individuals as to make the blame common to both in a case in which one of the two sins, and the other does not sin. Therefore a child, having once received natural birth through his parents, can be made partaker of the second (or spiritual) birth by the Spirit of God, so that the bond of guilt which he inherited from his parents is cancelled; but he that has once received this second birth by the Spirit of God cannot be i made again partaker of natural birth through his parents, so that the bond once cancelled should again bind him. And thus, when the grace of Christ has been once received, the child does not lose it otherwise than by his own impiety, if, when he becomes older, he turn out so ill. For by that time he will begin to have sins of his own, which cannot be removed by regeneration, but must be healed by other remedial measures.<br>
3. Nevertheless, persons of more advanced fears, whether they be parents bringing their children, or others bringing any little ones, who attempt to place those who have been baptized under obligation to profane worship of heathen gods, are guilty of spiritual homicide. True, they do not actually kill the children's souls, but they go as far towards killing them as is in their power. The warning, "I)o not kill your little ones," may be with all propriety addressed to them; for the apostle says, "Quench not the Spirit;'' not that He can be quenched, but that those who so act as if they wished to have Him quenched are deservedly spoken of as quenchers of the Spirit. In this sense also may be rightly understood the words which most blessed Cyprian wrote in his letter concerning the lapsed, when, rebuking those who in the time of persecution had sacrificed to idols, he says, "And that nothing might be wanting to fill up the measure of their crime, their infant children, carried in arms, or led thither by the hands of their parents, lost, while yet in their infancy, that which they had received as soon as life began." They lost it, he meant, so far at least as pertained to the guilt of the crime of those by whom they were compelled to incur the loss: they lost it, that is to say, in the purpose and wish of those who perpetrated on them such a wrong. For had they actually in their own persons lost it, they must have remained under the divine sentence of condemnation without any plea; but if holy Cyprian had been of this opinion, he would not have added in the immediate context a plea in their defence, saying, "Shall not these say, when the judgment-day has come: 'We have done nothing; we have not of our own accord hastened to participate in profane rites, forsaking the bread and<br>
<br>
408<br>
<br>
the cup of the Lord; the apostasy of others caused our destruction; we found our parents murderers, for they deprived us of our Mother the Church and of our Father the Lord, so that, through the wrong done by others, we were en-snared, because, while yet young and unable to think for ourselves, we were by the deed of others, and while wholly ignorant of such a crime, made partners in their sin '?" This plea in their defence he would not have subjoined] had he not believed it to be perfectly just, and] one which would be of service to these infants ] at the bar of divine judgment. For if it is said by them with truth, "We have done nothing," then "the soul that sinneth, it shall die;" and I in the just dispensation of judgment by God, those shall not be doomed to perish whose souls their parents did, so far at least as concerns their own guilt in the transaction, bring to ruin.<br>
    4. As to the incident mentioned in the same letter, that a girl who was left as an infant in charge of her nurse, when her parents had escaped by sudden flight, and was made by that nurse to take part in the profane rites of idolatrous worship, had afterwards in the Church expelled from her mouth, by wonderful motions, the Eucharist when it was given to her, this seems to ate to have been caused by divine interposition, in order that persons of riper years might not imagine that in this sin they do no wrong to the children, but rather might understand, by means of a bodily action of obvious]' significance on the part of those who were unable ' to speak, that a miraculous warning was given to . themselves as to the course which would have i been becoming in persons who, after so great a i crime, rushed heedlessly to those sacraments] from which they ought by all means, in proof of ! penitence, to have abstained. When Divine: Providence does anything of this kind by means , of infant children, we must not believe that they i are acting under the guidance of knowledge and reason; just as we are not called upon to admire the wisdom of asses, because once God was , pleased to rebuke the madness of a prophet by 1 the voice of an ass.1 If, therefore, a sound exactly like the human voice was uttered by an 1 irrational animal, and this was to be ascribed to i a divine miracle, not to faculties belonging to the 1 ass, the Almighty could, in like manner, through 1 the spirit of an infant (in which reason was not 1 absent, but only slumbering undeveloped), make i manifest by a motion of its body something to i which those who had sinned against both their t own souls and their children behoved to give heed. But since a child cannot return to become again a part of the author of his natural life, so as to be one with him and in him, but is a wholly distinct individual, having a body and a soul of his own, "the soul that sinneth, it shall die."<br>
    5. Some, indeed, bring their little ones for baptism, not in the believing expectation that they shall be regenerated unto life eternal by spiritual grace, but because they think that by this as a remedy the children may recover or retain bodily health; but let not this disquiet your mind, because their regeneration is not prevented by the fact that this blessing has no place in the intention of those by whom they are presented for baptism. For by these persons the ministerial actions which are necessary are performed, and the sacramental words are pronounced, without which the infant cannot be consecrated to God, But the Holy Spirit who dwells in the saints, in those, namely, whom the glowing flame of love has fused together into the one Dove whose wings are covered with silver? accomplishes His work even by the ministry of bond-servants, of persons who are sometimes not only ignorant through simplicity, but even culpably unworthy to be employed by Him. The presentation of the little ones to receive the spiritual grace is the act not so much of those by whose hands they are borne up (although it is theirs also in part, if they themselves are good believers) as of the whole society of saints and believers. For it is proper to regard the infants as presented by all who take pleasure in their baptism, and through whose holy and perfectly-united love they are assisted in receiving the communion of the Holy Spirit. Therefore this is done by the whole mother Church, which is in the saints, because the whole Church is the parent of all the saints, and the whole Church is the parent of each one of them. For if the sacrament of Christian baptism, being always Due and the same, is of value even when administered by heretics, and though not in that case sufficing to secure to the baptized person participation in eternal life, does suffice to seal his consecration to God; and if this consecration makes him who, having the mark of the Lord, remains outside of the Lord's flock, guilty as a heretic, but reminds us at the same time that he .s to be corrected by sound doctrine, but not to be a second time consecrated by repetition of :he ordinance; -- if this be the case even in the baptism of heretics, how much more credible is t that within the Catholic Church that which s only straw should be of service in bearing the ;rain to the floor in which it is to be winnowed, md by means of which it is to be prepared for being added to the heap of good grain !<br>
    6. I would, moreover, wish you not to remain under the mistake of supposing that the bond<br>
409<br>
<br>
of guilt which is inherited from Adam cannot be cancelled in any other way than by the parents. themselves presenting their little ones to receive the grace of Christ; for you write: "As the parents have been the authors of the life which makes them liable to condemnation, the children should receive justification through the same channel, through the faith of the same parents;" whereas you see that many are not presented by parents, but also by any strangers whatever, as sometimes the infant children of slaves are presented by their masters. Sometimes also, when their parents are deceased, little orphans are baptized, being presented by those who had it in their power to manifest their compassion in' this way. Again, sometimes foundlings which heartless parents have exposed in order to their being cared for by any passer-by, are picked tip by holy virgins, and are presented for baptism by these persons, who neither have nor desire to have children of their own: and in this you behold precisely what was done in the case mentioned in the Gospel of the man wounded by thieves, and left half dead on the way, regarding whom the Lord asked who was neighbour to him, and received for answer: "He that showed mercy on him."1<br>
    7. That which you have placed at the end of your series of questions you have judged to be the most difficult, because of the jealous care! with which you are wont to avoid whatever is false. You state it thus: "If I place before you an infant, and ask, ' Will this child when he grows up be chaste ?' or' Will he not be a thief?' you will reply, ' I know not.' If I ask, ' Is he in his present infantile condition thinking what is good or thinking what is evil?' you will reply,' I know not.' If, therefore, you do not venture to take the responsibility of making any positive statement concerning either his conduct in after life or his thoughts at the time, what is that which parents do, when, in presenting their children for baptism, they as sureties (or sponsors) answer for the children, and say that they do that which at that age they are incapable even of understanding, or, at least, in regard to which their thoughts (if they can think) are hidden from us? For we ask those by whom the child is presented, ' Does he believe in God ?' and though at that age the child does not so much as know that there is a God, the sponsors reply, ' He believes;' and in like manner answer is returned by them to each of the other questions. Now I am surprised that parents can in these things answer so confidently on the chi!d's behalf as to say, at the time when they are answering the questions of the persons administering baptism, that the infant is doing what is so reremarkable and so excellent;<br>
and yet if at the same hour I were to add such questions as, ' Will the child who is now being baptized be chaste when he grows up? Will he not be a thief?' probably no one would presume to answer, ' He will' or 'He will not,' although there is no hesitation in giving the answer that the child believes in God, and turns himself to God." Thereafter you add this sentence in conclusion: "To these questions I pray you to condescend to give me a short reply, not silencing me by the traditional authority of custom, but satisfying me by arguments addressed to my reason."<br>
    8. While reading this letter of yours over and ]over again, and pondering its contents so far as my limited time permitted, memory recalled to me my friend Nebridius, who, while he was a most diligent and eager student of difficult problems, especially in the department of Christian doctrine, had an extreme aversion to the giving of a short answer to a great question. If any one insisted upon this, he was exceedingly displeased; and if he was not prevented by respect for the age or rank of the person, he indignantly rebuked such a questioner by stern looks and words; for he considered him unworthy to be investigating matters such as these, who did not know how much both might be said and behoved to be said on a subject of great importance. But I do not lose patience with you, as he was wont to do when one asked a brief reply; for you are, as I am, a bishop engrossed with many cares, and therefore have not leisure for reading any more than I have leisure for writing any prolix communication. He was then a young man, who was not satisfied with short statements on subjects of this kind, and being then himself at leisure, addressed his questions concerning the many topics discussed in our conversations to one who was also at leisure; whereas you, having regard to the circumstances both of yourself the questioner, and of me from whom you demand the reply, insist upon my giving you a short answer to the weighty question which you propound. Well, I shall do my best to satisfy you; the Lord help me to accomplish what you require.<br>
    9. You know that in ordinary parlance we often say, when Easter is approaching, "Tomorrow or the day after is the Lord's Passion," although He suffered so many years ago, and His passion was endured once for all time. In like manner, on Easter Sunday, we say, "This day the Lord rose from the dead," although so many years have passed since His resurrection. But no one is so foolish as to accuse us of falsehood when we use these phrases, for this reason, that we give such names to these days on the ground of a likeness between them and the days on which the events referred to actually tran-<br>
<br>
410<br>
<br>
spired, the day being called the day of that event, although it is not the very day on which! the event took place, but one corresponding to it by the revolution of the same time of the! year, and the event itself being said to take place on that day, because, although it really took place long before. it is on that day sacramentally celebrated. Was not Christ once for all offered up l in His own person as a sacrifice.? and yet, is He. not likewise offered up in the sacrament as a sacrifice, not only in the special solemnities of Easter, but also daily among our congregations; so that the man who, being questioned, answers that He is offered as a sacrifice in that ordinance, ! declares what is strictly true ? For if sacraments had not some points of real resemblance to the things of which they are the sacraments, they would not be sacraments at all. In most cases,' moreover, they do in virtue of this likeness bear the names of the realities which they resemble. As, therefore, in a certain manner the sacrament of Christ's body is Christ's body, and the sacrament of Christ's blood is Christ's blood,' in the same manner the sacrament of faith is faith. Now believing is nothing else than having faith; and accordingly, when, on behalf of an infant as yet incapable of exercising faith, the answer is given that he believes, this answer means that he has faith because of the sacrament of faith, and in like manner the answer is made that he turns himself to God because of the sacrament of conversion, since the answer itself belongs to the celebration of the sacrament. Thus the apostle says, in regard to this sacrament of Baptism: "We are buried with Christ by baptism into death."2 He does not say, "We have signified our being buried with Him," but "We have been buried with Him." He has therefore given to the sacrament pertaining to so great a transaction no other name than the word describing the transaction itself.<br>
    10. Therefore an infant, although he is not yet a believer in the sense of having that faith which includes the consenting will of those who exercise it, nevertheless becomes a believer through the sacrament of that faith. For as it is answered that he believes, so also he is called a believer, not because he assents to the truth by an act of his own judgment, but because he receives the sacrament of that truth. When, however, he begins to have the discretion of manhood, he will not repeat the sacrament, but understand its meaning, and become conformed to the truth which it contains, with his will also consenting. During the time in which he is by reason- of youth unable to do this, the sacrament will avail for his protection against adverse powers, and will avail so much on his behalf, that if before he arrives at the use of reason he depart from this life, he is delivered by Christian help, namely, by the love of the Church commending him through this sacrament unto God, from that condemnation which by one man entered into the world.3 He who does not believe this, and thinks that it is impossible, is assuredly an unbeliever, although he may have received the sacrament of faith; and far before him in merit is the infant which, though not yet possessing a faith helped by the understanding, is not obstructing faith by any antagonism of the understanding, and therefore receives with profit the sacrament of faith.<br>
    I have answered your questions, as it seems to me, in a manner which, if I were dealing with persons of weaker capacity and disposed to gainsaying, would be inadequate, but which is perhaps more than sufficient to satisfy peaceable and sensible persons. Moreover, I have not urged in my defence the mere fact that the custom is thoroughly established, but have to the best of my ability advanced reasons in support of it as fraught with very abundant blessing.<br>

                             LETTER XCIX.<br>
                    (A.D. 408 OR BEGINNING OF 409.)<br>
<br>
	TO THE VERY DEVOUT ITALICA, AN HANDMAID OF GOD, PRAISED JUSTLY AND PIOUSLY BY THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. Up to the time of my writing this reply, I had received three letters from your Grace, of which the first asked urgently a letter from me, the second intimated that what I wrote in answer had reached you, and the third, which conveyed the assurance of your most benevolent solicitude for our interest in the matter of the house belonging to that most illustrious and distinguished young man Julian, which is in immediate contact with the walls of our Church. To this last letter, just now received, I lose no time in promptly replying, because your Excellency's agent has written to me that he can send my letter without delay to Rome. By his letter we have been greatly distressed, because he has taken pains to acquaint us 4 with the things which are taking place in the city (Rome) or around its walls, so as to give us reliable information concerning that which we were reluctant to believe on the authority of vague rumours. In the letters which<br>
<br>
411<br>
<br>
were sent to us previously by our brethren, tidings were given to us of events, vexatious and grievous, it is true, but much less calamitous than those' of which we now hear. I am surprised beyond expression that my brethren the holy bishops did not write to me when so favourable an opportunity of sending a letter by your messengers occurred, and that your own letter conveyed to us no information concerning such painful tribulation as has befallen you, -- tribulation which, by reason of the tender sympathies of Christian charity, is ours as well as yours. I suppose, however, that you deemed it better not to mention these sorrows, because you considered that this could do no good, or because you did not wish to make us sad by your letter. But in my opinion, it does some good to acquaint us even with such events as these: in the first place, because it is not right to be ready to "rejoice with them that rejoice," but refuse to "weep with them that weep;" and in the second place, because "tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."1<br>
    2. Far be it, therefore, from us to refuse to hear even of the bitter and sorrowful things which befall those who are very dear to us! For in some way which I cannot explain, the pain suffered by one member is mitigated when all the other members suffer with it.2 And this mitigation is effected not by actual participation in the calamity, but by the solacing power of love; for although only some suffer the actual burden of the affliction, and the others share their suffering through knowing what these have to bear, nevertheless the tribulation is borne in common by them all, seeing that they have in common the same experience, hope, and love, and the same Divine Spirit. Moreover, the Lord provides consolation for us all, inasmuch as He hath both forewarned us of these temporal afflictions, and promised to us after them eternal blessings; and the soldier who desires to receive a crown when the conflict is over, ought not to lose courage while the conflict lasts, since He who is preparing rewards ineffable for those who overcome, does Himself minister strength to them while they are on the field to baffle.<br>
    3. Let not what I have now written take away your confidence in writing to me, especially since the reason which may be pied for your endeavouring to lessen our fears is one which cannot be condemned. We salute in return your little children, and we desire that they may be spared to you, and may grow up in Christ, since they discern even in their present tender age how dangerous and baneful is the love of this world. I God grant that the plants which are small and still flexible may be bent in the right direction in a time in which the great and hardy are being shaken. As to the house of which you speak, !what can I say beyond expressing my gratitude for ),our very kind solicitude ? For the house which we can give they do not wish; and the house which they wish we cannot give, for it was not left to the church by my predecessor, as they have been falsely informed, but is one of the ancient properties of the church, and it is attached to the one ancient church in the same way as the house about which this question has been raised is attached to the other.3<br>
<br>
            LETTER C. (A.D, 409) TO DONATUS HIS NOBLE AND&nbsp;<br>
       DESERVEDLY HONOURABLE LORD, AND EMINENTLY' PRAISEWORTHY'<br>
               SON, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
                 I. I would indeed that the African Church<br>
    were not placed in such trying circumstances as to need the aid of any earthly power. But since, as the apostle says, there is no power but of God," 4 it is unquestionable that, when by you the sincere sons of your Catholic Mother help is given to her, our help is in the name of the Lord, "who made heaven and earth "s For oh noble and deservedly honourable lord, and eminently praiseworthy sone lord, and eminently who does not perceive that in the midst of so great calamities no small consolation has been bestowed upon us by God, ' in that you, such a man, and so devoted to the name of Christ, have been raised to the dignity of proconsul, so that power allied with your goodwill may restrain the enemies of the Church from their wicked and sacrilegious attempts ? In fact, there is only one thing of which we are much afraid in your administration of justice, viz., lest perchance, seeing that every injury done by impious and ungrateful men against the Christian society is a more serious and heinous crime than t if it had been done against others, you should on this ground consider that it ought to be punished with a severity corresponding to the enormity of the crime, and not with the moderation which is suitable to Christian forbearance. We beseech you, in the name of Jesus Christ, not to act in this manner. For we do not seek to revenge ourselves in this world; nor ought the things which we suffer to reduce us to such distress of mind as to leave no room in our memory for the precepts in regard to this which we have<br>
<br>
412<br>
<br>
received from Him for whose truth and in whose name we suffer; we "love our enemies," and we "pray for them." ' It is not their death, but their deliverance from error, that we seek to accomplish by the help of the terror of judges and of laws, whereby they may be preserved from falling under the penalty of eternal judgment; we do not wish either to see the exercise of discipline towards them neglected, or, on the other hand, to see them subjected to the severer punishments which they deserve. Do you, therefore, check their sins in such a way, that the sinners may be spared to repent of their sins.<br>
    2. We beg you, therefore, when you are pronouncing judgment in cases affecting the Church, how wicked soever the injuries may be which you. shall ascertain to have been attempted or inflicted on the Church, to forget that you have tim power of capital punishment, and not to forget our request. Nor let it appear to you an unimportant t matter and beneath your notice, my most beloved and honoured son, that we ask you to spare the lives of the men on whose behalf we ask God to grant them repentance. For even granting that we ought never to deviate from a fixed purpose of overcoming evil with good, let your own wisdom take this also into consideration, that no person beyond those who belong to the Church is at pains to bring before you cases pertaining to her interests. If, therefore, your opinion be, that death must be the punishment of men convicted of these crimes, you will deter us from endeavouring to bring anything of this kind before your tribunal; and this being discovered, they will proceed with more unrestrained boldness to accomplish speedily our destruction, when upon us is imposed and enjoined the necessity of choosing rather to suffer death at their hands, than to bring them to death by accusing them at your bar. Disdain not, I beseech you, to accept this suggestion, petition, and entreaty from me. For I do not think that you are unmindful that I might have great boldness in addressing you, even were I not a bishop, and even though your rank were much above what you now hold. Meanwhile, let the Donatist heretics learn at once through the edict of your Excellency that the laws passed against their error, which they suppose and boastfully declare to be repealed, are still in force, although even when they know this they may not be able to refrain in the least degree from injuring us. You will, however, most effectively help us to secure the fruit of our labours and dangers, if you take care that the imperial laws for the restraining of their sect, which is full of conceit and of impious pride, be so used that they may not appear either to themselves or to others to be suffering hardship in any form for the sake of truth and righteousness; but suffer them, when this is requested at i your hands, to be convinced and instructed by incontrovertible proofs of things which are most certain, in public proceedings in the presence of your Excellency or of inferior judges, in order that those who are arrested by your command may themselves incline their stubborn will to the better part, and may read these things profitably to others of their party. For the pains bestowed are burdensome rather than really useful, when men are only compelled, not persuaded by instruction, to forsake a great evil and lay hold upon a great benefit.<br>
<br>
                        LETTER CI. (A.D. 409.)<br>
	TO MEMOR,2 MY LORD MOST BLESSED, AND WITH ALL VENERATION MOST BELOVED, MY BROTHER AND COLLEAGUE SINCERELY LONGED FOR, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. I ought not to write any letter to your holy Charity, without sending at the same time those books which by the irresistible plea of holy love you have demanded from me, that at least by this act of obedience I might reply to those letters by which you have put on me a high honour indeed, but also a heavy load. Albeit, while I bend because of the load, I am raised up because of your love. For it is not by an ordinary man that I am loved and raised up and made to stand erect, but by a man who is a priest of the Lord, and whom I know to be so accepted before Him, that when you raise to the Lord your good heart, having me in )'our heart, you raise me with yourself to Him. I ought, therefore, to have sent at this time those books which I had promised to revise. The reason why I have not sent them is that I have not revised them, and this not because I was unwilling, but because 1: was unable, having been occupied with many very urgent cares. But it would have shown inexcusable ingratitude and hardness of heart to have permitted the bearer, my holy colleague and brother Possidius, in whom you will find one who is very much the same as myself, either to miss becoming acquainted with you, who love me so much, or to come to know you without any letter from me. For he is one who has been by my labours nourished, not in those studies which men who are the slaves of every kind of passion call liberal, but with the Lord's bread, in so far as this could be supplied to him from my scanty store.<br>
    2. For to men who, though they are unjust and impious, imagine that they are well educated<br>
<br>
413<br>
<br>
in the liberal arts, what else ought we to say than what we read in those writings which truly merit the name of liberal,- "if the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."' For it is through Him that men come to know, even in those studies which are termed liberal by those who have not been called to this true liberty, anything in them which deserves the name. For they have nothing which is consonant with liberty, except that which in them is consonant with truth; for which reason the Son Himself hath said: "The truth shall make you free."2 The freedom which is our privilege has therefore nothing in common with the innumerable and impious fables with which the verses of silly poets are full, nor with the fulsome and highly-polished falsehoods of their orators, nor, in rifle, with the rambling subtleties of philosophers themselves, who either did not know anything of God, or when they knew God, did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; so that, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and. changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed beasts, and to creeping things, or who, though not wholly or at all devoted to the worship of images, nevertheless worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator.s Far be it, therefore, from us to admit that the epithet liberal is justly bestowed on the lying vanities and hallucinations, or empty trifles and conceited errors of those men- unhappy men, who knew not the grace of God in Christ Jesus our Lord, by which alone we are "delivered from the body of this death," 4 and who did not even perceive the measure of truth which was in the things which they knew. Their historical works, the writers of which profess to be chiefly concerned to be accurate in narrating events, may perhaps, I grant, contain some things worthy of being known by "free" men, since the narration is true, whether the subject described in it be the good or the evil in human experience. At the same time, I can by no means see how men who were not aided in their knowledge by the Holy Spirit, and who were obliged to gather floating rumours under the limitations of human infirmity, could avoid being misled in regard to very many things; nevertheless, if they have no intention of deceiving, and do not mislead other men otherwise than so far as they have themselves, through human infirmity, fallen into a mistake, there is in such writings an approach to liberty.<br>
<br>
    3. Forasmuch, however, as the powers belonging to numbers s in all kinds of movements are most easily studied as they axe presented in sounds, and this study furnishes a way of rising to the higher secrets of truth, by paths gradually ascending, so to speak, in which Wisdom pleasantly reveals herself, and in every step of providence meets those who love her,6  desired, when I began to have leisure for study, and my mind was not engaged by greater and more important cares, to exercise myself by writing those books which you have requested me to send. I then wrote six books on rhythm alone, and proposed,<br>
    may add, to write other six on music,7 as I at that time expected to have leisure. But from the time that the burden of ecclesiastical cares was laid upon me, all these recreations have passed from my hand so completely, that now, when I cannot but respect your wish and command, -- for it is more than a request, -- I have difficulty in even finding what I had written. If, however, I had it in my power to send you that treatise, it would occasion regret, not to me that I had obeyed your command, but to you that you had so urgently insisted upon its being sent. For five books of it are all but unintelligible, unless one be at hand who can in reading not only distinguish the part belonging to each of those between whom the discussion is maintained, but also mark by enunciation the time which the syllables should occupy, so that their distinctive measures may be expressed and strike the ear, especially because in some places there occur pauses of measured length, which of course must escape notice, unless the reader inform the hearer of them by intervals of silence where they occur.<br>
    The sixth book, however, which I have found already revised, and in which the product of the other five is contained, I have not delayed to send to your Charity; it may, perhaps, be not wholly unsuited to one of your venerable age.s As to the other five books, they seem to me scarcely worthy of being known and read by Julian,9 our son, and now our colleague, for, as a deacon, he is engaged in the same warfare with ourselves. Of him I dare not say, for it would not be true, that I love him more than I love you; yet this I may say, that I long for him more than for you. It may seem strange, that when I love both equally, I long more ardently for the one than the other; but the cause of the difference is, that I have greater hope of seeing him; for I think that if ordered or sent by you he come to us, he will both be doing what is<br>
<br>
414<br>
<br>
suitable to one of his years, especially as he is not yet hindered by weightier responsibilities, and he will more speedily bring yourself to me.<br>
    I have not stated in this treatise the kinds of metre in which the lines of David's Psalms are composed, because I do not know them. For it was not possible for any one, in translating these from the Hebrew (of which language I know nothing), to preserve the metre at the same time, lest by the exigencies of the measure he should be compelled to depart from accurate translation further than was consistent with the meaning of the sentences. Nevertheless, I believe, on the testimony of those who are acquainted with that language, that they are composed in certain varieties of metre; for that holy man loved sacred music, and has more than any other kindled in me a passion for its study.<br>
    May the shadow of the wings of the Most High be for ever the dwelling-place' of you all, who with oneness of heart occupy one home? father and mother, bound in the same brotherhood with your sons, being all the children of the one Father. Remember us.<br>
<br>
                        LETTER CII. (A.D. 409.)<br>
<br>
	TO DEOGRATIAS, MY BROTHER IN ALL SINCERITY, AND MY FELLOW-PRESBYTER, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. In choosing to refer to me questions which were submitted to yourself for solution, you have not done so, I suppose, from indolence, but because, loving me more than I deserve, you prefer to hear through me even those things which you already know quite well. I would rather, however, that the answers were given by yourself, because the friend who proposed the questions seems to be shy of following advice from me, if I may judge from the fact that he has written no reply to a letter of mine, for what reason he knows best. I suspect this, 'however, and there is neither ill-will nor absurdity in the suspicion; for you also know very well how much I love him, and how great is my grief that he is not yet a Christian; and it is not unreasonable to think that one whom I see unwilling to answer my letters is not willing to have anything written by me to him. I therefore implore you to comply with a request of mine, seeing that I have been obedient to you, and, notwithstanding most engrossing duties, have feared to disappoint the wish of one so dear to me by declining to comply with your request. What I ask is this, that you do not refuse yourself to give an answer to all his questions, seeing that, as you have told me, he begged this from you; and it is a task to which, even before receiving this letter, you were competent; for when you have read this letter, you will see that scarcely anything has been said by me which you did not already know, or which you could not have come to know though I had been silent. This work of mine, therefore, I beg you to keep for the use of yourself and of all other persons whose desire for instruction you deem it suited to satisfy. But as for the treatise of your own composition which I demand from you, give it to him to whom this treatise is most specially adapted, and not to him only, but also all others who find exceedingly acceptable such statements concerning these things as you are able to make, among whom I number myself. May you live always in Christ, and remember<br>
me.<br>
    2. QUESTION I. Concerning the resurrection. This question perplexes some, and they ask, Which of two kinds of resurrection corresponds to that which is promised to us? is it that of Christ, or that of Lazarus ? They say, "If the former, how can this correspond with the resurrection of those who have been born by ordinary generations, seeing that He was not thus born ? 3 If, on the other hand, the resurrection of Lazarus is said to correspond to ours, here also there seems to be a discrepancy, since the resurrection of Lazarus was accomplished in the case of a body not yet dissolved, but the same body in which he was known by the name of Lazarus; whereas ours is to be rescued after many centuries from the mass in which it has ceased to be distinguishable from other things. Again, if our state after the resurrection is one of blessedness, in which i the body shall be exempt from every kind of wound, and from the pain of hunger, what is :meant by the statement that Christ took food, and showed his wounds after His resurrection? For if He did it to convince the doubting, when the wounds were not real, He practised on them a deception; whereas, if He showed them what was real, it follows that wounds received by the body shall remain in the state which is to ensue after resurrection."<br>
    3. To this I answer, that the resurrection of Christ and not of Lazarus corresponds to that which is promised, because Lazarus was so raised that he died a second time, whereas of Christ it is written: "Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over Him."4 The same is promised to those who shall rise at the end of the world, and shall reign for ever with Christ. As to the difference in the manner of Christ's generation and that of other men, this has no bearing upon the nature<br>
<br>
415<br>
<br>
of His resurrection, just as it had none upon the nature of His death, so as to make it different from ours. His death was not the less real because of His not having been begotten by an earthly father; just as the difference between the' mode of the origination of the body of the first man, who was formed immediately from the dust of the earth, and of our bodies, which we derive from our parents, made no such difference as that his death should be of another kind than ours. As, therefore, difference in the mode of birth does not make any difference in the nature of death, neither does it make any difference in the nature of resurrection.<br>
    4. But lest the men who doubt this should, with similar scepticism, refuse to accept as true what is written concerning the first man's creation, let them inquire or observe, if they can at least believe this, how numerous are the species of animals which are born from the earth without deriving their life from parents, but which by ordinary procreation reproduce offspring like themselves, and in which, notwithstanding the different mode of origination, the nature of the parents born from the earth and of the offspring born from them is the same; for they live alike and they die alike, although born in different ways. There is therefore no absurdity in the statement that bodies dissimilar in their origination are alike in their resurrection. But men of this kind, not being competent to discern in what respect any diversity between things affects or does not affect them, so soon as they discover any unlikeness between things in their original formation, contend that in all that follows the same unlikeness must still exist. Such men may as reasonably suppose that oil made from fat should not float on the surface in water as olive oil does, because the origin of the two oils is so different, the one being from the fruit of a tree, the other from the flesh of an animal.<br>
    5. Again, as to the alleged difference in regard to the resurrection of Christ's body and of ours, that His was raised on the third day not dissolved by decay and corruption, whereas ours shall be fashioned again after a long time, and out of the mass into which undistinguished they shall have been resolved, --both of these things are impossible for man to do, but to divine power both are most easy. For as the glance' of the eye does not come more quickly to objects which are at hand, and more slowly to objects more remote, but darts to either distance with equal swiftness, so, when the resurrection of the dead is accomplished "in the twinkling of an eye,"1 it is as easy for the omnipotence of God and for the ineffable expression of His will 2 to raise again bodies which have by long lapse of time been dissolved, as to raise 'those which have recently fallen under the stroke of death. These things are to some men incredible because they transcend their experience, although all nature 'is full of wonders so numerous, that they do not seem to us to be wonderful, and are therefore accounted unworthy of attentive study or investigation, not because our faculties can easily comprehend them, but because we are so accustomed to see them. For myself, and for all who along with me labour to understand the invisible things of God by means of the things which are made,3 I may say that we are filled not less, perhaps even more, with wonder by the fact, that in one grain of seed, so insignificant, there lies bound up as it were all that we praise in the stately tree, than by the fact that the bosom of this earth, so vast, shall restore entire and perfect to the future resurrection all those elements of human bodies which it is now receiving when they are dissolved.<br>
    6. Again, what contradiction is there between the fact that Christ partook of food after His resurrection, and the doctrine that in the promised resurrection-state there shall be no need of food, when we read that angels also have partaken of food of the same kind and in the same way, not in empty and illusive simulation, but in unquestionable reality; not, however, under the pressure of necessity, but in the free exercise of their power? For water is absorbed in one way by the thirsting earth, in another way by the glowing J sunbeams; in the former we see the effect of poverty, in the latter of power Now the body of that future resurrection-state shall be imperfect in its felicity if it be incapable of taking food; imperfect, also, if, on the other hand, it be dependent on food. I might here enter on a fuller discussion concerning the changes possible in the qualities of bodies, and the dominion which belongs to higher bodies over those which are of inferior nature; but I have resolved to make my reply short, and I write this for mind so endowed that the simple suggestion of the truth 'is enough for them.<br>
    7. Let him who proposed these questions know by all means that Christ did, after His resurrection, show the scars of His wounds, not the wounds themselves, to disciples who doubted; for whose sake, also, it pleased Him to take food and drink more than once, lest they should suppose that His body was not real, but that He was a spirit, appearing to them as a phantom, and not a substantial form. These scars would indeed have been mere illusive appearances if no wounds had gone before; yet even the scars would not have remained if He had willed it otherwise. But it pleased Him to retain them<br>
<br>
416<br>
<br>
with a definite purpose, namely, that to those whom He was building up in faith unfeigned He might show that one body had not been substituted for another, but that the body which they had seen nailed to the cross had risen again. What reason is there, then, for saying, "If He did this to convince the doubting, He practised a deception "? Suppose that a brave man, who had received many wounds in confronting the enemy when fighting for his country, were to say to a physician of extraordinary skill, who was able so to heal these wounds as to leave not a scar visible, that he would prefer to be healed in such a way that the traces of the wounds should remain on his body as tokens of the honours he had won, would you, in such a case, say that the physician practised deception, because, though he might by his art make the scars wholly disappear, he did by the same art, for a definite reason, rather cause them to continue as they were? The only ground upon which the scars could be proved to be a deception would be, as I have already said, if no wounds had been healed in the places where they were seen.<br>
    8. QUESTION II. Concerning the epoch of the Christian religion, they have advanced, moreover, some other things, which they might call a selection of the more weighty arguments of Porphyry against the Christians: "If Christ," they say, "declares Himself to be the Way of salvation, the Grace and the Truth, and affirms that in Him alone, and only to souls believing in Him, is the way of return to God,' what has become of men who lived in the many centuries before Christ came? To pass over the time," he adds, "which preceded the rounding of the kingdom of Latium, let us take the beginning of that power as if it were the beginning of the human race. In Latium itself gods were worshipped before Alba was built; in Alba, also, religious rites and forms of worship in the temples were maintained. Rome itself was for a period of not less duration, even for a long succession of centuries, unacquainted with Christian doctrine. What, then, has become of such an innumerable multitude of souls, who were in no wise blameworthy, seeing that He in whom alone saving faith can be exercised had not yet favoured men with His advent ? The whole world, moreover, was not less zealous than Rome itself in the worship practised in the temples of the gods. Why, then," he asks, "did He who is called the Saviour withhold Himself for so many centuries of the world ? And let it not be said," he adds, "that provision had been made for the human race by the old Jewish law. It was only after a long time that the Jewish law appeared and flourished within the narrow limits of Syria, and after that, it gradually crept onwards to the coasts of Italy; but this was not earlier than the end of the reign of Caius, or, at the earliest, while he was on the throne. What, then, became of the souls of men in Rome and Latium who lived before the time of the Caesars, and were destitute of the grace of Christ, because He had not then come ?"<br>
    9. To these statements we answer by requiring those who make them to tell us, in the first place, whether the sacred rites, which we know to have been introduced into the worship of their gods at times which can be ascertained, were or were not profitable to men. If they say that these were of no service for the salvation of men, they unite with us in putting them down, and confess that they were useless. We indeed prove that they were baneful; but it is an important concession that by them it is at least admitted that they were useless. If, on the other hand, they defend these rites, and maintain that they were wise and profitable institutions, what, I ask, has become of those who died before these were instituted ? for they were defrauded of the saving and profitable efficacy which these possessed. If, however, it be said that they could be cleansed from guilt equally well in another way, why did not the same way continue in force for their posterity? What use was there for instituting novelties in worship.<br>
    10. If, in answer to this, they say that the gods themselves have indeed always existed, and were in all places alike powerful to give liberty to their worshippers, but were pleased to regulate the circumstances of time, place, and manner in which they were to be served, according to the variety found among things temporal and terrestrial, in such a way as they knew to be most suitable to certain ages and countries, why do they urge against the Christian religion this question, which, if it be asked in regard to their own gods, they either cannot themselves answer, or, if they can, must do so in such a way as to answer for our religion not less than their own ? For what could they say but that the difference between sacraments which are adapted to different times and places is of no importance, if only that which is worshipped in them all be holy, just as the difference between sounds of words belonging to different languages and adapted to different hearers is of no importance, if only that which is spoken be true; although in this respect there is a difference, that men can, by agreement among themselves, arrange as to the sounds of language by which they may communicate their thoughts to one another, but that those who have discerned what is right have been guided only by the will of God in regard<br>
to the sacred rites which were agreeable to the Divine Being. This divine will has never been<br>
<br>
417<br>
<br>
wanting to the justice and piety of mortals for their salvation; and whatever varieties of worship there may have been in different nations bound together by one and the same religion, the most important thing to observe was this how far, on the one hand, human infirmity was thereby encouraged to effort, or borne with while, on the other hand, the divine authority was not assailed.<br>
    11. Wherefore, since we affirm that Christ is the Word of God, by whom all things were made and is the Son, because He is the Word, not a word uttered and belonging to the past but abides unchangeably with the unchangeable Father, Himself unchangeable, under whose rule the whole universe, spiritual and material, is ordered in the way best adapted to different times and places, and that He has perfect wisdom and knowledge as to what should be done, and when and where everything should be done in the controlling and ordering of the universe,--most certainly, both before He gave being to the Hebrew nation, by which He was pleased, through sacraments suited to the time, to prefigure the manifestation of Himself in His advent, and during the time of the Jewish commonwealth, and, after that, when He manifested Himself in the likeness of mortals to mortal men in the body which He received from the Virgin, and thenceforward even to our day, in which He is fulfilling all which He predicted of old by the prophets, and from this present time on to the end of the world, when He shall separate the holy from the wicked, and give to every man his due recompense,- in all these successive ages He is the same Son of God, co-eternal with the Father, and the unchangeable Wisdom by whom universal nature was called into existence, and by participation in whom every rational soul is made blessed.<br>
    12. Therefore, from the beginning of the human race, whosoever believed in Him, and in any way knew Him, and lived in a pious and just manner according to His precepts, was undoubtedly saved by Him, in whatever time and place he may have lived. For as we believe in Him both as dwelling with the Father and as having come in the flesh, so the men of the former ages believed in Him both as dwelling with the Father and as destined to come in the flesh. And the nature of faith is not changed, nor is the salvation made different, in our age, by the fact that, in consequence of the difference between the two epochs, that which was then foretold as future is now proclaimed as past. Moreover, we are not under necessity to suppose different things and different kinds of salvation to be signified, when the self-same thing is by different sacred words and rites of worship announced in the one case as fulfilled, in the other as future. As to the manner and time, however, in which anything that pertains to the one salvation common to all believers and pious persons is brought to pass, let us ascribe wisdom to God, and for our part exercise submission to His will. Wherefore the true religion, although formerly set forth and practised under other names and with other symbolical rites than it now has, and formerly more obscurely revealed and known to fewer persons than now in the time of clearer light and wider diffusion, is one and the same in both periods.<br>
    13. Moreover, we do not raise any objection to their religion on the ground of the difference between the institutions appointed by Numa Pompilius for the worship of the gods. by the Romans, and those which were up till that time practised in Rome or in other parts of Italy; nor on the fact that in the age of Pythagoras that system of philosophy became generally adopted which up to that time had no existence, or lay concealed, perhaps, among a very small number whose views were the same, but 'whose religious practice and worship was different: the question upon which we join issue with them is, whether these gods were true gods, or worthy of worship, and whether that philosophy was fitted to promote the salvation of the souls of men. This is what we insist upon discussing; and in discussing it we pluck up their sophistries by the root. Let them, therefore, desist from bringing against us objections which are of equal force against every sect, and against religion of every name. For since, as they admit, the ages of the world do not roll on under the dominion of chance, but are controlled by divine Providence, what may be fitting and expedient in each successive age transcends the range of human understanding, and is determined by the same wisdom by which Providence cares for the universe.<br>
    14. For if they assert that the reason why the doctrine of Pythagoras has not prevailed always and universally is, that Pythagoras was but a man, and had not power to secure this, can they also affirm that in the age and in the countries in which his philosophy flourished, all who had the opportunity of hearing him were found willing to believe and follow him ? And therefore it is the more certain that, if Pythagoras had possessed the power of publishing his doctrines where he pleased and when he pleased, and if he had also possessed along with that power a perfect foreknowledge of events, he would have presented himself only at those places and times in which he foreknew that men would believe his teaching. Wherefore, since they do not object to Christ on the ground of His doctrine not being universally embraced,- for they feel that this would be a futile objection if alleged either<br>
<br>
418<br>
<br>
against the teaching of philosophers or against the majesty of their own gods, --what answer, I ask, could they make, if, leaving out of view that depth of the wisdom and knowledge of God within which it may be that some other divine purpose lies much more deeply hidden, and without prejudging the other reasons possibly existing, which are fit subjects for patient study by the wise, we confine ourselves, for the sake of brevity in this discussion, to the statement of this one position, that it pleased Christ to appoint the time in which He would appear and the persons among whom His doctrine was to be proclaimed, according to His knowledge of the times and places in which men would believe on Him ?r For He foreknew, regarding those ages and places in which His gospel has not been preached, that in them the gospel, if preached, would meet with such treatment from all, without exception, as it met with, not indeed from all, but from many, at the time of His personal presence on earth, who would not believe in Him, even though men were raised from the dead by Him; and such as we see it meet with in our day from many who, although the predictions of the prophets concerning Him are so manifestly fulfilled, still refuse to believe, and, misguided by the perverse subtlety of the human heart, rather resist than yield to divine authority, even when this is so clear and manifest, so glorious and so gloriously published abroad. So long as the mind of man is limited in capacity and in strength, it is his duty to yield to divine truth. Why, then, should we wonder if Christ knew that the world was so full of unbelievers in the former ages, that He righteously refused to manifest Himself or to be preached to those of whom He foreknew that they would not believe either His words or His miracles? For it is not incredible that all may have been then such as, to our amazement, so many have been from the time of His advent to the present time, and even now are.<br>
    15. And yet, from the beginning of the human race, He never ceased to speak by His prophets, at one time more obscurely, at another time more plainly, as seemed to divine wisdom best adapted to the time i nor were there ever wanting men who believed in Him, from Adam to Moses, and among the people of Israel itself, which was by a special mysterious appointment a prophetic nation, and among other nations before He came in the flesh. For seeing that in the sacred Hebrew books some are mentioned, even from Abraham's time, not belonging to his natural posterity nor to the people of Israel, and not proselytes added to that people, who were nevertheless partakers of this holy mystery? why may we not believe that in other nations also, here and there, some more were found, although we do not read their names in these authoritative records? Thus the salvation provided by this religion, by which alone, as alone true, true salvation is truly promised, was never wanting to any one who was worthy of it, and he to whom it was wanting was not worthy of it.3 And from the beginning of the human family, even to the end of time, it is preached, to some for their advantage, to some for their condemnation. Accordingly, those to whom it has not been preached at all are those who were foreknown as persons who would not believe; those to whom, notwithstanding the certainty that they would not believe, the salvation has been proclaimed are set forth as an example of the class of unbelievers; and those to whom, as persons who would believe, the truth is proclaimed are being prepared for the kingdom of heaven and for the society of the holy angels.<br>
    16. QUESTION III. Let us now look to the question which comes next in order. "They find fault," he says, "with the sacred ceremonies, the sacrificial victims, the burning of incense, and all the other parts of worship in our temples; and yet the same kind of worship had its origin in antiquity with themselves, or from the God whom they worship, for He is represented by them as having been in need of the first-fruits."<br>
    17. This question is obviously founded upon the passage in our Scriptures in which it is written that Cain brought to God a gift from the fruits of the earth, but Abel brought a gift from the firstlings of the flock.4 Our reply, therefore, is, that from this passage the more suitable inference to be drawn is, how ancient is the ordinance of sacrifice which the infallible and sacred<br>
<br>
419<br>
<br>
writings declare to be due to no other than to the one true God; not because God needs our offerings, seeing that, in the same Scriptures, it is most clearly written, "I said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord, for Thou hast no need of my good,"' but because, even in the acceptance or rejection or appropriation of these offerings, He considers the advantage of men, and of them alone. For in worshipping God we do good to ourselves, not to Him. When, therefore, He gives an inspired revelation, and teaches how He is to be worshipped, He does this not only from no sense of need on His part, but from a regard to our highest advantage. For all such sacrifices are significant, being symbols of certain things by which we ought to be roused to search or know or recollect the things which they symbolize. To discuss this subject satisfactorily would demand of us something more than the short discourse in which we have resolved to give our reply at this time, more particularly because in other treatises we have spoken of it fully.' Those also who have before us expounded the divine oracles, have spoken largely of the symbols of the sacrifices of the Old Testament as shadows and figures of things then future.<br>
    18. With all our desire, however, to be brief, this one thing we must by no means omit to remark, that the false gods, that is to say, the demons, which are lying angels, would never have required a temple, priesthood, sacrifice, and the other things connected with these from their worship-pets, whom they deceive, had they not known that these things were due to the one true God. When, therefore, these things are presented to God according to His inspiration and teaching, it is true religion; but when they are given to demons in compliance with their impious pride, it is baneful superstition. Accordingly, those who know the Christian Scriptures of both the Old and the New Testaments do not blame the profane rites of Pagans on the mere ground of their building temples, appointing priests, and offering sacrifices, but on the ground of their doing all this for idols and demons. As to idols, indeed, who entertains a doubt as to their being wholly devoid of perception? And yet, when they are placed in these temples and set on high upon thrones of honour, that they may be waited upon by suppliants and worshippers praying and offering sacrifices, even these idols, though devoid both of feeling and of life, do, by the mere image of the members and senses of beings endowed with life, so affect weak minds, that they appear to live and breathe, especially under the added influence of the profound veneration with which the multitude freely renders such costly service.<br>
<br>
    19. To these morbid and pernicious affections of the mind divine Scripture applies a remedy, by repeating, with the impressiveness of wholesome admonition, a familiar fact, in the words, "Eyes have they, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not,"3 etc. For these words, by reason of their being so plain, and commending themselves to all people as true, are the more effective in striking salutary shame into those who, when they present divine worship before such images with religious fear, and look upon their likeness to living beings while they are venerating and worshipping them, and utter petitions, offer sacrifices, and perform vows before them as if present, are so completely overcome, that they do not presume to think of them as devoid of perception. Lest, moreover, these worshippers should think that our Scriptures intend only to declare that such affections of the human heart spring naturally from the worship of idols, it is written in the plainest terms, "All the gods of the nations are devils." 4 And therefore, also, the teaching of the apostles not only declares, as we read in John, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols," s but also, in the words of Paul, "What say I then ? that the idol is anything, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything? But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils, and not to God; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils." 6 From which it may be clearly understood, that what is condemned in heathen superstitions by the true religion is not the mere offering of sacrifices (for the ancient saints offered these to the true God), but the offering of sacrifices to false gods and to impious demons. For as the truth counsels men to seek the fellowship of the holy angels, in like manner impiety turns men aside to the fellowship of the wicked angels, for whose associates everlasting fire is prepared, as the eternal kingdom is prepared for the associates of the holy angels.<br>
    20. The heathen find a plea for their profane rites and their idols in the fact that they interpret with ingenuity what is signified by each of them, but the plea is of no avail. For all this interpretation relates to the creature, not to the Creator, to whom alone is due that religious service which is in the Greek language distinguished by the word &lt;greek>latreia&lt;/greek>. Neither do we say that the earth, the seas, the heaven, the sun, the moon, the stars, and any other celestial influences which may be beyond our ken are demons; but since all created things are divided into material and immaterial, the latter of which we also call spir-<br>
<br>
420<br>
<br>
itual, it is manifest that what is done by us under the power of piety and religion proceeds from the faculty of our souls known as the will, which belongs to the spiritual creation, and is therefore to be preferred to all that is material. Whence it is inferred that sacrifice must not be offered to anything material. There remains, therefore, the spiritual part of creation, which is either pious or impious,- the pious consisting of men and angels who are righteous, and who duly serve God; the impious consisting of wicked men and angels, whom we also call devils. Now, that sacrifice must not be offered to a spiritual creature, though righteous, is obvious from this consideration, that the more pious and submissive to God any creature is, the less does he presume to aspire to that honour which he knows to be due to God alone. How much worse, therefore, is it to sacrifice to devils, that is, to a wicked spiritual creature, which, dwelling in this comparatively dark heaven nearest to earth, as in the prison assigned to him in the air, is doomed to eternal punishment. Wherefore, even when men say that they are offering sacrifices to the higher celestial powers, which are not devils, and imagine that the only difference between us and them is in a name, because they call them gods and we call them angels, the only beings which really present themselves to these men, who are given over to be the sport of manifold deceptions, are the devils who find de-I light and, in a sense, nourishment in the errors' of mankind. For the holy angels do not approve of any sacrifice except what is offered, agreeably to the teaching of true wisdom and' true religion, unto the one true God, whom in! holy fellowship they serve. Therefore, as impious presumption, whether in men or in angels, ! commands or covets the rendering to itself of those honours which belong to God, so, on the other hand, pious humility, whether in men or in holy angels, declines these honours when offered, and declares to whom alone they are due, ! of which most notable examples are conspicuously set forth in our sacred books.<br>
    21. In the sacrifices appointed by the divine oracles there has been a diversity of institution l corresponding to the age in which they were observed. Some sacrifices were offered before the actual manifestation of that new covenant, the benefits of which are provided by the one true offering of the one Priest, namely, by the shed blood of Christ; and another sacrifice, adapted to this manifestation, and offered in the: present age by us who are called Christians after! the name of Him who has been revealed, is set= before us not only in the gospels, but also in the prophetic books. For a change, not of the God, who is worshipped, nor of the religion itself, but of sacrifices and of sacraments, would seem to be proclaimed without warrant now, if it had not been foretold in the earlier dispensation. For just as when the same man brings to God in the morning one kind of offering, and in the evening another, according to the time of day, he does not thereby change either his God or his religion, any more than he changes the nature of a salutation who uses one form of salutation in the morning and another in the evening: so, in the complete cycle of the ages, when one kind of offering is known to have been made by the ancient saints, and another is presented by the saints in our time, this only shows that these sacred mysteries are celebrated not according to human presumption, but by divine authority, in the manner best adapted to the times. There is here no change either in the Deity or in the religion.<br>
    22. QUESTION IV. Let us, in the next place, consider what he has laid down concerning the proportion between sin and punishment when, misrepresenting the gospel, he says: "Christ threatens eternal punishment to those who do not believe in Him;"' and yet He says in another place, "With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."2 "Here," he remarks, "is something sufficiently absurd and contradictory; for if He is to award punishment according to measure, and all measure is limited by the end of time, what mean these threats of eternal punishment ?"<br>
    23. It is difficult to believe that this question has been put in the form of objection by one claiming to be in any sense a philosopher; for he says, "All measure is limited by time," as if men were accustomed to no other measures than measures of time, such as hours and days and years, or such as are referred to when we say that the time of a short syllable is one-half of that of a long syllable.3 For I suppose that bushels and firkins, urns and amphorae, are not measures of time. How, then, is all measure limited by time? Do not the heathen themselves affirm that the sun is eternal ? And yet they presume to calculate and pronounce on the basis of geometrical measurements what is the proportion between it and the earth. Whether this calculation be within or beyond their power, it is certain, notwithstanding, that it has a disc of definite dimensions. For if they do ascertain how large it is, they know its dimensions, and if they do not succeed in their investigation, they do not know these; but the fact that men cannot discover them is no proof that they do not exist. It is possible, therefore, for something to be eternal, and nevertheless to have a definite<br>
<br>
421<br>
<br>
measure of its proportions. In this I have been speaking upon the assumption of their own view as to the eternal duration of the sun, in order that they may be convinced by one of their own tenets, and obliged to admit that something may be eternal and at the same time measurable. And therefore let them not think that the threatening of Christ concerning eternal punishment is not to be believed because of His also saying, "In what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you."<br>
24. For if He had said, "That which you have measured shall be measured unto you," even in that case it would not have been necessary to take the clauses as referring to something which was in all respects the same. For we may correctly say, That which you have planted you shall reap, although men plant not fruit but trees, and reap not trees but fruit. We say it, however, with reference to the kind of tree; for a man does not plant a fig:tree, and expect to gather nuts from it. In like manner it might be said, What you have done you shall suffer; not meaning that if one has committed adultery, for example, he shall suffer the same, but that what he has in that crime done to the law, the law shall do unto him, i.e. forasmuch as he has removed from his life the law which prohibits such things, the law shall requite him by removing him from that human life over which it presides.<br>
 Again, if He had said, "As much as ye shall have measured, so much shall be measured unto you," even from this statement it would not necessarily follow that we must understand punishments to be in every particular equal to the sins punished. Barley and wheat, for example, are not equal in quality, and yet it might be said, "As much as ye shall have measured, so much shall be measured unto you," meaning for so much wheat so much barley. Or if the matter in question were pain, it might be said, "As great pain shall be inflicted on you as you have inflicted on others;" this might mean that the pain should be in severity equal, but in time more protracted, and therefore by its continuance greater. For suppose I were to say of two lamps, "The flame of this one was as hot as the flame of the other," this would not be false, although, perchance, one of them was earlier extinguished than the other. Wherefore, if things be equally great in one respect, but not in another, the fact that they are not alike in all respects does not invalidate the statement that in one respect, as admitted, they are equally great.<br>
25. Seeing, however, that the words of Christ were these, "In what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you," and that beyond all question the measure in which anything is measured is one thing, and that which is measured in it is another, it is obviously possible that with the same measure with which men have measured, say, a bushel of wheat, there may be measured to them thousands of bushels, so that with no difference in the measure there may be all that difference in the quantity, not to speak of the difference of quality which might be in the things measured; for it is not only possible that with the same measure with which one has measured barley to others, wheat may be measured to him, but, moreover, with the same measure with which he has measured grain, gold may be 'measured to him, and of the grain there may have been one bushel, while there may be very many of the gold. Thus, although there is a difference both in kind and quantity, it may be nevertheless truly said in reference to things which are thus unlike: "In the measure in which he measured to others it is measured unto him."<br>
    The reason, moreover, why Christ uttered this saying is sufficiently plain from the immediately preceding context. "Judge not," He said, "that ye be not judged; for in the judgment in which ye judge ye shall be judged." Does this mean that if they have judged any one with injustice the)' shall themselves be unjustly judged? Of course not; for there is no unrighteousness with God. But it is thus expressed, "In the judgment in which ye judge ye shall be judged," as if it were said, In the will in which ye have dealt kindly with others ye shall be set at liberty, or in the will in which ye have done evil to others ye shall be punished. As if any one, for example, using his eyes for the gratification of base desires, were ordered to be made blind, this would be a just sentence for him to hear, "In those eyes by which thou hast sinned, in them hast thou deserved to be punished." For every one uses the judgment of his own mind, according as it is good or evil, for doing good or for doing evil. Wherefore it is not unjust that he be judged in that in which he judges, that is to say, that he suffer the penalty in the mind's faculty of judgment when he is made to endure those evils which are the consequences of the sinful judgment of his mind.<br>
    26. For while other torments which are prepared to be hereafter inflicted are visible,torments occasioned by the same central cause, namely, a depraved will,- it is also the fact that within the mind itself, in which the appetite of the will is the measure of all human actions, sin is followed immediately by punishment, which is for the most part increased in proportion to the greater blindness of one by whom it is not felt. Therefore when He had said, "With [or rather, as Augustin renders it, In] what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged," He went on to add, "And in what measure ye mete, it shall be meas-<br>
<br>
422<br>
<br>
ured unto you." A good man, that is to say, will measure out good actions in his own will, and in the same shall blessedness be measured unto him; and in like manner, a bad man will measure out bad actions in his own will, and in the same shall misery be meted out to him; for in whatsoever any one is good when his will aims at what is good, in the same he is evil when his will aims at what is evil. And therefore it is also in this that he is made to experience bliss or misery, viz. in the feeling experienced by his own will, which is the measure both of all actions and of the recompenses of actions. For we measure actions, whether good or bad, by the quality of the volitions which produce them, not by the length of time which they occupy. Were it otherwise, it would be regarded a greater crime to fell a tree than to kill a man. For the former takes a long time and many strokes, the latter may be done with one blow in a moment of time; and yet, if a man were punished with no more than transportation for life for this great crime committed in a moment, it would be said that he had been treated with more clemency than he deserved, although, in regard to the duration of time, the protracted punishment is not in any way to be compared with the sudden act of murder. Where, then, is anything contradictory in the sentence objected to, if the punishments shall be equally protracted or even alike eternal, but differing in comparative gentleness and severity? The duration is the same; the pain inflicted is different in degree, because that which constitutes the measure of the sins l themselves is found not in the length of time] which they occupy, but in the will of those who! commit them.<br>
    2 7. Certainly the will itself endures the punishment, whether pain be inflicted on the mind or on the body; so that the same thing which is ] gratified by the sin is smitten by the penalty, and so that he who judgeth without mercy is! judged without mercy; for in this sentence also the standard of measure is the same only in this point, that what he did not give to others is denied to him, and therefore the judgment passed on him shall be eternal, although the judgment pronounced by him cannot be eternal. It is therefore in the sinner's own measure that punishments which are eternal are measured out to him, though the sins thus punished were not eternal; for as his wish was to have an eternal enjoyment of sin, so the award which he finds is an eternal endurance of suffering.<br>
    The brevity which I study in this reply precludes me from collecting all, or at least as many as I could of the statements contained in our sacred books as to sin and the punishment of sin, and deducing from these one indisputable<br>
<br>
proposition on the subject; and perhaps, even if I obtained the necessary leisure, I might not possess abilities competent to the task. Nevertheless, I think that in the meantime I have proved that there is no contradiction between the eternity of punishment and the principle that sins shall be recompensed in the same measure in which men have committed them.<br>
    28. QUESTION V. The objector who has brought forward these questions from Porphyry has added this one in the next place: Will you have the goodness to instruct me as to whether Solomon said truly or not that God has no Son ?<br>
    29. The answer is brief: Solomon not only did not say this, but, on the contrary, expressly said that God hath a Son. For in one of his writings Wisdom saith: "Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was ! brought forth." And what is Christ but the Wisdom of God ? Again, in another place in the book of Proverbs, he says: "God hath taught me wisdom, and I have learned the knowledge of the holy? Who hath ascended up into heaven and descended ? who hath gathered the winds in His fists ? who hath bound the waters in a garment ? who hath established all the ends of the earth ? What is His name, and what is His Son's name ? "3 Of the two questions concluding this quotation, the one referred to the Father, namely, "What is His name ?" -- with allusion to the foregoing words, "God hath taught me wisdom," --the other evidently to the Son, since he says, "or what is His Son's name ?" -- with allusion to the other statements, which are more properly understood as pertaining to the Son, viz. "Who hath ascended up into heaven and descended ?" --a question brought to remembrance by the words of Paul: "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens; "4 i--" Who hath gathered the winds in His fists ?" [i.e. the souls of believers in a hidden and secret ]place, to whom, accordingly, it is said, "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God; "s --" Who hath bound the waters in a garment ? "6 whence it could be said, "As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ; "7 --" Who hath established all the ends of the earth?" the same who said to His disciples, "Ye shall be witnesses unto Me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." s<br>
    30. QUESTION VI. The last question proposed is concerning Jonah, and it is put as if it were<br>
<br>
423<br>
<br>
not from. Porphyry, but as being a standing subject of ridicule among the Pagans; for his words are: "In the next place, what are we to believe concerning Jonah, who is said to have been three days in a whale's belly ? The thing is utterly improbable and incredible, that a man swallowed with his clothes on should have existed in the inside of a fish. If, however, the story is figurative, be pleased to explain it. Again, what is meant by the story that a gourd sprang up above the head of Jonah after he was vomited by the fish? What was the cause of this gourd's growth ?" Questions such as these I have seen discussed by Pagans amidst loud: laughter, and with great scorn.<br>
    31. To this I reply, that either all the miracles wrought by divine power may be treated as incredible, or there is no reason why the story of this miracle should not be believed. The resurrection of Christ Himself upon the third day would not be believed by us, if the Christian<br>
faith was afraid to encounter Pagan ridicule. Since, however, our friend did not on this ground ask whether it is to be believed that Lazarus was raised on the fourth day, or that Christ rose on the third day, I am much surprised that he reckoned what was done with Jonah to be incredible; unless, perchance, he thinks it easier for a dead man to be raised in life from his sepulchre, than for a living man to be kept in life in the spacious belly of a sea monster. For without mentioning the great size of sea monsters which is reported to us by those who have knowledge of them, let me ask how many men could be contained in the belly which was fenced round with those huge ribs which are fixed in a public place in Carthage, and are well known to all men there ? Who can be at a loss to conjecture how wide an entrance must have been given by the opening of the mouth which was the gateway of that vast cavern ? unless, perchance, as our friend stated it, the clothing of Jonah stood in the way of his being swallowed without injury, as if he had required to squeeze himself through a narrow passage, instead of being, as: was the case, thrown headlong through the air, and so caught by the sea monster as to be received into its belly before he was wounded by its teeth. At the same time, the Scripture does not say whether he had his clothes on or not when he was cast down into that cavern, so that it may without contradiction be understood that he made that swift descent unclothed, if perchance it was necessary that his garment should be taken from him, as the shell is taken from an egg, to make him more easily swallowed. For men are as much concerned about the raiment of this prophet as would be reasonable if it were stated that he had crept through a very small window, or had been going into a bath; and yet, even though it were necessary in such circumstances to enter without parting with one's clothes, this would be only inconvenient, not miraculous.<br>
    32. But perhaps our objectors find it impossible to believe in regard to this divine miracle that the heated moist air of the belly, whereby food is dissolved, could be so moderated in temperature as to preserve the life of a man.<br>
. If so, with how much greater force might they pronounce it incredible that the three young men cast into the furnace by the impious king walked unharmed in the midst of the flames ! If, there:' fore, these objectors refuse to believe any narrative of a divine miracle, they must be refuted by another line of argument. For it is incumbent on them in that case not to single out some one to be objected to, and called in question as incredible, but to denounce as incredible all narratives in which miracles of the same kind or more remarkable are recorded. And yet, if this which is written concerning Jonah were said to have been done by Apuleius of Madaura or Apollonius of Tyana, by whom they boast, though unsupported by reliable testimony, that many wonders were performed (albeit even the devils do some works like those done by the holy angels, not in truth, but in appearance, not by wisdom, but manifestly by subtlety), --if, I say, any such event were narrated in connection with these men to whom they give the flattering name of magicians or philosophers, we should hear from their mouths sounds not of derision, but of triumph. Be it so, then; let them laugh at our Scriptures; let them laugh as much as they can, when they see themselves daily becoming fewer in number, while some are removed by death, and others by their embracing the Christian faith, and when all those things are being fulfilled which were predicted by the prophets who long ago laughed at them, and said that they would fight and bark against the truth in vain, and would gradually come over to our side; and who not only transmitted these statements to us, their descendants, for our learning, but promised that they should be fulfilled in our experience.<br>
33. It is neither unreasonable nor unprofitable to inquire what these miracles signify, so that, !after their significance has been explained, men ]may believe not only that they really occurred, n but also that they have been recorded, because I of their possessing symbolical meaning. Let him, therefore, who proposes to inquire why the i prophet Jonah was three days in the capacious belly of a sea monster, begin by dismissing doubts as to the fact itself; for this did actually occur, and did not occur in vain. For if figures which are expressed in words only, and not in 'actions, aid our faith, how much more should our<br>
<br>
424<br>
<br>
faith be helped by figures expressed not only in words, but also in actions ! Now men are wont to speak by words; but divine power speaks by actions as well as by words. And as words which are new or somewhat unfamiliar lend brilliancy to a human discourse when they are scattered through it in a moderate and judicious manner, so the eloquence of divine revelation receives, so to speak, additional lustre from actions which are at once marvellous in themselves and skilfully designed to impart spiritual instruction.<br>
    34. As to the question, What was prefigured by the sea monster restoring alive on the third day the prophet whom it swallowed ? why is this asked of us, when Christ Himself has given the answer, saying, "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of the prophet Jonas: for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so must the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth "' ? In regard to the three days in which the Lord Christ was under the power of death, it would take long to explain how they are reckoned to be three whole days, that is, days along with their nights, because of the whole of the first day and of the third day being understood as represented on the part of each; moreover, this has been already stated very often in other discourses. As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly of the whale, so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into' the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those who are tossed on the waves of this world. And as the command was given at first that the word of God should be preached to the Nine-rites by Jonah, but the preaching of Jonah did not come to them until after the whale had vomited him forth, so prophetic teaching was Addressed early to the Gentiles, but did not actually come to the Gentiles until after the resurrection of Christ from the grave.<br>
    35. In the next place, as to Jonah's building for himself a booth, and sitting down over against Nineveh, waiting to see what would befall the city, the prophet was here in his own person the symbol of another fact. He prefigured the carnal people of Israel. For he also was grieved at the salvation of the Ninevites, that is, at the redemption and deliverance of the Gentiles, from among whom Christ came to call, not righteous men, but sinners to repentance.' Wherefore the shadow of that gourd over his head prefigured the promises of the Old Testament, or rather the privileges already enjoyed in it, in which there was, as the apostle says, "a shadow of things to come," s furnishing, as it were, a refuge from the heat of temporal calamities in the land of promise. Moreover, in that morning-worm? which by its gnawing tooth made the gourd wither away, Christ Himself is again prefigured, forasmuch as, by the publication of the gospel from His mouth, all those things which flourished among the Israelites for a time, or with a shadowy. symbolical meaning in that earlier dispensation, are now deprived of their significance, and have withered away. And now that nation, having lost the kingdom, the priesthood, and the sacrifices formerly established in Jerusalem, all which privileges were a shadow of things to come, is burned with grievous heat of tribulation in its condition of dispersion and captivity, as Jonah was, according to the history, scorched with the heat of the sun, and is overwhelmed with sorrow; and notwithstanding, the salvation of the Gentiles and of the penitent is of more importance in the sight of God than this sorrow of Israel and the "shadow" of which the Jewish nation was so glad.<br>
    36. Again, let the Pagans laugh, and let them treat with proud and senseless ridicule Christ the Worm and this interpretation of the prophetic symbol, provided that He gradually and surely, nevertheless, consume them. For concerning all such Isaiah prophesies, when by him God says to us, "Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings: for the moth shall eat them up as a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for ever." s Let us therefore acknowledge Christ to be the morning-worm, because, moreover, in that psalm which bears the title, "Upon the hind of the morning," 6 He has been pleased to call Himself by this very name: "I am," He says, "a worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people." This reproach is one of those reproaches which we are commanded not to fear in the words of Isaiah, "Fear ye not the reproach of men." By that Worm, as by a moth, they are being consumed who under the tooth of His gospel are made to wonder daily at the diminution of their numbers, which is caused by desertion from their party. Let us therefore acknowledge this symbol of Christ; and because of the salvation of God, let us bear patiently the reproaches of men. He is a Worm because of the lowliness of the flesh which He assumed--perhaps, also, because of His being born of a virgin; for the worm is generally not begotten, but spontaneously origi-<br>
<br>
425<br>
<br>
nated in flesh or any vegetable product [sine concubitu nascitur]. He is the morning-worm, because He rose from the grave before the dawn of day. That gourd might, of course, have withered without any worm at its root; and finally, if God regarded the worm as necessary for this work, what need was there to add the epithet morning-worm, if not to secure that He should be recognised as the Worm who in the psalm, "pro susceptione matutina," sings, "I am a worm, and no man"?<br>
    37. What, then, could be more palpable than the fulfilment of this prophecy in the accomplishment of the things foretold? That Worm was indeed despised when He hung upon the cross, as is written in the same psalm: "They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him; let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him; ", and again, when this was fulfilled which the psalm foretold, "They pierced my hands and my feet. They have told all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture circumstances which are in that ancient book described when future by the prophet with as great plainness as they are now recorded in the gospel history after their occurrence. But if in His humiliation that Worm was despised, is He to be still despised when we behold the accomplishment of those things which are predicted in the latter part of the same psalm: "All the ends of the world shall remember, and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship in His presence. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and He shall govern among the nations"?s Thus the Ninevites "remembered, and turned unto the Lord." The salvation granted to the Gentiles on their repentance, which was thus so long before prefigured, Israel then, as represented by Jonah, regarded with grief, as now their nation grieves, bereft of their shadow, and vexed with the heat of their tribulations. Any one is at liberty to open up with a different interpretation, if only it be in harmony with the rule of faith, all the other particulars which are hidden in the symbolical history of the prophet Jonah; but it is obvious that it is not lawful to interpret the three days which he passed in the belly of the whale otherwise than as it has been revealed by the heavenly Master Himself in the gospel, as quoted above.<br>
    38. I have answered to the best of my power the questions proposed; but let him who proposed them become now a Christian at once, lest, if he delay until he has finished the discussion of all difficulties connected with the sacred books, he come to the end of this life before he pass from death to life. For it is reasonable that he inquire as to the resurrection of the dead before he is admitted to the Christian sacraments. Perhaps he ought also to be allowed to insist on preliminary discussion of the question proposed concerning Christ--why He came so late in the world's history, and of a few great questions besides, to which all others are subordinate. But to think of finishing all such questions as those concerning the words, "In what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you," and concerning Jonah, before he becomes a Christian, is to betray great unmindfulness of man's limited capacities, and of the shortness of the life which remains to him. For there are innumerable questions the solution of which is not to be demanded before we believe, lest life be finished by us in unbelief. When, however, the Christian faith has been thoroughly received, these questions behove to be studied with the utmost diligence for the pious satisfaction of the minds of believers. Whatever is discovered by such study ought to be imparted to others without vain self-complacency; if anything still remain hidden, we must bear with patience an . imperfection of knowledge which is not prejudicial to salvation.<br>

<br>
	TO MY LORD AND BROTHER, AUGUSTIN, RIGHTLY AND JUSTLY WORTHY OF ESTEEM AND OF ALL POSSIBLE HONOUR, NECTARIUS SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. In reading the letter of your Excellency, in which you have overthrown the worship of idols and the ritual of their temples? I seemed to myself to hear the voice of a philosopher,not of such a philosopher as the academician of whom they say, that having neither new doctrine to propound nor earlier statements of his own to defend, he was wont to sit in gloomy corners on the ground absorbed in some deep reverie, with his knees drawn back to his forehead, and his head buried between them, contriving how he might as a detractor assail the discoveries or cavil at the statements by which others had earned renown; nay, the form which rose under the spell of your eloquence and stood before my eyes was rather that of the great statesman Cicero, who, having been crowned with laurels for saving the lives of many of his countrymen, carried the trophies won in his forensic victories into the wondering schools of Greek philosophy, when, as one pausing for<br>
<br>
426<br>
<br>
breath, he laid down the trumpet of sonorous voice and language which he had blown with blast of just indignation against those who had broken the laws and conspired against the life of the republic, and, adopting the fashion of the Grecian mantle, unfastened and threw back over his shoulders the toga's ample folds.<br>
    2. I therefore listened with pleasure when you urged us to the worship and religion of the only supreme God; and when you counselled us to look to our heavenly fatherland, I received the exhortation with joy. For you were obviously speaking to me not of any city confined by encircling ramparts, nor of that commonwealth on] this earth which the writings of philosophers have mentioned and declared to have all mankind as its citizens, but of that City which is inhabited and possessed by the great God, and by the spirits which have earned this recompense from Him, to which, by diverse roads and! pathways, all religions aspire,- the City which we are not able in language to describe, bull which perhaps we might by thinking apprehend. But while this City ought therefore to be, above all others, desired and loved, I am nevertheless of opinion that we are bound not to prove un-. faithful to our own native land, -- the land which first imparted to us the enjoyment of the light'. of day, in which we were nursed and educated, and (to pass to what is specially relevant in this case) the land by rendering services to which men obtain a home prepared for them in heaven after the death of the body; for, in the opinion of the most learned, promotion to that celestial City is granted to those men who have deserved well of the cities which gave them birth, and a higher experience of fellowship with God is the portion of those who are proved to have contributed by their counsels or by their labours to the welfare of their native land.<br>
    As to the remark which you were pleased wittily to make regarding our town, that it has been made conspicuous not so much by the achievements of warriors as by the conflagrations of incendiaries, and that it has produced thorns rather than flowers, this is not the severest reproof that might have been given, for we know that flowers are for the most part borne on thorny bushes. For who does not know that even roses grow on briars, and that in the bearded heads of grain the ears are guarded by spikes, and that, in general, pleasant and painful things are found blended together ?<br>
    3. The last statement in your Excellency's letter was, that neither capital punishment nor bloodshed is demanded in order to compensate for the wrong done to the Church, but that the offenders must be deprived of the possessions which they most fear to lose. But in my deliberate judgment, though, of course, I may be mistaken, it is a more grievous thing to be deprived of one's property than to be deprived of life. For, as you know, it is an observation frequently recurring in the whole range of literature, that death terminates the experience of all evils, but that a life of indigence only confers upon us an eternity of wretchedness; for it is worse to live miserably than to put an end to our miseries by death. This fact, also, is declared by the whole nature and method of your work, in which you support the poor, minister healing to the diseased, and apply remedies to the bodies of those who are in pain, and, in short, make it your business to prevent the afflicted from feeling the protracted continuance of their sufferings.<br>
    Again, as to the degree of demerit in the faults of some as compared with others, it is of no importance what the quality of the fault may seem to be in a case in which forgiveness is craved. For, in the first place, if penitence procures forgiveness and expiates the crime-and surely he is penitent who begs pardon and humbly embraces the feet of the party whom he has offended -- and if, moreover, as is the opinion of some philosophers, all faults are alike, pardon ought to be bestowed upon all without distinction. One of our citizens may have spoken somewhat rudely: this was a fault; another may have perpetrated an insult or an injury: this was equally a fault; another may have violently taken what was not his own: this is reckoned a crime; another may have attacked buildings devoted to secular or to sacred purposes: he ought not to be for this crime placed beyond the reach of pardon. Finally, there would be no occasion for pardon if there were no foregoing faults.<br>
    4. Having now replied to your letter, not as the letter deserved, but to the best of my ability, such as it is, I beg and implore you (oh that I were in your presence, that you might also see my tears !) to consider again .and again who you are, what is your professed character, and what is the business to which your life is devoted. Reflect upon the appearance presented by a town from which men doomed to torture are dragged forth; think of the lamentations of mothers and wives, of sons and of fathers; think of the shame felt by those who may return, set at liberty indeed, but having undergone the torture; think what sorrow and groaning the sight of their wounds and scars must renew. And when you have pondered all these things, first think of God, and think of your good name among men; or rather think of what friendly charity and the bonds of common humanity require at your hands, and seek to be praised not by punishing but by pardoning the offenders. And such things may indeed be said regarding ),our treatment of those whom actual guilt con-<br>
<br>
427<br>
<br>
demns on their own confession: to these persons you have, out of regard to your religion, granted pardon; and for this I shall always praise you.. But now it is scarcely possible to express the greatness of that cruelty which pursues the innocent, and summons those to stand trial on a capital charge of whom it is certain that they had no share in the crimes alleged. If it so happen that they are acquitted, consider, I beseech you, with what ill-will their acquittal must be regarded by their accusers who of their own accord dismissed the guilty from the bar, but let the innocent go only when they were defeated in their attempts against them.<br>
    May the supreme God be your keeper, and preserve you as a bulwark of His religion and an ornament to our country.<br>
<br>
                        LETTER CIV. (A.D. 409.)<br>
	TO NECTARIUS, MY NOBLE LORD AND BROTHER, JUSTLY WORTHY OF ALL HONOUR AND ESTEEM AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    CHAP. 1.--1. I have read the letter which you kindly sent in answer to mine. Your reply comes at a very long interval after the time when I despatched my letter to you. For I had written an answer to you' when my holy brother and colleague Possidius was still with us, before he had entered on his voyage; but the letter which you have been pleased to entrust to him for me I received on March 27th, about eight months after I had written to you. The reason why my communication was so late in reaching you, or yours so late in being sent to me, I do not know. Perhaps your prudence has only now dictated the reply which your pride formerly disdained. ' If this be the explanation, I wonder what has occasioned the change. Have you perchance heard some report, which is as yet unknown to us, that my brother Possidius had obtained authority for proceedings of greater severity against your citizens, whom --you must excuse me for saying this--he loves in a way more likely to promote their welfare than you do yourself ? For your letter shows that you apprehended something of this' kind when you charge me to set before my eyes "the appearance presented by a town from which men doomed to torture are dragged forth," and to "think of the lamentations of mothers and wives, of sons and of fathers; of the shame felt by those who may return, set at liberty indeed, but having undergone the torture; and of the sorrow and groaning which the sight of their wounds and scars must renew."2 Far be it from us to demand the infliction, either by ourselves or by any one, of such hardships upon any of our enemies! But, as I have said, ff report has brought any such measures of severity to your ears, give us a more clear and particular account of the things reported, that we may know either what to do in order to prevent these things from being done, or what 'answer we must make in order to disabuse the minds of those who believe the rumour.<br>
    2. Examine more carefully my letter, to which you have so reluctantly sent a reply, for I have in it made my views sufficiently plain; but through not remembering, as I suppose, what I had written, you have in your reply made reference to sentiments widely differing from mine, and wholly unlike them. For, as if quoting from memory what I had written, you have inserted in your letter what I never said at all in mine. You say that the concluding sentence of my letter was, "that neither capital punishment nor bloodshed is demanded in order to compensate for the wrong done to the Church, but that the offenders must be deprived of that which they most fear to lose;" and then, in showing how great a calamity this imports, you add and connect with my words that you "deliberately judge--though you may perhaps be mistaken --that it is a more grievous thing to be deprived of one's possessions than to be deprived of life." And in order to expound more clearly the kind of possessions to which you refer, you go on to say that. it must be known to me, "as an observation frequently recurring in the whole range of literature, that death terminates the experience of all evils, but that a life of indigence only confers upon us an eternity of wretchedness." From which you have drawn the conclusion that it is "worse to live miserably than to put an end to our miseries by death."<br>
    3. Now I for my part do not recollect reading anywhere- either in our [Christian] literature, to which I confess that I was later of applying my mind than I could now wish that I had been, or in your [Pagan] literature, which I studied from my childhood--that "a life of indigence only confers upon us an eternity o( wretchedness." For the poverty of the industrious is never in itself a crime; nay, it is to some extent a means of withdrawing and restraining men from sin. And therefore the circumstance that a man has lived in poverty here is no ground for apprehending that this shall procure for him after this brief life "an eternity of wretchedness ;" and in this life which we spend on earth it is utterly impossible for any misery to be eternal, seeing that this life cannot be eternal, nay, is not of long duration even in those who attain to the most advanced old age. In the writings referred to, I for my part have read, not that in this life -- as you think, and as you allege that these writ-<br>
<br>
428<br>
<br>
ings frequently affirm -- there can be an eternity of wretchedness, but rather that this life itself which we here enjoy is short. Some, indeed but not all, of your authors have said that death is the end of all evils: that is indeed the opinion of the Epicureans, and of such others as believe the soul to be mortal. But those philosophers whom Cicero designates "consulates" in a certain sense, because he attaches great weight to their authority, are of opinion that when our last hour on earth comes the soul is not annihilated, but removes from its tenement, and continues in existence for a state of blessedness or of misery, according to that which a man's actions, whether good or bad, claim as their due recompense. This agrees with the teaching of our sacred writings, with which I wish that I were more fully conversant. Death is therefore the end of all evils- but only in the case of those whose life is, pure, religious, upright, and blameless; not in the case of those who, inflamed with passionate desire for the trifles and vanities of time, are proved to be miserable by the utter perversion of their desires, though meanwhile they esteem themselves happy, and are after death compelled not only to accept as their lot, but to realize in their experience far greater miseries.<br>
    4. These sentiments, therefore, being frequently expressed both in some of your own authors, whom you deem worthy of greater esteem, and in all our Scriptures, be it yours, 0 worthy lover of the country which is on earth your fatherland, to dread on behalf of your countrymen a life of luxurious indulgence rather than a life of indigence; or if you fear a life of indigence, warn them that the poverty which is to be more studiously shunned is that of the man who, though surrounded with abundance of worldly possessions, is, through the insatiable eagerness wherewith he covets these, kept always in a state of want, which, to use the words of your own authors, neither plenty nor scarcity can relieve. In the letter, however, to which you reply, I did not say that those of your citizens who are enemies to the Church were to be corrected by being reduced to that extremity of indigence in which the necessaries of life are wanting, and to which succour is brought by that compassion of which you have thought it incumbent on you to point out to me that it is professed by us in the whole plan of those labours wherein we "support the poor, minister healing to the diseased, and apply remedies to the bodies of those who are in pain;" albeit, even such extremity of want as this would be more profitable than abundance of all things, if abused to the gratification of evil passions. But far be it from me to think that those about whom we are treating should be reduced to such destitution by the measures of coercion proposed.<br>
<br>
    CHAP. n.--5. Though you did not consider it worth while to read my letter over when it was to be answered, perhaps you have at least so far esteemed it as to preserve it, in order to its being brought to you when you at any time might desire it and call for it; if this be the case, look over it again, and mark carefully my words: you will assuredly find in it one thing to which, in my opinion, you must admit that you have made no reply. For in that letter occur the words which I now quote: "We do not desire to gratify our anger by vindictive retribution for the past, but we are concerned to make provision in a truly merciful spirit for the future. Now wicked men have something in respect to which they may be punished, and that by Christians, in a merciful way, and so as to promote their own profit and well-being. For they have these three things -- life and health of the body, the means of supporting that life, and the means and opportunities of living a wicked life. Let the two former remain untouched in the possession of those who repent of their crime; this we desire, and this we spare no pains to secure. But as to the third, if it please God to deal with it as a decaying or diseased part, which must be removed with the pruning-knife, He will in such punishment prove the greatness of his compassion." If you had read over these words of mine again, when you were pleased to write your reply, you would have looked upon it rather as an unkind insinuation than as a necessary duty to address to me a petition not only for deliverance from death, but also for exemption from torture, on behalf of those regarding whom I said that we wished to leave unimpaired their possession of bodily life and health. Neither was there any ground for your apprehending our inflicting a life of indigence and of dependence upon others for daily bread on those regarding whom I had said that we desired to secure to them the second of the possessions named above, viz. the means of supporting life. But as to their third possession, viz. the means and opportunities of living wickedly, that is to say- passing over other things -- their silver with which they constructed those images of their false gods, in whose protection or adoration or unhallowed worship an attempt was made even to destroy the church of God by fire, and the provision made for relieving the poverty of very pious persons was given up to become the spoil of a wretched mob, and blood was freely shed -- why, I ask, does your patriotic heart dread the stroke which shall cut this away, in order to prevent a fatal boldness from being in everything fostered and confirmed by impunity? This I beg you to discuss fully, and to show me in well-considered<br>
429<br>
<br>
arguments what wrong there is in this; mark carefully what I say, lest under the form of a petition in regard to what I am saying you appear to bring against us an indirect accusation.<br>
    6. Let your countrymen be well reported of for their virtuous manners, not for their superfluous wealth; we do not wish them to be reduced through coercive measures on our account to the plough of Quintius [Cincinnatus], or to the hearth of Fabricius. Yet by such extreme poverty these statesmen of the Roman republic not only did not incur the contempt of their fellow-citizens, but were on that very account peculiarly dear to them, and esteemed the more qualified to administer the resources of their country. We neither desire nor endeavour to reduce the estates of your rich men, so that in their possession should remain no more than ten pounds of silver, as was the case with Ruffinus, who twice held the consulship, which amount the stern censorship of that time laudably required to be still further reduced as culpably large. So much are we influenced by the prevailing sentiments of a degenerate age in dealing more tenderly with minds that are very feeble, that to Christian clemency the measure which seemed just to the censors of that time appears unduly Severe; yet you see how great is the. difference between the two cases, the question being in the one, whether the mere fact of possessing ten pounds of silver should be dealt with as a punishable crime, and in the other, whether any one, after committing other very great crimes, should be permitted to retain the sum aforesaid in his possession; we only ask that what in those days was itself a crime be in our' days made the punishment of crime. There is, however, one thing which can be done, and ought to be done, in order that, on the one hand, severity may not be pushed even so far as I have mentioned, and that, on the other, men may not, presuming on impunity, run into excess of exultation and rioting, and thus furnish to other unhappy men an example by following which they would become liable to the severest and most unheard of punishments. Let this at least be granted by you, that those who attempt with fire and sword to destroy what are necessaries t_o us be made afraid of losing those luxuries of which they have a pernicious abundance. Permit us also to confer upon our enemies this benefit, that we prevent them, by their fears about that which it would do them no harm to forfeit, from attempting to that which would bring harm to themselves. For this is to be termed prudent prevention, not punishment of crime; this is not to impose penalties, but to protect men from becoming liable to penalties.<br>
    7. When any one uses measures involving the infliction of some pain, in order to prevent an inconsiderate person from incurring the most dreadful punishments by becoming accustomed to crimes which yield him no advantage, he is like one who pulls a boy's hair in order to prevent him from provoking serpents by clapping his hands at them; in both cases, while the acting of love is vexatious to its object, no member of the body is injured, whereas safety and life are endangered by that from which the person is deterred. We confer a benefit upon others, not in every case in which we do what is requested, but when we do that which is not hurtful to our petitioners For in most cases we J serve others best by not giving, and would injure them by giving, what they desire. Hence the proverb, "Do not put a sword in a child's  hand." "Nay," says Cicero, "refuse it even to your only son. For the more we love any one, !the more are we bound to avoid entrusting to him things which are the occasion of very dangerous faults." He was referring to riches, if I am not mistaken, when he made these observations. Wherefore it is for the most part an advantage !to themselves when certain things are removed I from persons in whose keeping it is hazardous i to leave them, lest they abuse them. When surgeons see that a gangrene must be cut away or cauterized, they often, out of compassion, turn a deaf ear to many cries. If we had been indulgently forgiven by our parents and teachers in our tender years on every occasion on which, being found in a fault, we begged to be let off, which of us would not have grown up intolerable ? which of us would have learned any useful thing? Such punishments are administered by wise care, not by wanton cruelty. Do not, I beseech you, in this matter think only how to accomplish that which you are requested by your countrymen to do, but carefully consider the matter in all its bearings. If you overlook the ]past, which cannot now be undone, consider the future; wisely give heed, not to the desire, I but to the real interests of the petitioners who have applied to you. We are convicted of unfaithfulness towards those whom we profess to love, if our only care is lest, by refusing to do what they ask of us, their love towards us be diminished. And what becomes of that virtue r which even your .own literature commends, in the ruler of his country who studies not so much the wishes as the welfare of his people ?<br>
    CHAP. 3. -- 8. You say "it is of no importance what the quality of the fault may be in any case in which forgiveness is craved." In this you would state the truth if the matter in question were the punishment and not the correction of men. Far be it from a Christian heart to be carried away by the lust of revenge to inflict punishment on any one. Far be it , from a Christian, when forgiving any one his<br>
<br>
430<br>
<br>
fault, to do otherwise than either anticipate or at least promptly answer the petition of him who asks forgiveness; but let his purpose in doing this be, that he may overcome the temptation to hate the man who has offended him, and to render evil for evil, and to be inflamed with rage prompting him, if not to do an injury, at least to desire to see the infliction of the penalties appointed by law; let it not be that he may relieve himself from considering the offender's interest, exercising foresight on his behalf, and restraining him from evil actions. For it is possible, on the one hand, that, moved by more vehement hostility, one may neglect the correction of a man whom he hates bitterly, and, on the other hand, that by correction involving the infliction of some pain one may secure the improvement of another whom he dearly loves.<br>
    9. I grant that, as you write, "penitence procures forgiveness, and blots out the offence," but it is that penitence which is practised under the influence of the true religion, and which has regard to the future judgment of God; not that penitence which is for the time professed or pretended before men, not to secure the cleansing of the soul for ever from the fault, but only to deliver from present apprehension of pain the life which is so soon to perish. This is the reason why in the case of some Christians who confessed their fault, and asked forgiveness for having been involved in the guilt of that crime, -- either by their not protecting the church when in danger of being burned, or by their appropriating a portion of the property which the miscreants carried off,--we believed that the pain of repentance had borne fruit, and considered it sufficient for their correction, because in their hearts is found that faith by which they could realize what they ought to fear from the judgment of God for their sin. But how can there be any healing virtue in the repentance of those who not only fail to acknowledge, but even persist in mocking and blaspheming Him who is the fountain of forgiveness ? At the same time, towards these men we do not cherish any feeling of enmity in our hearts, which are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him whose judgment both in this life and in the life to come we dread, and in whose help we place our hope. But we think that we are even taking measures for the benefit of these men, if, seeing that they do not fear God, we inspire fear in them by doing something whereby their folly is chastened, while their real interests suffer no wrong. We thus prevent that God whom they despise from being more grievously provoked by their greater crimes, to which they would be emboldened by a disastrous assurance of impunity, and we prevent their assurance of impunity from being set' forth with even more mischievous effect as an encouragement to others to imitate their example. In fine, on behalf of those for whom you make intercession to us, we intercede before God, beseeching Him to turn them to Himself, and to teach them the exercise of genuine and salutary repentance, purifying their hearts by faith.<br>
    10. Behold, then, how we love those men against whom you suppose us to be full of anger, -- loving them, you must permit me to say, with a love more prudent and profitable than you yourself cherish towards them; for we plead on their behalf that they may escape much greater afflictions, and obtain much greater blessings. If you also loved these men, not in the mere earthly affections of men, but with that love which is the heavenly gift of God, and if you were sincere in writing to me that you gave ear with pleasure to me when I was recommending :to you the worship and religion of the Supreme God, you would not only wish for your countrymen the blessings which we seek on their behalf, but you would yourself by your example lead them to their possession. Thus would the whole business of your interceding with us be concluded with abundant and most reasonable joy. Thus would your title to that heavenly fatherland, in regard to which you say that you welcomed my counsel that you should fix your eye upon it, be earned by a true and pious exercise of your love for the country which gave you birth, when seeking to make sure to your fellow-citizens, not the vain dream of temporal happiness, nor a most perilous exemption from the due punishment of their faults, but the gracious gift of eternal blessedness.<br>
   11. You have here a frank avowal of the thoughts and desires of my heart in this matter. As to what lies concealed in the counsels of God, I confess it is unknown to me; I am but a man; but whatever it be, His counsel stands most sure, and incomparably excels in equity and in wisdom all that can be conceived by the minds of men. With truth is it said in our books, "There are many devices in a man's heart; but the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand."' Wherefore, as to what time may bring forth, as to what may arise to simplify or complicate our procedure, in short, as to what desire may suddenly be awakened by the fear of losing or the hope of retaining present possessions; whether God shall show Himself so displeased by what they have done that they shall be punished with the more weighty and severe sentence of a disastrous impunity, or shall appoint that they shall be compassionately corrected in the manner which we propose, or shall avert whatever terrible doom was being prepared for them, and convert it into<br>
<br>
431<br>
<br>
joy by some more stern but more salutary correction, leading to their turning unfeignedly to seek mercy not from men but from Himself, m all this He knoweth; we know not. Why, then, should your Excellency and I be spending toil in vain over this matter before the time? Let us for a little while lay aside a care the hour of which has not yet come, and, if you please, let us occupy ourselves with that which is always pressing. For there is no time at which it is not both suitable and necessary for us to consider in what way we can please God; because! for a man to attain completely in this life to such perfection that no sin whatever shall remain in him is either impossible or (if perchance I any attain to it) extremely difficult: wherefore without delay we ought to flee at once to the] grace of Him to whom we may address with perfect truth the words which were addressed to some illustrious man by a poet, who declared that he had borrowed the lines from a Cumaean oracle, or ode of prophetic inspiration: "With thee as our leader, the obliteration of all remaining traces of our sin shall deliver the earth from perpetual alarm."1 For with Him as our leader, all sins are blotted out and forgiven; and by His way we are brought to that heavenly fatherland, the thought of which as a dwelling-place pleased you greatly when I was to the utmost of my power commending it to your affection and desire.<br>
    CHAP. IV. -- 12. But since you said that all religions by diverse roads and pathways aspire to that one dwelling-place, I fear lest, perchance, while supposing that the way in which you are now found tends thither, you should be somewhat reluctant to embrace the way which alone leads men to heaven. Observing, however, more carefully the word which you used, I think that it is not presumptuous for me to expound its meaning somewhat differently; for you did not! say that all religions by diverse roads and pathways reach heaven, or reveal, or find, or enter,' or secure that blessed land, but by saying in a, phrase deliberately weighed and chosen that all: religions aspire to it, you have indicated, not the: fruition, but the desire of heaven as common to all religions. You have in these words neither shut out the one religion which is true, nor admitted other religions which are false; for certainly the way which brings us to the goal aspires thitherward, but not every way which aspires thitherward brings us to the place .wherein all who are brought thither are unquestionably blest. Now we all wish, that is, we aspire, to be blest; but we cannot all achieve what we wish, that is, we do not all obtain what we aspire to. That man, therefore, obtains heaven who walks in the way which not only aspires thitherward, but actually brings him thither, separating himself from others who keep to the ways which aspire heavenward without finally reaching heaven. For there would be no wandering if men were content to aspire to nothing, or if the truth which men aspire to were obtained. If, however, in using the expression "diverse ways," you meant me not to understand contrary ways, but different ways, in the sense in which we speak of diverse precepts, which all tend to build up a holy life, -- one enjoining chastity, another patience or faith or mercy, and the like, -- in roads and pathways which are only in this sense diverse, that country is not only aspired unto but actually found. For in Holy Scripture we read both of ways and of a way, --of ways, e.g. in the words, "I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto Thee ;-2 of a way, e.g. in the prayer, "Teach me Thy way, O Lord; I will walk in Thy truth."3 Those ways and this way are not different; but in one way are comprehended all those of which in another place the Holy Scripture saith, "All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth."4 The careful study of these ways furnishes theme for a long discourse, and for most delightful meditation; but this I shall defer to another time if it be required.<br>
    13. In the meantime, however, -- and this, I think, may suffice in the present reply to your Excellency, -- seeing that Christ has said, "I am the way," s it is in Him that mercy and truth are to be sought: if we seek these in any other way, we must go astray, following a path which aspires to the true goal, but does not lead men thither. For example, if we resolved to follow the way indicated in the maxim which you mentioned, "All sins are alike," 6 would it not lead us into hopeless exile from that fatherland of truth and blessedness ? For could anything more absurd and senseless be said, than that the man who has laughed too rudely, and the man who has furiously set his city on fire, should be judged as having committed equal crimes ? This opinion, which is not one of many diverse ways leading to the heavenly dwelling-place, but a perverse way leading inevitably to most fatal error, you have judged it necessary to quote from certain philosophers, not because you concurred in the sentiment, but because it might help your plea for your fellow-citizens--that we might forgive those whose rage set our church in flames on the same terms as we would forgive those who may have assailed us with some insolent reproach.<br>
    14. But reconsider with me the reasoning by which you supported your position. You say,<br>
<br>
432<br>
<br>
"If, as is the opinion of some philosophers, all faults are alike, pardon ought to be bestowed upon all without distinction." Thereafter, labouring apparently to prove that all faults are alike, you go on to say, "One of our citizens may have spoken somewhat rudely: this was a fault; another may have perpetrated an insult or an injury: this was equally a fault." This is not teaching truth, but advancing, without any evidence in its support, a perversion of truth. For to your statement, "this was equally a fault," we at once give direct contradiction. You demand, perhaps, proof; but I reply, What proof have you given of your statement? Are we to hear as evidence your next sentence, "Another may have violently taken away what was not his own: this is reckoned a misdemeanour "? Here you own yourself to be ashamed of the maxim which you quoted; you had not the assurance to say that this was equally a fault, but you say "it is reckoned a misdemeanour." But the question here is not whether this also is reckoned a misdemeanour, but whether this offence and the others which you mentioned are faults equal in demerit, unless, of course, they are to be pronounced equal because they are both offences; in which case the mouse and the elephant must be pronounced equal because they are both animals, and the fly and the eagle because they both have wings.<br>
    15. You go still further, and make this proposition: "Another may have attacked buildings devoted to secular or to sacred purposes: he ought not for this crime to be placed beyond the reach of pardon." In this sentence you have indeed come to the most flagrant crime of your fellow-citizens, in speaking of injury done to sacred buildings; but even you have not affirmed that this is a crime equal only to the utterance of an insolent word. You have contented yourself with asking, on behalf of those who were guilty of this, that forgiveness which is rightly asked from Christians on the ground of their overflowing compassion, not on the ground of an alleged equality of all offences. I have already quoted a sentence of Scripture, "All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth." They shall therefore find mercy if they do not hate truth. This mercy is granted, not as if it were due on the ground of the faults of all being only equal to the fault of those who have uttered rude words, but because the law of Christ claims pardon for those who are penitent, however inhuman and impious their crime may have been. I beg you, esteemed sir, not to propound these paradoxes of the Stoics as rules of conduct for your son Paradoxus, whom we wish to see grow up in piety and in prosperity, to your satisfaction. For what could be worse for himself, yea, what more dangerous for yourself, than that your ingenuous boy should imbibe an error which would make the guilt, I shall not say of parricide, but of insolence to his father, equal only to that of some rude word inconsiderately spoken to a stranger?<br>
    16. You are wise, therefore, to insist, when pleading with us for your countrymen on the compassion of Christians, not on the stern doctrines of the Stoical philosophy, which in no wise help, but much rather hinder, the cause which you have undertaken to support. For a merciful disposition, which we must have if it be possible for us to be moved either by your intercession or by their entreaties, is pronounced by the Stoics to be an unworthy weakness, and they expel it utterly from the mind of the wise man, whose perfection, in their opinion, is to be as impassive and inflexible as iron. With more reason, therefore, might it have occurred to you to quote from your own Cicero that sentence in which, praising Caesar, he says, "Of all your virtues, none is more worthy of admiration, none more graceful, than your clemency." ' How much more ought this merciful disposition to prevail in the churches which follow Him who said, "I am the way," and which learn from His word, "All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth" ! Fear not, then, that we will try to bring innocent persons to death, when in truth we do not even wish the guilty to experience the punishment which they deserve, being moved by that mercy which, joined with truth, we love in Christ. But the man who, from fear of painfully crossing the will of the guilty, spares and indulges vices which must thereby gather more strength, is less merciful than the man who, lest he should hear his little boy crying, will not take from him a dangerous knife, and is unmoved by fear of the wounds or death which he may have to bewail as the consequence of his weakness. Reserve, therefore, until the proper time the work of interceding with us for those men, in loving whom (excuse my saying so) you not only do not go beyond us, but are even hitherto refusing to follow our steps; and write rather in your reply what influences you to shun the way which we follow, and in which we beseech you to go along with us towards that fatherland above, in which we rejoice to know that you take great delight.<br>
    17. As to those who are by birth your fellow-citizens, you have said indeed that some of them, though not all, were innocent; but, as you must see if you read over again my other letter, you have not made out a defence for them. When, in answer to your remark that you wished to leave your country flourishing, I said that we had felt thorns rather than found flowers in your countrymen, you thought that I wrote in jest. As if, forsooth, in the midst of evils of such<br>
<br>
433<br>
<br>
magnitude we were in a mood for mirth. Certainly not. While the smoke was ascending from the ruins of our church consumed by fire, were we likely to joke on the subject ? Although, indeed, none in your city appeared in my opinion innocent, but those who were absent, or were sufferers, or were destitute both of strength and of authority to prevent the tumult, I nevertheless distinguished in my reply those whose guilt was greater from those who were less to blame, and stated that there was a difference between the cases of those who were moved by fear of offending powerful enemies of the Church. and of those who desired these outrages to be committed; also between those who committed them and those who instigated others to their commission; resolving, however, not to institute inquiry in regard to the instigators, because these, perhaps, could not be ascertained without recourse to the use of tortures, from which we shrink with abhorrence, as utterly inconsistent with our aims. Your friends the Stoics, who hold that all faults are alike, must, however, if they were the judges, pronounce them all equally guilty; and if to this opinion they join that inflexible sternness wherewith they disparage clemency as a vice, their sentence would necessarily be, not that all should be pardoned alike, but that all should be punished alike. Dismiss, therefore, these philosophers altogether from the position of advocates in this case, and rather desire that we may act as Christians, so that, as we desire, we may gain in Christ those whom we forgive, and may not spare them by such indulgence as would be ruinous to themselves. May God, whose ways are mercy and truth, be pleased to enrich you with true felicity !<br>

                   LETTER CXI (NOVEMBER, A.D. 409.)<br>
<br>
	TO VICTORIANUS, HIS BELOVED LORD AND MOST LONGED-FOR BROTHER AND FELLOW-PRESBYTER, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. My heart has been filled with great sorrow by your letter. You asked me to discuss certain things at great length in my reply; but such calamities as you narrate claim rather many groans and tears than prolix treatises. The whole world, indeed, is afflicted with such portentous misfortunes, that there is scarcely any place where such things as you describe are not being committed and complained of. A short time ago some brethren were massacred by the barbarians even in those deserts of Egypt in which, in order to perfect security, they had chosen places remote from all disturbance as the sites of their monasteries. I suppose, moreover, that the outrages which they have perpetrated in the regions of Italy and Gaul are known to you also; and now similar events begin to be announced to us from many provinces of Spain, which for long seemed exempt from these evils. But why go to a distance for examples ? Behold! in our own county of Hippo, which the barbarians have not yet touched, the ravages of the Donatist clergy and Circumcelliones make such havoc in our churches, that perhaps the cruelties of barbarians would be light in comparison. For what barbarian could ever have devised what these have done, viz. casting lime and vinegar into the eyes of our clergymen, besides atrociously beating and wounding every part of their bodies ? They also sometimes plunder and burn houses, rob granaries, and pour out oil and wine; and by threatening to do this to all others in the district, they compel many even to be re-baptized. Only yesterday, tidings came to me of forty-eight souls in one place having i submitted, under fear of such things, to be re!baptized.<br>
    2. These things should make us weep, but not wonder; and we ought to cry unto God that not for our merit, but according to His mercy, He i may deliver us from so great evils. For what else was to be expected by the human race, seeing that these things were so long ago foretold both by the prophets and in the Gospels? We ought not, therefore, to be so inconsistent as to believe these Scriptures when they are read by us, and to complain when they are fulfilled; rather, surely, ought even those who had refused to believe when they read or heard these things in Scripture to become believers now when they behold the word fulfilled; so that under this; great pressure, as it were, in the olive-press of the Lord our God, although there be the dregs: of unbelieving murmurs and blasphemies, there is also a steady out flowing of pure oil in the confessions and prayers of believers. For unto those men who incessantly reproach the Christian faith, impiously saying that the human race did not suffer such grievous calamities before the Christian doctrine was promulgated throughout the world, it is easy to find a reply in the Lord's own words in the gospel, "That servant which knew not his lord's will, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; but the servant which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."' What is there to excite surprise, if, in the Christian dispensation, the world, like that servant, knowing the will of the Lord, and refusing to do it, is beaten with many stripes? These men remark the rapidity with which the<br>
<br>
434<br>
<br>
gospel is proclaimed: they do not remark the perversity with which by many it is despised. But the meek and pious servants of God, who l have to bear a double portion of temporal calamities, since they suffer both at the hands of wicked men and along with them, have also consolations peculiarly their own, and the hope of the world to come; for which reason the apostle says, "The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall hereafter be revealed in us."'<br>
    3. Wherefore, my beloved, even when you meet those whose words you say you cannot bear, because they say, "If we have deserved these things for our sins, how comes it that the servants of God are cut off not less than ourselves by the sword of the barbarians, and the handmaids of God are led away into captivity ?" -- answer them humbly, truly, and piously in such words as these: However carefully we keep the way of righteousness, and yield obedience to our Lord, can we be better than those three men who were cast into the fiery furnace for keeping the law of God ? And yet, read what Azarias, one of those three, said, opening his lips in the midst of the fire: "Blessed art Thou, 0 Lord God of our fathers: Thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified .for evermore; for Thou art righteous in all the things that Thou hast done to us; yea, true are all Thy works: Thy ways are right, and all Thy judgments truth. In all the things which Thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, Thou hast executed true judgment; for according to truth and judgment didst Thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins. For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from Thee. In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed Thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as Thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us. Wherefore all that Thou hast brought upon us, and everything that Thou hast done to us, Thou hast done in true judgment. And Thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. And now we cannot open our mouths: we are become a shame and reproach to Thy servants, and to them that worship Thee. Yet deliver us not up wholly, for Thy name's sake, neither disannul Thou Thy covenant; and cause not Thy mercy to depart from us, for Thy beloved Abraham's sake, for Thy servant Isaac's sake, and for Thy holy Israel's sake, to whom Thou hast spoken, and promised that Thou wouldst multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the sea-shore. For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins."2 Here, my brother, thou mayest surely see how men such as they, men of holiness, men of courage in the midst of tribulation, -- from which, however, they were delivered, the flame itself fearing to consume them,were not silent about their sins, but confessed them, knowing that because of these sins they were deservedly and justly brought low.<br>
    4. Nay, can we be better men than Daniel himself, concerning whom God, speaking to the prince of Tyre, says by the prophet Ezekiel, "Art thou wiser than Daniel?"3 who also is placed among the three righteous men to whom alone God saith that He would grant deliverance, -- pointing, doubtless, in them to three representative righteous men, -- declaring that he would deliver only Noah, Daniel, and Job, and that they should save along with themselves neither son nor daughter, but only their own souls ? 4 Nevertheless, read also the prayer of Daniel, and see how, when in captivity, he confesses not only the sins of his people, but his own also, and acknowledges that because of these the justice of God has visited them with the punishment of captivity and with reproach. For it is thus written: "And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: and I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said: O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love Him, and to them that keep His commandments; we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from Thy precepts and from Thy judgments: neither have we hearkened unto Thy servants the prophets, which spake in Thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto Thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither Thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against Thee. O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against Thee. To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against Him; neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord, to walk in His laws which He set before us by His servants the prophets. Yea, all Israel have transgressed Thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey Thy voice; therefore the<br>
<br>
435<br>
<br>
curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against them. And He hath confirmed His words which He spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God,' that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Thy truth. Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us; for the Lord our God is righteous in all His works which He doeth; for we obeyed not His voice. And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten Thee renown as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. O Lord, according to all Thy righteousness, I beseech Thee, let Thine anger and Thy fury be turned away from Thy city Jerusalem, Thy holy mountain, because, for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. Now, therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of Thy servant, and His supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary which is desolate, for the Lord's sake. O my God, incline Thine ear, and hear; open Thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by Thy name; for we do not present our supplications before Thee for our righteousnesses, but for Thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do: defer not, for Thine own sake, O my God; for Thy city and Thy people are called by Thy name. And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people . . ."1 Observe how he spoke first of his own sins, and then of the sins of his people. And he extols the righteousness of God, and gives praise to God for this, that He visits even His saints with the rod, not unjustly, but because of their sins. If, therefore, this be the language of men who by reason of their eminent sanctity found even encompassing flames and lions harmless, what language would befit men standing on a level so low as we occupy, seeing that, whatever righteousness we may seem to practise, we are very far from being worthy of comparison with them ?<br>
    5. Lest, however, any one should think that those servants of God, whose death at the hand of barbarians you relate, ought to have been delivered from them in the same manner as the three young men were delivered from the fire, and Daniel from the lions, let such an one know that these miracles were performed in order that the kings by whom they were delivered to these punishments might believe that they worshipped the true God. For in His hidden counsel and mercy God was in this manner making provision for the salvation of these kings. It pleased Him, however, to make no such provision in the case of Antiochus the king, who cruelly put the Maccabees to death; but He punished the heart of the obdurate king with sharper severity through their most glorious sufferings. Yet read what was said by even one of them -- the sixth who suffered: "After him they brought also the sixth, who, being ready to die, said, ' Be not deceived without cause; for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us; but think not thou that takest in hand to strive against God and His law that thou shalt escape unpunished.'"2 You see how these also are wise in the exercise of humility and sincerity, confessing that they are chastened because of their sins by the Lord, of whom it is written: "Whom the Lord loveth He correcteth," 3 and "He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;"4 wherefore the Apostle says also, "If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."5<br>
    6. These things read faithfully, and proclaim faithfully; and to the utmost of your power beware, and teach others that they must beware, of murmuring against God in these trials and tribulations. You tell me that good, faithful, and holy servants of God have been cut off by the sword of the barbarians. But what matters it whether it is by sickness or by sword that they have been set free from the body ? The Lord is careful as to the character with which His servants go from this world -- not as to the mere circumstances of their departure, excepting this, that lingering weakness involves more suffering than a sudden death; and yet we read of this same protracted and dreadful weakness as the lot of that Job to whose righteousness God Himself, who cannot be deceived, bears such testimony.<br>
    7. Most calamitous, and much to be bewailed, is the captivity of chaste and holy women; but their God is not in the power of their captors, nor does He forsake those captives whom He knows indeed to be His own. For those holy men, the record of whose sufferings and confessions I have quoted from the Holy Scriptures, being held in captivity by enemies who had car-<br>
<br>
436<br>
<br>
ried them away, uttered those words, which, preserved in writing, we can read for ourselves, in order to make us understand that servants of God, even when they are in captivity, are not forsaken by their Lord. Nay, more, do we know what wonders of power and grace the almighty and merciful God may please to accomplish by means of these captive women even in the land of the barbarians? Be that as it may, cease not to intercede with groanings on their behalf before God, and to seek, so far as your power and His providence permits you, to do for them whetever can be done, and to give them whatever consolation can be given, as time and opportunity may be granted. A few years ago, a nun, a grand-daughter of Bishop Severus, was carried off by barbarians from the neighbourhood of Sitifa, and was by the marvellous mercy of God restored with great honour to her parents. For at the very time when the maiden entered the house of her barbarian captors, it became the scene of much distress through the sudden illness of its owners, all the barbarians -three brothers, if I mistake not, or more -- being attacked with most dangerous disease. Their mother observed that the maiden was dedicated to God, and believed that by her prayers her sons might be delivered from the danger of death, which was imminent. She begged her to intercede for them, promising that if they were healed she should be restored to her parents. She fasted and prayed, and straightway was heard; for, as the result showed, the event had been appointed that this might take place. They therefore, having recovered health by this unexpected favour from God, regarded her with admiration and respect, and fulfilled the promise which their mother had made.<br>
    8. Pray, therefore, to God for them, and beseech Him to enable them to say such things as the holy Azariah, whom we have mentioned, poured forth along with other expressions in his prayer and confession before God. For in the land of their captivity these women are in circumstances similar to those of the three Hebrew youths in that land in which they could not sacrifice to the Lord their God in the manner prescribed: they cannot either bring an oblation to the altar of God, or find a priest by whom their oblation may be presented to God. May God therefore grant them grace to say to Him what Azariah said in the following sentences of his prayer: "Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt-offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before Thee, and to find mercy: nevertheless, in a contrite heart and humble spirit let us be accepted. Like as in the burnt-offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs, so let our sacrifice be in Thy sight this day. And grant that we may wholly go after Thee; for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in Thee. And now we follow Thee with all our heart: we fear Thee and seek Thy face. Put us not to shame, but deal with us after Thy loving-kindness, and according to the multitude of Thy mercies. Deliver us also according to Thy marvellous works, and give glory to Thy name, O Lord; and let all them that do Thy servants hurt be ashamed: and let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken: and let them know that Thou art Lord, the only God, and glorious over the whole world."1<br>
    9. When His servants use these words, and pray fervently to God, He will stand by them, as He has been wont ever to stand by His own, and will either not permit their chaste bodies to suffer any wrong from the lust of their enemies, or if He permit this, He will not lay sin to their charge in the matter. For when the soul is not defiled by any impurity of consent to such wrong, the body also is thereby protected from all participation in the guilt; and in so far as nothing was committed or permitted by lust on the part of her who suffers, the whole blame lies with him who did the wrong, and all the violence done to the sufferer will be regarded not as implying the baseness of wanton compliance, but as a wound blamelessly endured. For such is the worth of unblemished purity in the soul, that while it remains intact, the body also retains its purity unsullied, even although by violence its members may be overpowered.<br>
    I beg your Charity to be satisfied with this letter, which is very long considering my other work (although too short to meet your wishes), and is somewhat hurriedly written, because the bearer is in haste to be gone. The Lord will furnish you with much more abundant consolation if you read attentively His holy word.<br>

    Your Holiness is well acquainted with Faventius, a tenant on the estate of the Paratian forest, He, apprehending some injury or other at the hands of the owner of that estate, took refuge in the church at Hippo, and was there, as fugitives are wont to do, waiting till he could get the matter settled through my mediation. Becoming every day, as often happens, less and<br>
<br>
437<br>
<br>
less alarmed, and in fact completely off his guard, as if his adversary had desisted from his, enmity, he was, when leaving the house of a friend after supper, suddenly carried off by one Florentinus, an officer of the Count, who used in this act of violence a band of armed men sufficient for the purpose. When this was made known to me, and as yet it was unknown by whose orders or by whose hands he had been carried off, though suspicion naturally fell on the man from whose apprehended injury he had claimed the protection of the Church, I at once communicated with the tribune who is in command of the coast-guard. He sent out soldiers, but no one could be found. But in the morning we learned in what house he had passed the night, and also that he had left it after cock-crowing, with the man who had him in custody. I sent also to the place to which it was reported that he had been removed: there the officer above-named was found, but refused to allow the presbyter whom I had sent to have even a sight of his prisoner. On the following day I sent a letter requesting that he should be allowed the privilege which the Emperor appointed in cases such as his, namely, that persons summoned to appear to be tried should in the municipal court be interrogated whether they desired to spend thirty days under adequate surveillance in the town, in order to arrange their affairs, or find funds for the expense of their trial,. my expectation being that within that period of time we might perhaps bring his matters to some amicable settlement. Already, however, he had gone farther under charge of the officer Florentinus; but my fear is, lest perchance, if he be brought before the tribunal of the magistrate,' he suffer some injustice. For although the integrity of that judge is widely famed as incorruptible, Faventius has for his adversary a man of very great wealth. To secure that money may not prevail in that court, I beg your Holiness, my beloved lord and venerable brother, to have the kindness to give the accompanying letter to the honourable magistrate, a man very much beloved by us, and to read this letter also to him; for I have not thought it necessary to write twice the same statement of the case. I trust that he will delay the hearing of the case, because I do not know whether the man is innocent or guilty. I trust also that he will not overlook the fact that the laws have been violated in his having been suddenly carried off, without being brought, as was enacted by the Emperor, before the municipal court, in order to his being asked whether he wished to accept the benefit of the delay of thirty days, so that in this way we may get the affair settled between him and his adversary.<br>

                  (ENCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING LETTER.)<br>
TO GENEROSUS, MY NOBLE AND JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED LORD, MY HONOURED AND MUCH-LOVED SON, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
    Although the praises and favourable report of your administration and your own illustrious good name always give me the greatest pleasure because of the love which we feel due to your merit and to your benevolence, on no occasion have I hitherto been burdensome to your Excellency as an intercessor requesting any favour from you, my much-loved lord and justly-honoured son. When, however, your Excellency has learned from the letters which I have sent to my venerable brother and colleague, Fortunatus, what has occurred in the town in which I serve the Church of God, your kind heart will at once perceive the necessity under which I have been constrained to trespass by this petition on your time, already fully occupied. I am perfectly assured that, cherishing towards us the feeling which, in the name of Christ, we are fully warranted to expect, you will act in this matter as becomes not only an upright, but also a Christian magistrate.<br>
<br>
                             LETTER CXVII.<br>
                              (A.D. 410.)<br>
                      FROM DIOSCORUS TO AUGUSTIN.<br>
<br>
    To you, who esteem the substance, not the style of expression, as important, any formal preamble to this letter would be not only unnecessary, but irksome. Therefore, without further preface, I beg your attention. The aged Alypius had often promised, in answer to my request, that he would, with your help, furnish a reply to a very few brief questions of mine in regard to the Dialogues of Cicero; and as he is said to be at present in Mauritania, I ask and earnestly entreat you to condescend to give, without his assistance, those answers which, even had your brother been present, it would doubtless have fallen to you to furnish. What I require is not money, it is not gold; though, if you possessed these, you would, I am sure, be willing to give them to me for any fit object. This request of mine you can grant without effort, by merely speaking. I might importune you at a greater length, and through many of your dear friends; but I know your disposition, that you do not desire to be solicited, but show kindness readily to all, if only there be nothing improper in the thing requested: and there is absolutely nothing improper in what I ask. Be this, however, as it may, I beg you to do me this kindness, for I am on the point of embarking on a voyage. You know how very<br>
<br>
438<br>
<br>
painful it is to me to be burdensome to any one, and much more to one of your frank disposition; but God alone knows how irresistible is the pressure of the necessity under which I have made this application. For, taking leave of you, and committing myself to divine protection, I am about to undertake a voyage; and you know the ways of men, how prone they are to censure, and you see how any one will be regarded as illiterate and stupid who, when questions are addressed to him, can return no answer. Therefore, I implore you, answer all my queries without delay. Send me not away downcast. I ask this that so I may see my parents; for on this one errand I have sent Cerdo to you, and I now delay only till he return. My brother Zenobius has been appointed imperial remembrancer,1 and has sent me a free pass for my journey, with provisions. If I am not worthy of your reply, let at least the fear of my forfeiting these provisions by delay move you to give answers to my little questions.2<br>
May the most high God spare you long to us in health !Papas salutes your excellency most cordially.<br>
<br>
                      LETTER CXVIII. (A.D. 410.)<br>
                        AUGUSTIN TO DIOSCORUS.<br>
<br>
    CHAP. I.--I. YOU have sent suddenly upon me a countless multitude of questions, by which you must have purposed to blockade me on every side, or rather bury me completely, even if you were under the impression that I was otherwise unoccupied and at leisure; for how could I, even though wholly at leisure, furnish the solution of so many questions to one in such haste as you are, and, in fact, as you write, on the eve of a journey ? I would, indeed, be prevented by the mere number of the questions to be resolved, even if their solution were easy. But they are so perplexingly intricate, and so hard, that even if they were few in number, and engaging me when otherwise wholly at leisure, they would, by the mere time required, exhaust my powers of application, and wear out my strength. I would, however, fain snatch you forcibly away from the midst of those inquiries in which you so much delight, and fix you down among the cares which engage my attention, in order that you may either learn not to be unprofitably curious, or desist from presuming to impose the task of feeding and fostering your curiosity upon men among whose cares one of the greatest is to repress and curb those who are too inquisitive. For if time and pains are devoted to writing anything to you, how much better and more profitably are these employed in endeavours to cut off those vain and treacherous passions (which are to be guarded against with a caution proportioned to the ease with which they impose upon us, by their being disguised and cloaked under the semblance of virtue and the name of liberal studies), rather than in causing them to be, by our sen,ice, or rather obsequiousness, so to speak, roused to a more vehement assertion of the despotism under which they so oppress your excellent spirit.<br>
    2. For tell me what good purpose is served by the many Dialogues which you have read, if they have in no way helped you towards the discovery and attainment of the end of all your actions? For by your letter you indicate plainly enough what you have proposed to yourself as the end to be attained by all this most ardent study of yours, which is at once useless to yourself and troublesome to me. For when you were in your letter using every means to persuade me to answer the questions which you sent, you wrote these words: "I might importune you at greater length, and through many of your dear friends; but I know your disposition, that you do not desire to be solicited, but show kindness readily to all, if only there be nothing improper in the thing requested: and there is absolutely nothing improper in what I ask. Be this, however, as it may, I beg you to do me this kindness, for I am on the point of embarking on a voyage." In these words of your letter you are indeed right in your opinion as to myself, that I am desirous .of showing kindness to all, if only there be nothing improper in the request made; but it is not my opinion that there is nothing improper in what you ask. For when I consider how a bishop is distracted and overwrought by the cares of his office clamouring on every side, it does not seem to me proper for him suddenly, as if deaf, to withdraw himself from all these, and devote himself to the work of expounding to a single student some unimportant questions in the Dialogues of Cicero. The impropriety of this you yourself apprehend, although, carried away with zeal in the pursuit of your studies, you will by no means give heed to it. For what other construction can I put on the fact that, after saying that in this matter there is absolutely !nothing improper, you have immediately subjoined: "Be this, however, as it may, I beg you to do me this kindness, for I am on the point of embarking on a voyage "? For this intimates !that in your view, at least, there is no impropriety in your request, but that whatever impro-<br>
<br>
439<br>
<br>
priety may be in it, you nevertheless ask me to  do what you ask, because you are about to go on  a voyage. Now what is the force of this supplementary plea--"I am on the point of embarking on a voyage "? Do you mean that, unless you were in these circumstances, I ought not to do you service in which anything improper may be involved ? You think, forsooth, that the impropriety can be washed away by salt water. But even were it so, my share at least of the fault would remain unexpiated, because I do not propose undertaking a voyage.'<br>
  3. You write, further, that I know how very painful it is to you to be burdensome to any one, and you solemnly protest that God alone knows how irresistible is the necessity under which you make the application. When I came to this statement in your letter, I turned my attention eagerly to learn the nature of the necessity; and, behold, you bring it before me in these words: "You know the ways of men, how prone they are to censure, and how any one will be regarded as illiterate and stupid who, when questions are addressed to him, can return no answer." On reading this sentence, I felt a burning desire to reply to your letter; for, by the morbid weakness of mind which this indicated, you pierced my inmost heart, and forced your way into the midst of my cares, so that I could not refuse to minister to your relief, so far as God might enable me--not by devising a solution of your difficulties, but by breaking the connection between your happiness and the wretched support on which it now insecurely hangs, viz. the opinions of men, and fastening it to a hold which is firm and immovable. Do you not, O Dioscorus, remember an ingenious line of your favourite Persius, in which he not only rebukes your folly, but administers to your boyish head, if you have only sense to feel it, a deserved correction, restraining your vanity with the words, "To know is nothing in your eyes unless another knows that you know" ?' You have, as I said before, read so many Dialogues, and devoted your attention to so many discussions of philosophers--tell me which of them has placed the chief end of his actions in the applause of the vulgar, or in the opinion even of good and wise men ? But you,--and what should make you the more ashamed, -- you, when on the eve of sailing away from Africa, give evidence of your having made signal progress, forsooth, in your studies here, when you affirm that the only reason why you impose the task of expounding Cicero to you upon bishops, who are already oppressed with work and engrossed with matters of a very different nature, is, that you fear that if, whoa questioned by men prone to censure, you cannot answer, you will be regarded by them as illiterate and stupid. O cause well worthy to occupy the hours which bishops devote to study while other men sleep !<br>
    4. You seem to me to be prompted to mental effort night and day by no other motive than ambition to be praised by men for your industry and acquisitions in learning. Although I have ever regarded this as fraught with danger to persons who are striving after the true and the right, I am now, by your case, more convinced of the danger than before. For it is due to no [other cause than this same pernicious habit that you have failed to see by what motive we might be induced to grant to you what you asked; for as by a perverted judgment you yourself are urged on to acquire a knowledge of the things about which you put questions, from no other motive than that you may receive praise or escape censure from men, you imagine that we, by a like perversity of judgment, are to be influenced by the considerations alleged in your request. Would that, when we declare to you that by your writing such things concerning yourself we are moved, not to grant your request, but to reprove and correct you, we might be able to effect for you also complete emancipation from the influence of a boon so worthless and deceitful as the applause of men ! "It is the manner of men," you say, "to be prone to censure." What then ? "Any one who can make no reply when questions are addressed to him," you say, "will be regarded as illiterate and stupid." Behold, then, I ask you a question not concerning something in the books of Cicero, whose meaning, perchance, his readers may not be able to find, but concerning your own letter and the meaning of your own words. My question is: Why did you not say, "Any one who can make no reply will be proved to be illiterate and stupid," but prefer to say, "He will be regarded as illiterate and stupid "? Why, if not for this reason, that you yourself already understand well enough that the person who fails to answer such questions is not in reality, but only in the opinion of some, illiterate and stupid ? But I warn you that he who fears to be subjected to the edge of the pruning-hook by the tongues of such men is a sapless log, and is therefore not only regarded as illiterate and stupid, but is actually such, and proved to be so.<br>
    5. Perhaps you will say, "But seeing that I am not stupid, and that I am specially earnest in striving not to be stupid, I am reluctant even to be regarded as stupid." And rightly so; but I ask, What is your motive in this reluctance ? For in stating why you did not hesitate to burden us with those questions which you wish to have solved and explained, you said that this was the reason, and that this was the end, and an end so<br>
<br>
440<br>
<br>
necessary in your estimation that you said it was of overwhelming urgency, -- lest, forsooth, if you were posed with these questions and gave no answer, you should be regarded as illiterate and stupid by men prone to censure. Now, I ask, is this [jealousy as to your own reputation'] the whole reason why you beg this from us, or is it because of some ulterior object that you are unwilling to be thought illiterate and stupid ? If this be the whole reason, you see, as I think, that this one thing [the praise of mend is the end pursued by that vehement zeal of yours, by which, as you admit, a burden is imposed on us. But, from Dioscorus, what can be to us a burden, except that burden which Dioscorus himself unconsciously bears, -- a burden which he will begin to feel only when he attempts to rise, --a burden of which I would fain believe that it is not so bound to him as to defy his efforts to shake his shoulders free? And this I say not because these questions engage your studies, but because they are studied by you for such an end. For surely you by this time feel that this end is trivial, unsubstantial, and light as air. It is also apt to produce in the soul what may be likened to a dangerous swelling, beneath which lurk the germs of decay, and by it the eye of the mind becomes suffused, so that it cannot discern the riches of truth. Believe this, my Dioscorus, it is true: so shall I enjoy thee in unfeigned longing for truth, and in that essential dignity of truth by the shadow of which you are turned aside. If I have failed to convince you of this by the method which I have now used, I know no other that I can use. For you do not see it; nor can you possibly see it so long as you build your joys on the crumbling foundation of human applause.<br>
    6. If, however, this be not the end aimed at in these actions and by this zeal of yours, but there is some other ulterior reason for your unwillingness to be regarded as illiterate and stupid, I ask what that reason is. If it be to remove impediments to the acquisition of temporal riches, or the obtaining of a wife, or the grasping of honours, and other things of that kind which are flowing past with a headlong current, and dragging to the bottom those who fall into them, it is assuredly not our duty to help you towards that end, nay, rather we ought to turn you away from it. For we do not so forbid your fixing the aim of your studies in the precarious possession of renown as to make you leave, as it were, the waters of the Mincius and enter the Eridanus, into which, perchance, the Mincius would carry you even without yourself making the change. For when the vanity of human applause has failed to satisfy the soul, because it furnishes for its nourishment nothing real and substantial, this same eager desire compels the mind to go on to something else as more rich and productive; and if, nevertheless, this also belong to the things which pass away with time, it is as when one river leads us into another, so that there can be no rest from our miseries so long as the end aimed at in our discharge of duty is placed in that which is unstable. We desire, therefore, that in some firm and immutable good you should fix the home of your most stedfast efforts, and the perfectly secure resting-place of all your good and honourable activity. Is it, perchance, your intention, if you succeed by the breath of propitious fame, or even by spreading 'our sails for its fitful gusts, in reaching that earthly happiness of which I have spoken, to make it subservient to the acquisition of the other--the sure and true and satisfying good? But to me it does not seem probable -- and truth itself forbids the supposition -- that it should be reached either by such a circuitous way when it is at hand, or at such cost when it is freely given.<br>
    7. Perhaps you think that we ought to turn the praise of men itself to good account as an instrument for making others accessible to counsels regarding that which is good and useful; and perhaps you are anxious lest, if men regard you as illiterate and stupid, they think you unworthy to receive their earnest or patient attention, if you were either exhorting any one to do well, or reproving the malice and wickedness of an evil-doer. If, in proposing these questions, you contemplated this righteous and beneficent end, we have certainly been wronged by your not giving the preference to this in your letter as the consideration by which we might be moved either to grant willingly what you asked, or, if declining your request, to do so on the ground of some other cause which might perchance prevent us, but not on the ground of our being ashamed to accept the position of serving or even not resisting the aspirations of your vanity. For, I pray you, consider how much better and more profitable it is for you to receive from us with far more certainty and with less loss of time those principles of truth by which you can for yourself refute all that is false, and by so doing be prevented from cherishing an opinion so false and contemptible as this -- that you are learned and intelligent if you have studied with a zeal in which there is more pride than prudence the worn-out errors of many writers of a bygone age. But this opinion I do not suppose you now to hold, for surely I have not in vain spoken so long to Dioscorus things so manifestly true; and from this, as understood, I proceed with my letter.<br>
    Chap. II--8. Wherefore, seeing that you do not consider a man illiterate and stupid merely on the ground of ignorance of these things, but only if he be ignorant of the truth itself, and that, consequently, the opinions of any one who has<br>
<br>
441<br>
<br>
written or may have written on these subjects are either true, and therefore are already held by you, or false, and therefore you may be content not to know them, and need not be consumed with vain solicitude about knowing the variety of the opinions of other men under the fear of otherwise remaining illiterate and stupid, --seeing, I say, that this is the case, let us now, if you please, consider whether, in the event of other men, who are, as you say, prone to censure, finding you ignorant of these things, and therefore regarding you, though falsely, as an illiterate and stupid person, this mistake of theirs<br>
ought to have so much weight with you as to make it not unseemly for you to apply to bishops for instruction in these things. I propose this on the assumption that we now believe you] to be seeking this instruction in order that by it[ you may be helped in recommending the truth to men, and in reclaiming men who, if they sup- I posed you to be illiterate and stupid in regard to [ those books of Cicero, would regard you as a[ person from whom they considered it unworthy of them to receive any useful or profitable instruction. Believe me, you are under a mistake.<br>
    9. For, in the first place, I do not at all see that, in the countries in which you are so afraid of being esteemed deficient in education and acuteness, there are any persons who will ask you a single question about these matters. Both in this country, to which you came to learn these things, and at Rome, you know by experience how little they are esteemed, and that, in consequence, they are neither taught nor learned; and throughout all Africa, so far are you from being troubled by any such questioner, that you cannot find any one who will be troubled with your questions, and are compelled by the dearth of such persons to send your questions to bishops to be solved by them: as if, indeed, these bishops, although in their youth, under the influence of the same ardour--let me rather say error--which carries you away, they were at pains to learn these things as matters of great moment, permitted them still to remain in memory now that their heads are white with age and they are burdened with the responsibilities of episcopal office; or as if, supposing them to desire to retain these things in memory, greater and graver cares would not in spite of their desire banish them from their hearts; or as if, in the event of some of these things lingering in recollection by the force of long habit, they would not wish rather to bury in utter oblivion what was] thus remembered, than to answer senseless questions at a time when, even amidst the comparative leisure enjoyed in the schools and in the lecture-rooms of rhetoricians, they seem to have so lost both voice and vigour that, in order to have instruction imparted concerning them, it is deemed necessary to send from Carthage to Hippo,- a place in which all such things are so unwonted and so wholly foreign, that if, in taking the trouble of writing an answer to your question, I wished to look at any passage to discover the order of thought in the context preceding or following the words requiring exposition, I would be utterly unable to find a manuscript of the works of Cicero. However, these teachers of rhetoric in Carthage who have failed to satisfy you in this matter are not only not blamed, but, on the contrary, commended by me, if, as I suppose, they have not forgotten that the scene of these contests was wont to be, not the Roman forum, but the Greek gymnasia. But when you have applied your mind to these gymnasia, and have found even them to be in such things bare and cold, the church of the Christians of Hippo occurred to you as a place where you might lay down your cares, because the bishop now occupying that see at one time took fees for instructing boys in these things. But, on the one hand, I do not wish you to be still a boy, and, on the other hand, it is not becoming for me, either for a fee or as a favour, to be dealing now in childish things. This, therefore, being the case-seeing, that is to say, that these two great cities, Rome and Carthage, the living centres of Latin literature, neither try your patience by asking you such questions as you speak of, nor care patiently to listen to you when you propound them, I am amazed in a degree beyond all expression that a young man of your good sense should be afraid lest you should be afflicted with any questioner on these subjects in the cities of Greece and of the East. You are much more likely to hear jackdaws' in Africa than this manner of conversation in those lands.<br>
    10. Suppose, however, in the next place, that I am wrong, and that perchance some one should arise putting questions like these,- a phenomenon the more unwelcome because in those parts peculiarly absurd,- are you not much more afraid lest far more readily men arise who, being Greeks, and finding you settled in Greece, and acquainted with the Greek language as your mother tongue, may ask you some things in the original works of their philosophers which Cicero may not have put into his treatises? If this happen, what reply will you make? Will you say that you preferred to learn these things from the books of Latin rather than of Greek authors ? By such an answer you will, in the first place, put an affront upon Greece; and you know how men of. that nation resent this. And in the next place, they being now wounded and angry, how<br>
<br>
442<br>
<br>
readily will you find what you are too anxious to avoid, that they will count you on the one hand stupid, because you preferred to learn the opinions of the Greek philosophers, or, more properly speaking, some isolated and scattered tenets of their philosophy, in Latin dialogues, rather than to study the complete and connected system of their opinions in the Greek originals,and, on the other hand, illiterate, because, although ignorant of so many things written in your language, you have unsuccessfully laboured to gather some of them together from writings in a foreign tongue. Or will you perhaps reply that you did not despise the Greek writings on these subjects, but that you devoted your attention first to the study of Latin works, and now, proficient in these, are beginning to inquire after Greek learning? If this does not make you blush, to confess that you, being a Greek, have in your boyhood learned Latin, and are now, like a man of some foreign nation,' desirous of studying Greek literature, surely you will not blush to own that in the department of Latin literature you are ignorant of some things, of which you may perceive how many versed in Latin learning are equally ignorant, if you will only consider that, although living in the midst of so many learned men in Carthage, you assure me that it is under the pressure of necessity that you impose this burden on me.<br>
    11. Finally, suppose that you, being asked all those questions which you have submitted to me, have been able to answer them all. Behold! you are now spoken of as most learned and most acute; behold! now this insignificant breath of Greek laudation raises you to heaven. Be it yours now to remember your responsibilities and the end for which you coveted these praises, namely, that to men who have been easily won to admire you by these trifles, and who are now hanging most affectionately and eagerly on your lips, you may impart some truly important and wholesome instruction; and I should like to know whether you possess, and can rightly impart to others, that which is truly most important and wholesome. For it is absurd if, after learning many unnecessary things with a view to preparing the ears of men to receive what is necessary, you be found not to possess those necessary things for the reception of which you have by these unnecessary things prepared the way; it is absurd if, while busying yourself with learning things by which you may win men's attention, you refuse to learn that which may be poured into their minds when their attention is secured. But if you reply that you have already learned this, and say that the truth supremely necessary is Christian doctrine, which I know that you esteem above all other things, placing in it alone your hope of everlasting salvation, then surely this does not demand a knowledge of the Dialogues of Cicero, and a collection of the beggarly and divided opinions of other men, in order to your persuading men to give it a hearing. Let your character and manner of life command the attention of those who are to receive any such teaching from you. I would not have you open the way for teaching truth by first teaching what . must be afterwards unlearned.<br>
  12. For if the knowledge of the discordant and mutually contradictory opinions of others is of any service to him who would obtain an en-'trance for Christian truth in overthrowing the opposition of error, it is useful only in the way i of preventing the assailant of the truth from i being at liberty to fix his eye solely on the work of controverting your tenets, while carefully hiding his own from view. For the knowledge of the truth is of itself sufficient both to detect and 'to subvert all errors, even those which may not have been heard before, if only they are brought ' forward. If, however, in order to secure not only the demolition of open errors, but also the rooting out of those which lurk in darkness, it is necessary for you to be acquainted with the erroneous opinions which others have advanced, let both eye and ear be wakeful, I beseech you, --look well and listen well whether any of our assailants bring forward a single argument from Anaximenes and from Anaxagoras, when, though the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies were more recent and taught largely, even their ashes are not so warm as that a single spark can be struck out from them against the Christian faith. The i din which resounds in the battle-field of controversy now comes from innumerable small companies and cliques of sectaries, some of them easily discomfited, others presuming to make bold resistance,- such as the partisans of Donatus, Maximian, and Manichaeus here, or the unruly herds of Arians, Eunomians, Macedonians, and Cataphrygians and other pests which abound in the countries to which you are on your way. If you shrink from the task of acquainting yourself with the errors of all these sects, what occasion have we in defending the Christian religion to inquire after the tenets of Anaximenes, and with idle curiosity to awaken anew controversies which have slept for ages, when already the cavillings and arguments even of some of the heretics who claimed the glory of the Christian name, such as the Marcionites and the Sabellians, and man), more, have been put to silence ? Nevertheless, if it be necessary, as I have said, to know beforehand some of the opinions which war against the truth, and become thoroughly conversant with these, it is our i duty to give a place in such study to the here-<br>
<br>
443<br>
<br>
tics who call themselves Christians, much rather than to Anaxagoras and Democritus.<br>
    Chap. III.- 13. Again, whoever may put to you the questions which you have propounded to us, let him understand that, under the guidance of deeper erudition and greater wisdom, you are ignorant of things like these. For if Themistocles regarded it as a small matter that he was looked upon as imperfectly educated when he had declined to play on the lyre at a banquet, and at the same time, when, after he had confessed ignorance of this accomplishment, one said, "What, then, do you know?" gave as his reply, "The art of making a small republic great "--are you to hesitate about admitting ignorance in trifles like these, when it is in your power to answer any one who may ask, "What, then, do you know ? "--" The secret by which without such knowledge a man may be blessed "? And if you do not yet possess this secret, you act in searching into those other matters with as blind perversity as if, when labouring under some dangerous disease of the body, you eagerly sought after dainties in food and finery in dress, instead of physic and physicians. For this attainment ought not to be put off upon any pretext whatever, and no other knowledge ought, especially in our age, to receive a prior place in your studies. And now see how easily you may have this knowledge if you desire it. He who inquires how he may attain a blessed life is assuredly inquiring after nothing else than this: where is the highest good? in other words, wherein resides man's supreme good, not according to the perverted and hasty opinions of men, but according to the sure and immovable truth? Now its residence is not found by any one except in the body, or in the mind, or on God, or in two of these, or in the three combined. If, then, you have learned that neither the supreme good nor any part whatever of the Supreme good is in the body, the remaining alternatives are, that it is in the mind, or in God, or in both combined. And if now you have also learned that what is true of the body in this respect is equally true of the mind, what now remains but God Himself as the One in whom resides man's supreme good ? -- not that' there are no other goods, but that good is called the supreme good to which all others are related. For every one is blessed when he enjoys that for the sake of which he desires to have all other things, seeing that it is loved for its own sake, and not on account of something else. And the supreme good is said to be there because at this point nothing is found towards l which the supreme good can go forth, or to which it is related. In it is the resting-place of desire; in it is assured fruition; in it the most tranquil satisfaction of a will morally perfect.<br>
14. Give me a man who sees at once that the body is not the good of the mind, but that the mind is rather the good of the body: with such a man we would, of course, forbear from inquiring whether the highest good of which we speak, or any part of it, is in the body. For that the mind is better than the body is a truth which it would be utter folly to deny. Equally absurd would it be to deny that that which gives a happy life, or any part of a happy life, is better than that which receives the boon. The mind, therefore, does not receive from the body either the supreme good or any part of the supreme good. ' Men who do not see this have been blinded by that sweetness of carnal pleasures which they do ' not discern to be a consequence of imperfect I health Now, perfect health of body shall be the consummation of the immortality of the whole man. For God has endowed the soul with a nature so powerful, that from that consummate fulness of joy which is promised to the saints in the end of time, some portion overflows also upon the lower part of our nature, the body,- not the blessedness which is proper to the part which enjoys and understands, but the plenitude of health, that is, the vigour of incorruption. Men who, as I have said, do not see this war with each other in unsatisfactory debates, each maintaining the view which may please his own fancy, but all placing the supreme good of man in the body, and so stir up crowds of disorderly carnal minds, of whom the Epicureans have flourished in pre-eminent estimation with the unlearned multitude.<br>
    15. Give me a man who sees at once, moreover, that when the mind is happy, it is happy not by good which belongs to itself, else it would never be unhappy: and with such a man we would, of course, forbear from inquiring whether that highest and, so to speak, bliss-bestowing good, or any part of it, is in the mind. For when the mind is elated with joy in itself, as if in good which belongs to itself, it is proud. But when the mind perceives itself to be mutable,a fact which may be learned from this, even though nothing else proved it, that the mind from being foolish may be made wise,- and apprehends that wisdom is unchangeable, it must at the same time apprehend that wisdom is superior to its own nature, and that it finds more abundant and abiding joy in the communications and light of wisdom than in itself. Thus desisting and subsiding from boasting and self-conceit, it strives to cling to God, and to be recruited and reformed by Him who is unchangeable; whom it now understands to be the Author not only of every species of all things with which it comes in contact, either by the bodily senses or by intellectual faculties, but also of even the very capacity of taking form before any form has been taken, since the formless is defined to<br>
<br>
444<br>
<br>
be that which can receive a form. Therefore it feels its own instability more, just in proportion as it clings less to God, whose being is perfect: it discerns also that the perfection of His being is consummate because He is immutable, and therefore neither gains nor loses, but that in itself every change by which it gains capacity for perfect clinging to God is advantageous, but every change by which it loses is pernicious, and further, that all loss tends towards destruction; and although it is not manifest whether any thing is ultimately destroyed, it is manifest to every one that the loss brings destruction so far that the object no longer is what it was. Whence the mind infers that the one reason why things suffer loss, or are liable to suffer loss, is, that they were made out of nothing; so that their property of being, and of permanence, and the arrangement whereby each finds even according to its imperfections its own place in the complex whole, all depend on the goodness and omnipotence of Him whose being is perfect,' and who is the Creator able to make out of nothing not only something, but something great; and that the first sin, i.e. the first voluntary loss, is rejoicing in its own power: for it rejoices in something less than would be the[ source of its joy if it rejoiced in the power of[ God, which is unquestionably greater. Not perceiving this, and looking only to the capacities of the human mind, and the great beauty of its achievements in word and deed, some, who would have been ashamed to place man's supreme good in the body, have, by placing it in the mind, assigned to it unquestionably a lower sphere than that assigned to it by unsophisticated reason. Among Greek philosophers who hold these views, the chief place both in number of adherents and in subtlety of disputation has been held by the Stoics, who have, however, in consequence of their opinion that in nature everything is material, succeeded in turning the mind rather from carnal than material objects.<br>
    16. Among those, again, who say that our supreme and only good is to enjoy God, by whom both we ourselves and all things were made, the most eminent have been the Platonists, who not unreasonably judged it to belong to their duty to confute the Stoics and Epicureans--the latter especially, and almost exclusively. The Academic School is identical with the Platonists, as is shown plainly enough by the links of unbroken succession connecting the schools. For if you ask who was the predecessor of Arcesilas, the first who, announcing no doctrine of his own, set himself to the one work of refuting the Stoics and Epicureans, you will find that it was Polemo; ask who preceded Polemo, it was Xenocrates; but Xenocrates was Plato's disciple, and by him appointed his successor in the academy. Wherefore, as to this question concerning the supreme good, if we set aside the representatives of conflicting views, and consider the abstract question, you find at once that two errors confront each other as diametrically opposed --the one declaring the body, and the other declaring the mind to be the seat of the supreme good of men. You find also that truly enlightened reason, by which God is perceived to be our supreme good, is opposed to both of these errors, but does not impart the knowledge of what is true until it has first made men unlearn what is false. If now you consider the question in connection with the advocates of different views, you will find the Epicureans and Stoics most keenly contending with each other, and the Platonists, on the other hand, endeavouring to decide the controversy between them, concealing the truth which they held, and devoting themselves only to prove and overthrow the vain confidence with which the others adhered to error.<br>
    17. It was not in the power of the Platonists, however, to be so efficient in supporting the side of reason enlightened by truth, as the others were in supporting their own errors. For from them all there was then withheld that example of divine humility, which, in the fullness of time,' was furnished by our Lord Jesus Christ,- that one example before which, even in the mind of the most headstrong and arrogant, all pride bends, breaks, and dies. And therefore the Platonists, not being able by their authority to lead the mass of mankind, blinded by love of earthly things, into faith in things invisible, --although they saw them moved, especially by the arguments of the Epicureans, not only to drink freely the cup of the pleasures of the body to which they were naturally inclined, but even to plead for these, affirming that they constitute man's highest good; although, moreover, they saw that those who were moved to abstinence from these pleasures by the praise of virtue found it easier to regard pleasure as having its true seat in the soul, whence the good actions, concerning which they were able, in some measure, to form an opinion, proceeded,- at the same time, saw that if they attempted to introduce into the minds of men the notion of something divine and supremely immutable, which cannot be reached by any one of the bodily senses, but is apprehensible only by reason, which, nevertheless, surpasses in its nature the mind itself, and were to teach that this is God, set before the human soul to be enjoyed by it when purged from all stains of human desires, [in whom alone every longing after happiness<br>
<br>
445<br>
<br>
finds rest, and in whom alone we ought to find the consummation of all good,--men would not understand them, and would much more readily award the palm to their antagonists, whether Epicureans or Stoics; the result of which would be a thing most disastrous to the human race, namely, that the doctrine, which is true and profitable, would become sullied by the contempt of the uneducated masses. So much in regard to Ethical questions.<br>
    18. As to Physics, if the Platonists taught that the originating cause of all natures is immaterial wisdom, and if, on the other hand, the rival sects of philosophers never got above material things, while the beginning of all things was attributed by some to atoms, by others to the four elements, in which fire was of special power in the construction of all things, --who could fail to see to which opinion a favourable verdict would be given, when the great mass of unthinking men are enthralled by material things, and can in no wise comprehend that an immaterial power could form the universe ?<br>
    19. The department of dialectic questions remains to be discussed; for, as you are aware, all questions in the pursuit of wisdom are classified under three heads, --Ethics, Physics, and Dialectics. When, therefore, the Epicureans said that the senses are never deceived, and, though the Stoics admitted that they sometimes are mistaken, both placed in the senses the standard by which truth is to be comprehended, who would listen to the Platonists when both of these sects opposed them ? Who would look upon them as entitled to be esteemed men at all, and much less wise men, if, without hesitation or qualification, they affirmed not only that there is something which cannot be discerned by touch, or smell, or taste, or hearing, or sight, and which cannot be conceived of by any image borrowed from the things with which the senses acquaint us, but that this alone truly exists, and is alone capable of being perceived, because it is alone unchangeable and eternal, but is perceived only[ by reason, the faculty whereby alone truth, in so: far as it can be discovered by us, is found ?<br>
    20. Seeing, therefore, that the Platonists held opinions which they could not impart to men: enthralled by the flesh; seeing also that they were not of such authority among the common people as to persuade them to accept what they ought to believe until the mind should be trained to that condition in which these things can be understood,- they chose to hide their own opinions, and to content themselves with arguing against those who, although they affirmed that the discovery of truth is made through the senses of the body, boasted that they had found the truth. And truly, what occasion have we to inquire as to the nature of' their teaching? We know that it was not divine, nor invested with any divine authority. But this one fact merits our attention, that whereas Plato is in many ways most clearly proved by Cicero to have placed both the supreme good and the causes of things, and the certainty of the processes of reason, in Wisdom, not human, but divine, whence in some way the light of human wisdom is derived -- in Wisdom which is wholly immutable, and in Truth always consistent with itself; and whereas we also learn from Cicero that the followers of Plato laboured to overthrow the philosophers known as Epicureans and Stoics, who placed the supreme good, the causes of things, and the certainty of the processes of reason, in the nature either of body or of mind, -- the controversy had continued rolling on with successive centuries, so that even at the commencement of the Christian era, when the faith of things invisible and eternal was with saving power preached by means of visible miracles to men, who could neither see nor imagine anything beyond things material, these same Epicureans and Stoics are found in the Acts of the Apostles to have opposed themselves to the blessed Apostle Paul, who was beginning to scatter the seeds of that faith among the Gentiles.<br>
    21. By which thing it seems to me to be sufficiently proved that the errors of the Gentiles in ethics, physics, and the mode of seeking truth, errors many and manifold, but conspicuously represented in these two schools of philosophy, continued even down to the Christian era, notwithstanding the fact that the learned assailed them most vehemently, and employed both remarkable skill and abundant labour in subverting them. Yet these errors we see in our time to have been already so completely silenced, that now in our schools of rhetoric the question what their opinions were is scarcely ever mentioned; and these controversies have been now so completely eradicated or suppressed in even the Greek gymnasia, notably fond of discussion, that whenever now any school of error lifts up its head against the truth, i.e. against the Church of Christ, it does not venture to leap into the arena except under the shield of the Christian name. Whence it is obvious that the Platonist school of philosophers felt it necessary, having changed those few things in their opinions which Christian teaching condemned, to submit with pious homage to Christ, the only King who is invincible, and to apprehend the Incarnate Word of God, at whose command the truth which they had even feared to publish was immediately believed.<br>
    22. To Him, my Dioscorus, I desire you to submit yourself with unreserved piety, and I wish you to prepare for yourself no other way of seizing and holding the truth than that which<br>
<br>
446<br>
<br>
has been prepared by Him who, as God, saw the weakness of our goings. In that way the first part is humility; the second, humility; the third, humility: and this I would continue to repeat as often as you might ask direction, not that there are no other instructions which may be given, but because, unless humility precede, accompany, and follow every good action which we perform, being at once the object which we keep before our eyes, the support to which we cling, and the monitor by which we are restrained, pride wrests wholly from our hand any good work on which we are congratulating ourselves.' All other vices are to be apprehended when we are doing wrong; but pride is to be feared even when we do right actions, test those things which are done in a praiseworthy manner be spoiled by the desire for praise itself. Wherefore, as that most illustrious orator, on being asked what seemed to him the first thing to be observed in the art of eloquence, is said to have replied, Delivery; and when he was asked what was the second thing, replied again, Delivery; and when asked what was the third thing, still gave no other reply than this, Delivery; so if you were to ask me, however often you might repeat the question, what are the instructions of the Christian religion, I would be disposed to answer always and only, "Humility," although, perchance, necessity might constrain me to speak also of other things.<br>
    Chap. IV. -- 53. To this most wholesome humility, in which our Lord Jesus Christ is our teacher --having submitted to humiliation that He might instruct us in this- to this humility, I say, the most formidable adversary is a certain kind of most unenlightened knowledge, if I may so call it, in which we congratulate ourselves on knowing what may have been the views of Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, Democritus, and others of the same kind, imagining that by this we become learned men and scholars, although such attainments are far removed from true learning and erudition. For the man who has learned that God is not extended or diffused through space, either finite or infinite, so as to be greater in one part and less in another, but that He is wholly present everywhere, as the Truth is, of which no one in his senses will affirm that it is partly in one place, partly in another --and the Truth is God Himself--such a man will not be moved by the opinions of any philosopher soever who believes [like Anaximenes] that the infinite air around us is the true God. What matters it to such a man though he be ignorant what bodily form they speak of, since they speak of a form which is bounded on all sides? What matters it to him whether it was only as an Academician, and merely for the purpose of confuting Anaximenes, who had said that God is a material existence, -- for air is material, -- that Cicero objected that God must have form and beauty?2 or himself perceived that truth has immaterial form and beauty, by which the mind itself is moulded, and by which we judge all the deeds of the wise man to be beautiful, and therefore affirmed that God must be of the most perfect beauty, not merely for the purpose of confuting an antagonist, but with profound [insight into the fact that nothing is more beautiful than truth itself, which is cognisable by the understanding alone, and is immutable ? Moreover, as to the opinion of Anaximenes, who held that the air is generated, and at the same time believed it to be God, it does not in the least move the man who understands that, since the air is certainly not God, there is no likeness between the manner in which the air is generated, that is to say, produced by some cause, and the manner, understood by none except through divine inspiration, in which He was begotten who is the Word of God, God with God. Moreover, who does not see that even in regard to material things he speaks most foolishly in affirming that air is generated, and is at the same time God, while he refuses to give the name of God to that by which the air has been generated, -- for it is impossible that it could be generated by no power ? Yet once more, his saying that the air is always in motion will have no disturbing influence as proof that the air is God upon the man who knows that all movements of body are of a lower order than movements of the soul, but that even the movements of the soul are infinitely slow compared with His who is supreme and immutable Wisdom.<br>
    24. In like manner, if Anaxagoras or any other affirm that the mind is essential truth and wisdom? what call have I to debate with a man about a word? For it is manifest that mind gives being to the order and mode of all things, and that it may be suitably called infinite with respect not to its extension in space, but to its power, the range of which transcends all human thought. Nor [shall I dispute his assertion] that this essential wisdom is formless; for this is a property of material things, that whatever<br>
<br>
447<br>
<br>
bodies are infinite are also formless. Cicero, however, from his desire to confute such opinions, as I suppose, in contending with adversaries who believed in nothing immaterial, denies that anything can be annexed to that which is infinite, because in things material there must be a boundary at the part to which anything is annexed. Therefore he says that Anaxagoras "did not see that motion joined to sensation and to it" (i.e. linked to it in unbroken connection) "is impossible in the infinite "(that is, m a substance which is infinite), as if treating of material substances, to which nothing can be joined except at their boundaries. Moreover, in the succeeding words-" and that sensation of which the whole system of nature is not sensible when struck is an impossibility .... Cicero speaks as if Anaxagoras had said that mind-to which he ascribed the power of ordering and fashioning all things -- had sensation such as the soul has by means of the body. For it is manifest that the whole soul has sensation when it feels anything by means of the body; for whatever is perceived by sensation is not concealed from the whole soul. Now, Cicero's design in saying that the whole system of nature must be conscious of every sensation was, that he might, as it were, take from the philosopher that mind which he affirms to be infinite. For how does: the whole of nature experience sensation if it be infinite? Bodily sensation begins at some point, and does not pervade the whole of any substance unless it be one in which it can reach an end; but this, of course, cannot be said of that which is infinite. Anaxagoras, however had not said anything about bodily sensation. The word "whole," moreover, is used differently when we speak of that which is immaterial, because it is understood to be without boundaries in space, so that it may be spoken of as a whole and at the same time as infinite --the former because of its completeness, the latter because of its not being limited by boundaries in space.<br>
    25. "Furthermore," says Cicero, "if he will affirm that the mind itself is, so to speak, some kind of animal, there must be some principle from within from which it receives the name' animal,' "-- so that mind, according to Anaxagoras, is a kind of body, and has within it an animating, principle, because of which it is called "animal." Observe how he speaks in language which we are accustomed to apply to things corporeal,animals being in the ordinary sense of the word visible substances,- adapting himself, as I suppose, to the blunted perceptions of those against whom he argues; and yet he has uttered a thing which, if they could awake to perceive it, might suffice to teach them that everything which presents itself to our minds as a living body must be thought of not as itself a soul, but as an animal having a soul. For having said, "There must be something within from which it receives the name animal," he adds, "But what is deeper within than mind ?" The mind, therefore, cannot have any inner soul, by possessing which it is an animal; for it is itself that which is inner! most. If, then, it is an animal, let it have some i external body in relation to which it may be within; for this is what he means by saying, "It is therefore girt round by an exterior body," as if Anaxagoras had said that mind cannot be otherwise than as belonging to some animal. And yet Anaxagoras held the opinion that essential supreme Wisdom is mind, although it is not the peculiar property of any living being, so to speak, since Truth is near to all souls alike that are able to enjoy it. Observe, therefore, how wittily he concludes the argument: "Since this is not the opinion of Anaxagoras" (i.e. seeing that he does not hold that that mind which he calls God is girt about with an external body, through its relation to which it could be an animal), "we must say that mind pure and simple, without the addition of anything" (i.e. of any body) "through which it may exercise sensation, seems to be beyond the range and conceptions of our intelligence."2<br>
    26. Nothing is more certain than that this lies beyond the range and conception of the intelligence of Stoics and Epicureans, who cannot think of and, thing which is not material. But by the word "our" intelligence he means "human" intelligence; and he very properly does not say, "it lies beyond our intelligence," but "it seems to lie beyond." For their opinion is, that this lies beyond the understanding of all men, and therefore they think that nothing of the kind can be. But there are some whose intelligence apprehends, in so far as this is given to man, the fact that there is pure and simple Wisdom and Truth, which is the peculiar property of no living being, but which imparts wisdom and truth to all souls alike which are susceptible of its influence. If Anaxagoras perceived the existence of this supreme Wisdom, and apprehended it to be God, and called it Mind, it is not by the mere name of this philosopher-with whom, on account of his place in the remote antiquity of erudition, all raw recruits in literature s (to adopt a military phrase) delight to boast an acquaintance- that we are made learned and wise; nor is it even by our having the knowledge through which he knew this truth. For truth ought to be dear to me not<br>
<br>
448<br>
<br>
merely because it was not unknown to Anaxagoras, but because, even though none of these philosophers had known it, it is the truth.<br>
    27. If, therefore, it is unbecoming for us to be elated either by the knowledge of the man who peradventure apprehended the truth, by which knowledge we obtain, as it were, the appearance of learning, or even by the solid possession of the truth itself, whereby we obtain real acquisitions in learning, how much less can the names and tenets of those men who were in error assist us in Christian learning and in making known things obscure ? For if we be men, it would be more fitting that we should grieve on account of the errors into which so many famous men fell, if we happen to hear of them, than that we should studiously investigate them, in order that, among men who are ignorant of them, we may enjoy the gratification of a most contemptible conceit of knowledge. For how much better would it be that I should never have heard the name of Democritus, than that I should now with sorrow ponder the fact that a man was highly esteemed in his own age who thought that the gods were images which emanated from solid bodies, but were not solid themselves; and that these, circling this way and that way by their independent motion, and gliding into the minds of men, make the divine power enter into the region of their thoughts, although, certainly, that body from which the image emanated may be rightly judged to surpass the image in excellence and proportion, as it surpasses it in solidity. Hence his opinion wavered, as they say, and oscillated, so that sometimes he said that the deity was some kind of nature from which images emanate, and which nevertheless can be thought of only by means of those images which he pours forth and sends out, that is, which from that nature (which he considered to be something material and eternal, and on this very account divine) were borne as by a kind of evaporation or continuous emanation, and came and entered into our � minds, so that we could form the thought of a god or gods. For these philosophers conceive of no cause of thought in our minds, except when images from those bodies which are the object of our thoughts come and enter into our! minds; as if, forsooth, there were not many things, yea, more than we can number, which, without any material form, and yet intelligible, are apprehended by those who know how to apprehend such things. Take as an example essential Wisdom and Truth, of which if they can frame no idea, I wonder why they dispute concerning it at all; if, however, they do frame some idea of it in thought, I wish they would tell me either from what body the image of truth comes into their minds, or of what kind it is.<br>
<br>
    28. Democritus, however, is said to differ here also in his doctrine on physics from Epicurus; for he holds that there is in the concourse of atoms a certain vital and breathing power, by which power (I believe) he affirms that the images themselves (not all images of all things, but images of the gods) are endued with divine attributes, and that the first beginnings of the mind are in those universal elements to which he ascribed divinity, and that the images possess life, inasmuch as they are wont either to benefit or to hurt us. Epicurus, however, does not assume anything in the first beginnings of things but atoms, that is, certain corpuscles, so minute that they cannot be divided or perceived either by sight or by touch; and his doctrine is, that by the fortuitous concourse (clashing) of these atoms, existence is given both to innumerable worlds and to living things, and to the souls which animate them, and to the gods whom, in human form, he has located, not in any world, but outside of the worlds, and in the spaces which separate them; and he will not allow of any object of thought beyond things material. But in order to these becoming an object of thought, he says that from those things which he represents as formed of atoms, images more subtle than those which come to our eyes flow down and enter into the mind. For according to him, the cause of our seeing is to be found in certain images so huge that they embrace the whole outer world. But I suppose that you already understand their opinions regarding these images.<br>
    29. I wonder that Democritus was not convinced of the error of his philosophy even by this fact, that such huge images coming into our minds, which are so small {,if being, as they affirm, material, the soul is confined within the body's dimensions), could not possibly, in the entirety of their size, come into contact with it. For when a small body is brought into contact with a large one, it cannot in any wise be touched at the same moment by all points of the larger. How, then, are these images at the same moment in their whole extent objects of thought, if they become objects of thought only in so far as, coming and entering into the mind, they touch it, seeing that they cannot in their whole extent either find entrance into so small a body or come in contact with so small a mind ? Bear in mind, of course, that I am speaking now after their manner; for I do not hold the mind to be such as they affirm. It is true that Epicurus alone can be assailed with this argument, if Democritus holds that the mind is immaterial; but we may ask him in turn why he did not perceive that it is at once unnecessary and impossible for the mind, being immaterial, to think through the approach and contact of material<br>
449<br>
<br>
images. Both philosophers alike are certainly confuted by the facts of vision; for images so great cannot possibly touch in their entirety eyes so small.<br>
    30. Moreover, when the question is put to them, how it comes that one image is seen of a body from which images emanate in countless multitudes, their answer is, that just because the images are emanating and passing in such multitudes, the effect produced by their being crowded and massed together is, that out of the many one is seen. The absurdity of this Cicero exposes by saying that their deity cannot be thought of as eternal, for this very reason, that he is thought of through images which are in countless multitudes flowing forth and passing away. And when they say that the forms of the gods are rendered eternal by the innumerable hosts of atoms supplying constant reinforcements, so that other corpuscles immediately take the place of those which depart from the divine substance, and by the same succession prevent the nature of the gods from being dissolved, Cicero replies, "On this ground all things would be eternal as well as the gods," since there is nothing which has not the same boundless store of atoms by which it may repair its perpetual decays. Again, he asks how their god could be otherwise than afraid of coming to destruction, seeing that he is without a moment's intermission beaten and shaken by an unceasing incursion of atoms,beaten, inasmuch as he is struck by atoms rushing upon him, and shaken, inasmuch as he is penetrated by atoms rushing through him. Nay, more; seeing that from himself there emanate continually images (of which we have said enough), what good ground can he have for persuasion of his own immortality ?'<br>
    31. As to all these ravings of the men who entertain such opinions, it is especially deplorable that the mere statement of them does not suffice to secure their rejection without any one controverting them in discussion; instead of, which, the minds of men most gifted with acuteness have accepted the task of copiously refuting opinions which, as soon as they were enunciated Ought to have been rejected with contempt even by the slowest intellects. For even granting that there are atoms, and that these strike and shake each other by clashing together as chance may guide them, is it lawful for us to grant also that atoms thus meeting in fortuitous concourse can so make anything as to fashion its distinctive forms, determine its figure, polish its surface, enliven it with color, or quicken it by imparting to it a spirit ? -- all which things every one sees to be accomplished in no other way than by the providence of God, if only he loves to see with the mind rather than with the eye alone, and asks this faculty of intelligent perception from the Author of his being. Nay, more; we are not at liberty even to grant the existence of atoms themselves, for, without discussing the subtle theories of the learned as to the divisibility of matter, observe how easily the absurdity of atoms may be proved from their own opinions. For they, as is well known, affirm that there is nothing else in nature but bodies and empty space, and the accidents of these, by which I believe that they mean motion and striking, and the forms which result from these. Let them tell us, then, under which category they reckon the images which they suppose to flow from the more solid bodies, but which, if indeed they are bodies, possess so little solidity that they are not discernible except by their contact with the eyes when we see them, and with the mind when we think of them. For the opinion of these philosophers is, that these images can proceed from the material object and , come to the eyes or to the mind, which, nevertheless, they affirm to be material. Now, I ask, Ho these images flow from atoms themselves ? If they do, how can these be atoms from which some bodily particles are in this process separated? If they do not, either something can be the object of thought without such images, which they vehemently deny, or we ask, whence have they acquired a knowledge of atoms, seeing that they can in nowise become objects of thought to us? But I blush to have even thus far refuted these opinions, although they did not blush to hold them. When, however, I consider that they have even dared to defend them, I blush not on their account, but for the race of mankind itself whose ears could tolerate such nonsense.<br>
    CHAP. v.--32. Wherefore, seeing that the minds of men are, through the pollution of sin and the lust of the flesh, so blinded that even these monstrous errors could waste in discussion concerning them the leisure of learned men, will you, Dioscorus, or will any man of an servant mind, hesitate to affirm that in no way could better provision have been made for the pursuit of truth by mankind than that a Man, assumed into ineffable and miraculous union by the Truth Himself, and being the manifestation of His Person on the earth, should by perfect .teaching and divine acts move men to saving faith in that which could not as yet be intellectually apprehended ? To the glory of Him who has done this we give our service; and we exhort you to believe immoveably and stedfastly in Him through whom it has come ta pass that not a select few, but whole peoples, unable to discern these things by reason, do accept them in faith, until, upheld by instruction in saving truth, they<br>
<br>
450<br>
<br>
escape from these perplexities into the' atmosphere of perfectly pure and simple truth. It becomes us, moreover, to field submission to His authority all the more unreservedly, when we see that in our day no error dares to lift up itself to rally round it the uninstructed crowd without seeking the shelter of the Christian name, and that of all who, belonging to an earlier age, now remain outside of the Christian name, those alone continue to have in their obscure assemblies a considerable attendance who retain the Scriptures by which, however they may pretend not to see or understand it, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself was prophetically announced. Moreover, those who, though they are not within the Catholic unity and communion, boast of the name of Christians, are compelled to oppose them that believe, and presume' to mislead the ignorant by a pretence of appealing to reason, since the Lord came with this remedy above all others, that He enjoined on the nations the duty of faith. But they are compelled, as I have said, to adopt this policy because they feel themselves most miserably overthrown if their authority is compared with the Catholic authority. They attempt, accordingly, to prevail against the firmly-settled authority of the immoveable Church by the name and the promises of a pretended appeal to reason This kind of effrontery is, we may, say, characteristic of all heretics. But He who is the most merciful Lord of faith has both secured the Church in the citadel of authority by most famous oecumenical Councils and the Apostolic sees themselves, and furnished her with the abundant armour of equally invincible reason by means of a few men of pious erudition and unfeigned spirituality. The perfection of method in training disciples is, that those who are weak be encouraged to the utmost to enter the citadel of authority, in order that when they have been safely placed.. there, the conflict necessary for their defence may be maintained with the most strenuous use of reason.<br>
    33. The Platonists, however, who, amidst the errors of false philosophies assailing them at that time on all sides, rather concealed their own doctrine to be searched for than brought it into the light to be vilified, as they had no divine personage to command faith, began to exhibit and unfold the doctrines of Plato after the name of Christ had become widely known to the wondering and troubled kingdoms of this world. Then flourished at Rome the school of Plotinus, which had as scholars many men of great acuteness and ability. But some of them were corrupted by curious inquiries into magic, and others, recognising in the Lord Jesus Christ the impersonation of that essential and immutable Truth and Wisdom which they were endeavouring to reach, passed into His service. Thus the whole supremacy of authority and light of reason for regenerating and reforming the human race has been made to reside in the one saving Name, and in His one Church.<br>
    34. I do not at all regret that I have stated these things at great length in this letter, although perhaps you would have preferred that I had taken another course; for the more progress that you make in the truth, the more will you approve what I have written, and you will then approve of my counsel, though now you do not think it helpful to your studies. At the same time, I have, to the best of my ability, given answers to your questions,- to some of them in this letter, and to almost all the rest by brief annotations on the parchments on which you had sent them. If in these answers you think I have done too little, or done something else than you expected, you do not duly consider, my Dioscorus, to whom you addressed your questions. I have passed without reply all the questions concerning the orator and the books of Cicero de Oratore. I would have seemed to myself a contemptible trifler if I had entered on the exposition of these topics. For I might with propriety be questioned on all the other subjects, if any one desired me to handle and expound them, not in connection with the works of Cicero, but by themselves; but in these questions the subjects themselves are not in harmony with my profession now. I would not, however, have done all that I have done in this letter had I not removed from Hippo for a time after the illness under which I laboured when your messenger came to me. Even in these days I have been visited again with interruption of health and with fever, on which account there has been more delay than might otherwise have been in sending these to you. I earnestly beg you to write and let me know how you receive them.<br>

<br>
	TO HIS WELL-BELOVED BRETHREN THE CLERGY, AND TO THE WHOLE PEOPLE' [OF HIPPO], AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. In the first place, I beseech you, my friends, and implore you, for Christ's sake, not to let my bodily absence grieve you. For I suppose you do not imagine that I could by any means be separated in spirit and in unfeigned love from you, although perchance it is even a greater grief to me than to you that my weakness unfits me for bearing all the cares which are i laid on me by those members of Christ to whose service both fear of Him and love to them constrain me to devote myself. For you know this,<br>
<br>
451<br>
<br>
my beloved, that I have never absented myself from you through self-indulgent taking of ease, but only when compelled by such duties as have made it necessary for some of my holy colleagues and brethren to endure, both on the sea and in countries beyond the sea, labours from which I was exempted, not because of reluctance of spirit, but by reason of imperfect bodily health. Wherefore, my dearly-beloved brethren, act so that, as the apostle says, "whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel."' If any vexation pertaining to time causes you distress, this itself ought the more to remind you how you should occupy your thoughts with that life in which you may live without any burden, escaping not the annoying hardships of this short life, but the dread flames of eternal fire. For if ye strive with so much anxiety, so much earnestness, and so much labour, to save yourselves from failing into some transient sufferings in this world, how solicitous ought you to be to escape everlasting misery ! And if the death which puts an end to the labours of time is so feared, how ought we to fear the death which ushers men into eternal pain! And if the short-lived and sordid pleasures of this world are so loved, with how much greater earnestness ought we to seek the pure and infinite joys of the world to come ! Meaditating upon these things, be not slothful in good works, that ye may come in due season to reap what you have sown.<br>
    2. It has been reported to me that you have forgotten your custom of providing raiment for the poor, to which work of charity I exhorted you when I was present with you; and I now exhort you not to allow yourselves to be overcome and made slothful by the tribulation of this world, which you see now visited with such calamities as were foretold by our Lord and Redeemer, who cannot lie. You ought in present circumstances not to be less diligent in works of charity, but rather to be more abundant in these than you were wont to be. For as men betake then{selves !n greater haste to a place of greater security when they see in the shaking of their walls the ruin of their house impending, so ought Christians, the more that they perceive, from the increasing frequency of their afflictions, that the destruction of this world is at hand, to be the more prompt and active in transferring l to the treasury of heaven the goods which they 'were proposing to store up on earth, in order Z that, if any accident common to the lot of men occur, he may rejoice who has escaped from a dwelling doomed to ruin; and if, on the other hand, nothing of this kind happen, he may be exempt from painful solicitude who, die when he may, has committed his possessions to the keeping of the ever-living Lord, to whom he is about to go. Wherefore, my dearly-beloved brethren, let every one of you, according to his ability, of which he himself is the best judge, do with a portion of his substance as ye were wont to do; do it also with a more willing mind than ye were wont i and amid all the vexations of this life bear in your hearts the apostolic exhortation: "The Lord is at hand: be careful for nothing."' Let such things be reported to me concerning you as may make me understand that it is not through my presence with you, but from obedience to the precept of God, who is never absent, that you follow that good practice which for many years while I was with you, and for some time after my departure, you observed.<br>
    May the Lord preserve you in peace ! And, dearly-beloved brethren, pray for us.<br>

	TO ALBINA, PINIANUS, AND MELANIA, HONOURED IN THE LORD, BELOVED IN HOLINESS AND LONGED FOR IN BROTHERLY AFFECTION AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. I AM, whether through present infirmity or by natural temperament, very susceptible of cold; nevertheless, it would not be possible for me to suffer greater heat than I have done throughout this exceptionally dreadful winter, having been kept in a fever by distress because I have been unable, I do not say to hasten, but to fly to you (to visit whom it would have been fitting for me to fly across the seas), after you had been settled so near to me, and had come from so remote a land to see me. It may be, also, that you have supposed the rigorous weather of this winter to be the only cause of my suffering this disappointment; I pray you, beloved, give no place to this thought. For what inconvenience, hardship, or even danger, can these heavy rains bring, which I would not have encountered and endured in order to make my way to you, who are such comforters to us in our great calamities, and who, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, are lights kindled into vehement flame by the Supreme Light, raised aloft by lowliness of spirit, and deriving more glorious lustre from the glory which you have despised? Moreover, I would have enjoyed participation in the spiritual felicity vouchsafed to my earthly birthplace, in that it has been permitted to have you present, of whom when absent its citizens had heard much--so much, indeed, that although giving charitable credence to the report of what you were by nature and had become by grace, they feared, perchance, to repeat it to others, lest it should be disbelieved.<br>
    2. I shall therefore tell you the reason why I have not come, and the trials by which I have been kept back from so great a privilege, that I may obtain not only your forgiveness, but also, through your prayers, the mercy of Him who so works in you that ye live to Him. The congregation of Hippo, whom the Lord has ordained me to serve, is in great measure, and almost wholly, of a constitution so infirm, that the pressure of even a comparatively light affliction might seriously endanger its well-being; at pres-sent, however, it is smitten with tribulation so overwhelming, that, even were it strong, it could scarcely survive the imposition of the burden. Moreover, when I returned to it recently, I found it offended to a most dangerous degree by my absence; and you, over whose spiritual strength we rejoice in the Lord, can with healthful taste relish and approve the saying of Paul: "Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not ?" 2 I feel this especially because there are many here who by disparaging us attempt to excite against us the minds of the others by whom we seem to be loved, in order that they may make room in them for the devil. But when those whose salvation is our care are angry with us, their strong determination to take vengeance on us is only an unreasonable desire for bringing death to themselves,- not the death of the body, but of the soul, in which the fact of death discovers itself mysteriously by the odour of corruption before it is possible for our care to foresee and provide against it.<br>
    Doubtless you will readily excuse this anxiety on my part, especially because, if you were displeased and wished to punish me, you could perhaps invent no severer pain than what I already suffer in not seeing you at Thagaste. I trust, however, that, assisted by your prayers, I may be permitted when the present hindrance has been removed with all speed to come to you, in whatsoever part of Africa you may be, if this town in which I labour is not worthy (and I do not presume to pronounce it worthy) to be along with us made joyful by your presence.<br>

                          LETTER CXXV. (A.D. 411)<br>
<br>
	TO ALYPIUS, MY LORD MOST BLESSED AND BROTHER BELOVED WITH ALL REVERENCE, AND MY PARTNER IN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE, AND TO THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM, AUGUSTIN AND THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM SEND GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. We are deeply grieved, and can by no means regard it as a small matter, that the people of Hippo clamorously said so much to the disparagement of your Holiness; but, my good brother, their clamorous utterance of these things is not so great a cause for grief as the fact that we are, without open accusation, deemed guilty of similar things. For when we are believed to be actuated in retaining God's servants among us, not by love of righteousness, but by love of money, is it not to be desired that persons who believe this concerning us should with their voices avow what is hidden in their hearts, and so obtain, if possible, remedies great in proportion to the disease, rather than silently perish under the venom of these fatal suspicions ? Wherefore it ought to be a greater care to us (and for this reason we conferred together before this happened) to provide how men to whom we are commanded to be examples in good works may be convinced that there is no ground for suspicions which they cherish, than to provide how those may be rebuked who in words give definite utterance to their suspicions.<br>
    2. Wherefore I am not angry with the pious Albina, nor do I judge her to deserve rebuke; but I think she requires to be cured of such suspicions. It is true that she has not pointed at myself the words to which I refer, but has complained of the people of Hippo, as it were, alleging that their covetousness has been brought to light, and that in desiring to retain among them a man of' wealth who was known to despise money, and to give it away freely, they were moved, not by his fitness for the office, but by regard to his ample means; nevertheless, she almost said openly that she had the same suspicion of myself, and not she only, but also her pious son-in-law and daughter, who, on that very day, said the same thing in the apse of the church.' In my opinion, it is more necessary that the suspicions of these persons should be removed than that their utterance of them should be rebuked. For where can immunity and rest from such thorns be provided and given to us, if they can sprout forth against us even in the hearts of intimate friends, so pious and so much beloved by us ? It is by the ignorant multitude that such things have been thought concerning you, but I am the victim of similar suspicions from those who are the lights of the Church; you may see, therefore, which of us has the greater cause for grief. It seems to me that both cases call, not for invectives, but for remedial measures; for they are men, and their suspicions are of men, and therefore such things as they suspect, though they may be false, are not incredible. Persons such as these are of course not so foolish as to believe that the people are coveting their money, especially after their experience that the people of Thagaste obtained none of their money, from which it was certain that the people of Hippo would also obtain none. Nay, all the violence of this odium comes against the clergy alone, and especially against the bishops, whose authority is visibly pre-eminent, and who are supposed to use and enjoy as owners and lords the property of the Church. My dear Alypius, let not the weak be encouraged through our example to cherish this pernicious and fatal covetousness. Call to mind what we said to each other before the occurrence of this temptation, which makes the duty all the more urgent. Let us rather by God's help endeavour to have this difficulty removed by friendly conference, and let us not count it sufficient to be guided by our own conscience alone; for this is not one of the cases in which its voice alone is sufficient for our direction. For if we be not unworthy servants of our God, if there live in us a spark of that charity which seeketh not her own, we are bound by all means to provide things honest, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of men, lest: while drinking untroubled waters in our own conscience, we be chargeable with treading with incautious feet, and so making the Lord's flock drink from a turbid stream.<br>
    3. For as to the proposal in your letter that we should discuss together the obligation of an oath which has been extorted by force, I beseech you, let not the method of our discussion involve in obscurity things which are perfectly clear. For if inevitable death were threatened in order to compel a servant of God to swear that he would do something forbidden by laws both human and divine, it would be his duty to prefer death to such an oath, lest he should be guilty of a crime in fulfilling his oath. But in this case, in which the determined clamour of the people, and only this, was forcing the man, not to a crime, but to that which if it were done would be lawfully done; when, moreover, there was indeed apprehension lest some reckless men, such as are mixed with a multitude even of good men, should through love of rioting break out into some wicked deeds of violence, if they found a pretext for disturbance and for plausibly justifiable indignation, but<br>
<br>
454<br>
<br>
there was no certainty of this fear being realized, --who will affirm that it is lawful to commit a deliberate act of perjury in order to escape from uncertain consequences, involving, I shall not say loss or bodily injury, but even death itself? Regulus had not heard anything from the Holy Scriptures concerning the impiety of perjury, he had never heard of the flying roll of Zechariah, and he confirmed his oath to the Carthaginians, not by the sacraments of Christ, but by the abominations of false gods; and yet in the face of inevitable tortures, and a death of unprecedented horror, he was not moved by fear so as to swear under constraint, but, because he had given his oath, he of his own free will submitted to these, test he should be guilty of perjury. In that age, also, the Roman censors refused to inscribe in the roll, not of saints inheriting heavenly glory, but of senators received into the curia of Rome, not only men who, through fear of death and of cruel tortures, had chosen rather to commit manifest perjury than to return to merciless enemies, but also one who had believed himself clear of the guilt of perjury, because, after giving his oath, he had under the pretext of alleged necessity violated it by returning; in which we see that those who expelled him from the senate took into consideration, not what he himself had in his mind when he gave his oath, but what those to! whom he pledged his word expected from him. Yet they had never read what we sing continually in the Psalm: "He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not." 2 We are wont to speak of these instances of virtue with the highest admiration, although they are found in men who were strangers to the grace and to the name of Christ; and yet do we seriously imagine that the question whether perjury is occasionally lawful is one for an answer to which we should search the divine books, in which, to prevent us from falling into this sin by inconsiderate oaths, this prohibition is written: "Swear not at all "?<br>
    4. I by no means dispute the perfect correctness of the maxim, that good faith requires an oath to be kept, not according to the mere words of him who gives it, but according to that which the person giving the oath knows to be the expectation of the person to whom he swears. For it is very difficult to define in words, especially in few words, the promise in regard to which security is exacted from him who gives his oath. They, therefore, are guilty of perjury, who, while adhering to the letter of their promise, disappoint the known expectation of those to whom their oath was given; and they are not guilty of perjury, who, even though departing from the letter of the promise, fulfil that which was expected of them when they gave their oath. Wherefore, seeing that the people of Hippo desired to ha.re the holy Pinianus, not as a prisoner who had forfeited liberty, but as a much-loved resident in their town, the limits of that which they expected from him, though it could not be adequately embraced in the words of his promise, are nevertheless so obvious that the fact of his being at this moment absent, after giving his oath to remain among them, does not disturb any one who may have heard that he was to leave this place for a definite purpose, and with the intention of returning. Accordingly, he will not be guilty of perjury, nor will he be regarded by them as violating his oath, unless he disappoint their expectation; and he will not disappoint their expectation, unless he either abandon his purpose of residing among them, or at some future time depart from them without intending to return. May God forbid that he should so depart from the holiness and fidelity which he owes to Christ and to the Church ! For, not to speak of the dread judgment of God upon perjurers, which you know as well as myself, I am perfectly certain that henceforth we shall have no right to be displeased With any one who may refuse to believe what we attest by an oath, if we are found to think that i perjury in such a man as Pinianus is to be not only tolerated without indignation, but actually defended. From this may we be saved by the mercy of Him who delivers from temptation those who put their trust in Him ! Let Pinianus, therefore, as you have written in your communication, fulfil the promise by which he bound himself not to depart from Hippo, just as I myself and the other inhabitants of the town do not depart from it, having, of course, full freedom in going and returning at any time; the only difference being, that those who are not bound by any oath to reside here have it also in their power at any time, without being chargeable with perjury, to depart with no purpose of coming back again.<br>
    5. As to our clergy and the brethren settled in our monastery, I do not know that it can be proved that they either aided or abetted in the 'reproaches which were made against you. For when I inquired into this, I was informed that only one from our monastery, a man of Carthage, had taken part in the clamour of the people; and this was not when they were uttering insults against you, but when they were demanding Pinianus as presbyter.<br>
    I have annexed to this letter a copy of the promise given to him, taken from the very paper which he subscribed and corrected under my own inspection.<br>
<br>
455<br>
<br>
                               LETTER CXXVI.<br>
                                (A.D. 411.)<br>
TO	THE HOLY LADY AND VENERABLE HANDMAID OF GOD ALBINA, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD,<br>
<br>
    I. As to the sorrow of your spirit, which you describe as inexpressible, it becomes me to assuage rather than to augment its bitterness, endeavouring if possible to remove your suspicions, instead of increasing the agitation of one so venerable and so devoted to God by giving vent to indignation because of that which I have suffered in this matter. Nothing was done to our holy brother, your son-in-law Pinianus, by the people of Hippo which might justly awaken in him the fear of death, although, perchance, he himself had such fears. Indeed, we also were apprehensive lest some of the reckless characters who are often secretly banded together for mischief in a crowd might break out into bold acts of violence, finding occasion for beginning a riot with some plausible pretext for passionate excitement. Nothing of this nature, however, was either spoken of or attempted by any one, as I have since had opportunity to ascertain; but against my brother Alypius the people did clamorously utter many opprobrious and unworthy reproaches, for which great sin I desire that they may obtain pardon in answer to his prayers. For my own part, after their outcries began, when I had told them how I was precluded by promise from ordaining him against his will, adding that, if they obtained him as their presbyter through my breaking my word, they could not retain me as their bishop, I left the multitude, and returned to my own seat.' Thereupon, they being made for a little while to pause and waver by my unexpected reply, like a flame driven back for a moment by the wind, began to be much more warmly excited, imagining that possibly a violation of my promise might be extorted from me, or that, in the event of my abiding by my promise, he might be ordained by another bishop. To all to whom I could address myself, namely, to the more venerable and aged men who had come up to me in the apse, I stated that I could not be moved to break my word, and that in the church committed to my care he could not be ordained by any other bishop except with my consent asked and obtained, in granting which I should be no less guilty of a breach of faith. I said, moreover, that if he were ordained against his own will, the people were only wishing him to depart from us as soon as he was ordained. They did not believe that this was possible. But the crowd having gathered in front of the steps, and persisting in the same determination with terrible and incessant clamour and shouting, made them irresolute and perplexed. At that time unworthy reproaches were loudly uttered against my brother Alypius: at that time, also, more serious consequences were apprehended by us.<br>
    2. But although I was much disturbed by so great a commotion among the people, and such trepidation among the office-bearers of the church, I did not say to that mob anything else than that I could not ordain him against his own will; nor after all that had passed was I influenced to do what I had also promised not to do, namely, to advise him m any way to accept the office of presbyter, which had I been able to persuade him to do, his ordination would have been with his consent. I remained faithful to both the promises which I had made, -- not only to the one which I had shortly before intimated to the people, but also to the one in regard to which I was bound, so far as men were concerned, by only one witness. I was faithful, I say, not to an oath, but to my bare promise, even in the face of such danger. It is true that the fears of danger were, as we afterwards ascertained, without foundation; but whatever the danger might be, it was shared by us all alike. The fear was also shared by all; and I myself had thoughts of retiring, being alarmed chiefly for the safety of the building in which we were assembled. But there was reason to apprehend that if I were absent some disaster might be more likely to occur, as the people would then be more exasperated by disappointment, and less restrained by reverential sentiments. Again, if I had gone through the dense mob along with Alypius, I had reason to fear lest some one should dare to lay violent hands on him; if, on the other hand, I had gone without him, what would have been the most natural opinion for men to have formed, if any accident had befallen Alypius, and I appeared to have deserted him in order to hand him over to the power of an infuriated people?<br>
    3. In the midst of this excitement and great distress, when, being at our wit's end, we could not, so to speak, take breath, behold our pious son Pinianus, suddenly and quite unexpectedly, sends to me a servant of God, to tell me that he wished to swear to the people, that if he were ordained against his will he would leave Africa altogether, thinking, I believe, that the people, knowing that of course he could not violate his oath, would not continue their outcry, seeing that by perseverance they could gain nothing, but only drive from among us a man whom we ought at least to retain as a neighbour, if he was to be no more. As it seemed to me, however, that it was to be feared that the vehemence of the people's grief would be increased by his<br>
<br>
456<br>
<br>
taking an oath of this kind, I was silent in regard to it; and as he had by the same messenger begged me to come to him, I went without delay. When he had said to me again what he had stated by the messenger, he immediately added to the same oath what he had sent another messenger to.intimate to me while I was hastening towards him, namely, that he would consent to reside in Hippo if no one compelled him to accept against his will the burden of the clerical office. On this, being comforted in my perplexities as by a breath of air when in danger of suffocation, I made no reply, but went with quickened pace to my brother Alypius, and told him what Pinianus had said. But he, being careful, I suppose, lest anything should be done with his sanction by which he thought you might. be offended, said, "Let no one ask my opinion on this subject." Having heard this, I hastened to the noisy crowd, and having obtained silence, declared to them what had been promised, along with the proffered guarantee of an oath. The people, however, having no other thought or desire than that he should be their presbyter, did not receive the proposal as I had expected they would, but, after talking in an under-tone among themselves, made the request that to this promise and oath a clause might be added, that if at any time he should be pleased to consent to accept the clerical office, he should do so in no other church than that of Hippo. I reported this to him: without hesitation he agreed to it. I returned to them with his answer; they were filled with joy, and presently demanded the promised oath.<br>
    4. I came back to your son-in-law, and found him at a loss as to the words in which his promise, confirmed by oath, could be expressed, because of various kinds of necessity which might emerge and might make it necessary for him to leave Hippo. He stated at the time what he feared, namely, that a hostile incursion of barbarians might occur, to avoid which it would be necessary to leave the place. The holy Melania wished to add also, as a possible reason for departure, the unhealthiness of the climate; but she was kept from this by his reply. I said, however, that he had brought forward an important reason deserving consideration, and one which, if it occurred, would compel the citizens themselves to abandon the place; but that, if this reason were stated to the people, we might justly fear lest they should regard us as prophet-saying evil, and, on the other hand, if a pretext for withdrawing from the promise were put under the general name of necessity, it might be thought that the necessity was only covering an intention to deceive. It seemed good to him, therefore, that we should test the feeling of the people in regard to this, and we found the result exactly as I had expected. For when the words which he had dictated were read by the deacon, and had been received with approbation, as soon as the clause concerning necessity which might hinder the fulfilment of his promise fell upon their ears, there arose at once a shout of remonstrance, and the promise was rejected; and the tumult began to break out again, the people thinking that these negotiations had no other object than to deceive them. When our pious son saw this, he ordered the clause regarding necessity to be struck out, and the people recovered their cheerfulness once more.<br>
    5. I would gladly have excused myself on the ground of fatigue, but he would not go to the people unless I accompanied him; so we went together. He told them that he had himself dictated what they had heard from the deacon, that he had confirmed the promise by an oath, and would do the things promised, after which he forthwith rehearsed all in the words which he had dictated. The response of the people was, "Thanks be unto God !" and they begged that all which was written should be subscribed. We dismissed the catechumens, and he adhibited his signature to the document at once. Then we [Alypius and myself] began to be urged, not by the voices of the crowd, but by faithful men of good report as their representatives, that we also as bishops should subscribe the writing. But when I began to do this, the pious Melania protested against it. I wondered why she did this so late, as if we could make his promise and oath void by forbearing from appending our names to it; I obeyed, however, and so my signature remained incomplete, and no one thought it necessary to insist further upon our subscription.<br>
    6. I have been at pains to communicate to your Holiness, so far as I thought sufficient, what were the feelings, or rather the remarks, of the people on the following day, when they heard that he had left the town. Whoever, therefore, may have told you anything contradicting what I stated, is either intentionally or through his own mistake misleading you. For I am aware that I passed over some things which seemed to me irrelevant, but I know that I said nothing but the truth. It is therefore true that our holy son Pinianus took his oath in my presence and with my permission, but it is not true that he did it in obedience to any command from me. He himself knows this:it is also known to those servants of God whom he sent to me, the first being the pious Barnabas, the second Timasius, by whom also he sent me the promise of his remaining in Hippo. As for the people themselves, moreover, they were urging him by their cries to accept the office of presbyter. They did not ask for his oath, but they did not<br>
<br>
457<br>
<br>
refuse it when offered, because they hoped that if he remained amongst us, there might be produced in him a willingness to consent to ordination, while they feared lest, if ordained against his will, he should, according to his oath, leave Africa. And therefore they also were actuated in their clamorous procedure by regard to God's ' work (for surely the consecration of a presbyter is a work of God); and inasmuch as they did not feel satisfied with his promise of remaining in Hippo, unless it were also promised that, in the event of his at any time accepting the clerical office, he should do it nowhere else than among them, it is perfectly manifest what they hoped for from his dwelling among them, and that they did not abandon their zeal for the work of God.<br>
    7. On what ground, then, do you allege that the people did this out of a base desire for money ? In the first place, the people who were so clamorous have nothing whatever of this kind to gain; for as the people of Thagaste derive from the gifts which you have bestowed on their church no profit but the joy of seeing your good work, it will be the same in the case of the people of Hippo, or of any other place in which you have obeyed or may yet obey the law of your Lord concerning the "mammon of unrighteousness." The people, therefore, in most vehemently insisting upon guiding the procedure of their church in regard to so great a man, did not ask from you a pecuniary advantage, but testified their admiration for your contempt of, money. For if in my own case, because they had heard that, despising my patrimony, which i consisted of only a few small fields, I had consecrated myself to the liberty of serving God, they loved this disinterestedness, and did not grudge this gift to the church of my birthplace, Thagaste, but, when it had not imposed upon me the clerical office, made me by force, so to speak, their own, how much more ardently might they love in our Pinianus his overcoming and treading under foot with such remarkable decision riches so great and hopes so bright, and a strong natural capacity for enjoying this world ! I indeed seem, in the opinion of many, who compare' themselves with themselves, to have rather found than forsaken wealth. For my patrimony can j scarcely be considered a twentieth part of the ecclesiastical property which I am now supposed to possess as master. But in whatever church, especially in Africa, our Pinianus might be ordained (I do not say a presbyter, but) a bishop, he would be still in deep poverty compared with his former affluence, even if he were using the church's revenues in the spirit of one lording it over God's heritage. Christian poverty is much more clearly and certainly loved in the case of one in whom there is no room for suspecting a desire for acquiring an accession to his wealth. It was this admiration which kindled the minds of the people, and roused them to such violence of persevering clamour. Let us therefore not charge them gratuitously with base covetousness, but rather, without imputing unworthy motives, allow them at least to love in others that good thing which they do not themselves possess, For although there may have mixed in the crowd some who are indigent or beggars, who helped to increase the clamour, and were actuated by the hope of some relief to their wants out of your honourable affluence, even this is not, in my opinion, base covetousness.<br>
    8. It remains, therefore, that the reproach of disgraceful covetousness must be levelled indirectly at the clergy, and especially at the bishop. For we are supposed to act as lords of the church's property; we are supposed to enjoy its revenues. In short, whatever money we have received for the church either is still in our possession or has been spent according to our judgment; and of it we have given nothing to any of the people besides the clergy and the brethren in the monastery, excepting only a very few indigent persons. I do not mean by this to say that the things which were said by you must necessarily have been said specially against us, but that, if said against any others than ourselves, they must have been incredible. What, then, shall we do ? If it be not possible to clear ourselves before enemies, by what means may we at least clear ourselves before you ? The matter is one pertaining to the soul; it is within us, hidden from the eyes of men, and known to God alone. What, then, remains for us but to call to witness God, to whom it is known ? When, therefore, you harbour these suspicions concerning us, you do not command but absolutely compel us to give our oath,--a much more grievous wrong than the commanding of an oath, which you have thought proper in your letter to censure as highly culpable in me; you compel us, I say, not by menacing death to the body, as the people of Hippo were supposed to have done, but by menacing death to our good name, which deserves to be regarded by us as more precious than life itself, for the sake of those weak brethren to whom we endeavour in all circumstances to exhibit ourselves as ensamples in good works.<br>
    9. We, however, are not indignant against you who compel us to this oath, as you are indignant against the people of Hippo. For you believe, as men judging of other men, things which, though not actually existing in us, might possibly have existed. Your suspicions we must labour not so much to reprove as to remove; and since our conscience is clear in the sight of God,<br>
<br>
458<br>
<br>
we must seek to clear our character in your sight. It may be, as Alypius and I said to each other before this trial occurred, that God will grant that not only you, our much-beloved fellow-members of Christ's body, but even our most implacable enemies, may be thoroughly satisfied that we are not defiled by any love of money in our administration of ecclesiastical affairs. Until this be done (if the Lord, answering our prayer, permit it to be done), hear in the meantime what we are compelled to do, rather than put off for any length of time the healing of your heart. God is my witness that, as for the whole management of those ecclesiastical revenues over which we are supposed to love to exercise lordship, I only bear it as a burden which is imposed on me by love to the brethren and fear of God: I do not love it; nay, if I could, without unfaithfulness to my office, I would desire to be rid of it. God also is my witness that I believe the sentiments of Alypius to be the same as mine in this matter. Nevertheless, on the one hand, the people, and what is worse, the people of Hippo, have hastily done Alypius great wrong by entertaining another opinion of his character; and on the other hand, you who are saints of God and full of unfeigned compassion have, through believing such things concerning us, thought proper to touch and admonish us while nominally censuring the same people of Hippo, who have no part whatever in the guilt of the alleged covetousness. You have desired unqUestionably to correct us, and that without hating us (this be far from you !); wherefore I ought not to be angry with you, but to thank you, because it was not possible for you to have combined modesty and freedom more happily than when, instead of stating your sentiments as an offensive accusation against the bishop, you left them to be discovered by indirect inferences.<br>
    10. Let not the fact that I have thought it necessary thus to confirm my statements by oath cause you vexation by making you think that you are treated with harshness. There was no hardness or lack of kindly feeling in the apostle towards those to whom he wrote: "Neither used we at any time flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness." In the thing which was opened to men's observation he appealed to their own testimony, but in regard to that which was hidden, to whom could he appeal but to God ? If, therefore, fear lest the ignorance of men should make them entertain some such thoughts concerning him was reasonably felt even by Paul, whose labours, as all men knew, were such that except in extreme necessity he never took anything for his own benefit from the communities to which he dispensed the grace of Christ, obtaining in all other cases the necessary provision for his support by working with his own hands, how much more pains must be taken to establish confidence in our disinterestedness by us, who are, both in the merit of holiness and in strength of mind, so far behind him, and who are not only unable to do anything by the work of our hands to support ourselves, but also precluded from this, even if we could work, by an accumulation of duties from which I believe that the apostles were exempt ! Let the charge, therefore, of most base covetousness be brought no more in this matter against the Christian people- that is, the Church of Christ. For it is more tolerable that this charge be alleged against us, on whom the suspicion, though groundless, might fall without being utterly improbable, than on the people, of whom it is certainly known that they could not either cherish the covetous desire or be reasonably suspected of entertaining it.<br>
    11. For persons possessing any faith land how much more the Christian faith!To be unfaithful to their oath, I do not say by doing something contrary to it, but by hesitating at all as to its fulfilment, is utterly wrong. What my judgment is on this question I have with sufficient fulness declared in the letter which I sent to my brother Alypius. Your Holiness wrote asking me "whether I or the people of Hippo consider any one under obligation to fulfil an oath which has been extorted by violence." But what is your opinion ? Do you think that even if death, which in this case was feared without reason, were certainly imminent, a Christian might use the name of his Lord to confirm a lie, and call his God to be witness to a falsehood ? For assuredly a Christian, if urged by the menace of instant death to perjure himself by false testimony, ought to fear the loss of hon-our more than the loss of life. Hostile armies confront each other in the battle-field with mutual menaces of death, about which there can be no uncertainty; and yet, when they pledge themselves to each other by oath, we praise those who are faithful to their engagement, and we justly abhor those who are unfaithful. Now what was the motive leading them to swear to each other, but the fear on both sides of being killed or taken prisoners ? And by this promise even such men hold themselves bound, lest they be guilty of sacrilege and perjury if they did not . fulfil the oath extorted by the fear of death or captivity, and broke the promise given in such circumstances: they are more afraid of breaking their oath than of taking a man's life. And do we propose to discuss as a debatable question whether an oath must be fulfilled which has been given under fear of harm by servants of God, who are under pre-eminent obligations to holi-<br>
459<br>
<br>
ness, by monks who are running the race towards Christian perfection, by distributing their property according to Christ's command?<br>
    12. Tell me, I beseech you, what hardship deserving the name of exile, or transportation, or banishment, is involved in his promise to reside: here ? I suppose that the office of presbyter is: not exile. Would our Pinianus prefer exile to! that office ? Far be it from us to find such apology for one who is a saint of God and very dear to us: God forbid, I say, that it should be said of him that he preferred exile to the office of presbyter, and preferred to perjure himself rather than submit to exile. This I would say even if it were true that the oath by which he promised to reside among us had been extorted from him but the fact is that, instead of being extorted in spite of his refusal, it was accepted when he had proffered it himself. It was accepted, moreover, as I have already said, because of the hope, which was encouraged by his remaining here, that he might also consent to comply with our desire that he should accept the clerical office. In fine, whatever opinion may be entertained concerning us or concerning the people of Hippo, the case of those who may have compelled him to take the oath is very different from that of those who may have -- I do not say compelled, but at least- counselled him to break the oath. I trust, also, that Pinianus himself will not refuse to consider seriously whether it is worse to swear under the pressure of fear, however great, or, in the absence of all alarm, to commit deliberate perjury.<br>
    13. God be thanked that the men of Hippo regard his promise of residence here as kept fully, if only he come with the intention of making this town his home, and in going whithersoever necessity may call him, go with the intention of coming back to us again. For if they were to exact literal fulfilment of the words of the promise, it would be the duty of a servant of God to adhere to every sentence of it rather than forswear himself. But as it would be a crime for them so to bind any one, much more such a man as he is, so they have themselves proved that they had no such unreasonable expectation; for on hearing that he had gone away with the intention of returning, they expressed their satisfaction; and fidelity to an oath requires no more than the performance of what was expected by those to whom it was given. Let me ask, moreover, what is meant by saying that he, in giving the oath with his own lips, mentioned the possibility of necessity preventing his fulfilment of the promise ? The truth is, that with his own lips he ordered the qualifying clause to be removed. If he put it in, it would be when he himself spoke to the people; but! if he had done so, they assuredly would not have answered, "Thanks be unto God," but would have renewed the protestations which they made when it was read with the qualifying clause by the deacon. And what difference does it really make whether this plea of necessity for departing from the promise was or was not inserted ? Nothing more than we have stated above was expected from him; but he who disappoints the known expectation of those to whom his oath is given, cannot but be a perjured person.<br>
    14. Wherefore, let his promise be fulfilled, and let the hearts of the weak be healed, lest, on the one hand, those who approve of it be taught by such a conspicuous example to imitate an act of perjury, and lest, on the other hand, those who condemn it have just grounds for saying that none of us is worthy to be believed, not only when we make promises, but even when we give our oath. Let us especially guard against giving occasion in this to the tongues of enemies, which are used by the great Enemy as darts wherewith to slay the weak. But God forbid that we should expect from a man like Pinianus anything else than what the fear of God inspires, and the superior excellence of his own piety approves. As for myself, whom you blame for not interfering to forbid his oath, I admit that I could not bring myself to believe that, in circumstances so disorderly and scandalous, I ought rather to allow the church which I serve to be overthrown, than accept the deliverance which was offered to us by such a man.<br>

                                (A.D. 412.)<br>
	TO PROBA,1 A DEVOTED HANDMAID OF GOD, BISHOP AUGUSTIN, A SERVANT OF CHRIST AND OF CHRIST'S SERVANTS, SENDS GREETING IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OF LORDS.<br>
<br>
               CHAP. I.-- I. Recollecting your request and<br>
my promise, that as soon as time and opportunity should be given by Him to whom we pray, I would write you something on the sub-<br>
<br>
                                    460<br>
<br>
ject of prayer to God, I feel it my duty now to discharge this debt, and in the love of Christ to minister to the satisfaction of your pious desire. I cannot express in words how greatly I rejoiced because of the request, in which I perceived how great is your solicitude about this supremely important matter. For what could be more suitably the business of your widowhood than to continue in supplications night and day, according to the apostle's admonition, "She that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications night and day"?' It might, indeed, appear wonderful that solicitude about prayer should occupy your heart and claim the first place in it, when you are, so far as this world is concerned, noble and wealthy, and the mother of such an illustrious family, and, although a widow, not desolate, were it not that you wisely understand that in this world and in this life the soul has no sure portion.<br>
    2. Wherefore He who inspired you with this thought is assuredly doing what He promised to His disciples when they were grieved, not for themselves, but for the whole human family, and were despairing of the salvation of any one, after they heard from Him that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. He gave them this marvellous and merciful reply: "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."' He, therefore, with whom it is possible to make even the rich enter into the kingdom of heaven, inspired you with that devout anxiety which makes you think it necessary to ask my counsel on the question how you ought to pray. For while tie was yet on earth, He brought Zaccheus,3 though rich, into the kingdom of heaven, and, after being glorified in His resurrection and ascension, He made many who were rich to despise this present world, and made them more truly rich by extinguishing their desire for riches through His imparting to them His Holy Spirit. For how could you desire so much to pray to God if you did not trust in Him? And how could you trust in Him if you were fixing your trust in uncertain riches, and neglecting the wholesome exhortation of the apostle: "Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation, that they may lay hold on eternal life" ? 4<br>
<br>
    CHAP. II.-- 3. It becomes you, therefore, out of love to this true life, to account yourself "desolate" in this world, however great the prosperity of your lot may be. For as that is the true life, in comparison with which the present life, which is much loved, is not worthy to be called life, however happy and prolonged it be, so is it also the true consolation promised by the Lord in the words of Isaiah, "I will give him the true consolation, peace upon peace," s without which consolation men find themselves, in the midst of every mere earthly solace, rather desolate than comforted. For as for riches and high rank, and all other things in which men who are strangers to true felicity imagine that happiness exists, what comfort do they bring, seeing that it is better to be independent of such things than to enjoy abundance of them, because, when possessed, they occasion, through our fear of losing them, more vexation than was caused by the strength of desire with which their possession was coveted ? Men are not made good by possessing these so-called good things, but, if men have become good otherwise, they make these things to be really good by using them well. Therefore true comfort is to be found not in them, but rather in those things in which true life is found. For a man can be made blessed only by the same power by which he is made good.<br>
    4. It is true, indeed, that good men are seen to be the sources of no small comfort to others in this world. For if we be harassed by poverty, or saddened by bereavement, or disquieted by bodily pain, or pining in exile, or vexed by any kind of calamity, let good men visit us, men who can not only rejoice with them that !rejoice, but also weep with them that weep,6 and who know how to give profitable counsel, and win us to express our feelings in conversation: the effect is, that rough things become smooth, heavy burdens are lightened, and difficulties vanquished most wonderfully. But this is done in and through them by Him who has made them good by His Spirit. On the other hand, although riches may abound, and no bereavement befal us, and health of body be enjoyed, and we live in our own country in peace and safety, if, at the same time, we have as our neighbours wicked men, among whom there is not one who can be trusted, not one from whom we do not apprehend and experience treachery, deceit, outbursts of anger, dissensions, and snares, in such a case are not all these other things made bitter and vexatious, so that nothing sweet or pleasant is left in them? Whatever, therefore, be our circumstances in this world, there is nothing truly enjoyable without a friend. But how<br>
<br>
461<br>
<br>
rarely is one found in this life about whose spirit and behaviour as a true friend there may be perfect confidence! For no one is known to another so intimately as he is known to himself, and yet no one is so well known even to himself that he can be sure as to his own conduct on the morrow; wherefore, although many are known by their fruits, and some gladden their neighhours by their good lives, while others grieve their neighbours by their evil lives, yet the minds of men are so unknown and so unstable, that there is the highest wisdom in the exhortation of the apostle: "Judge nothing before the time until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God."'<br>
    5. In the darkness, then, of this world, in which we are pilgrims absent from the Lord as long as "we walk by faith and not by sight,"2 the Christian soul ought to feel itself desolate, and continue in prayer, and learn to fix the eye of faith on the word of the divine sacred Scriptures, as "on a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in our hearts."3 For the ineffable source from which this lamp borrows its light is the Light which shineth in darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not- the Light, in order to seeing which our hearts must be purified by faith; for "blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; "4 and "we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, foe we shall see Him as He is." 5 Then after death shall come the true life, and after desolation the true consolation, that life shall deliver our "souls from death "that consolation shall deliver our "eyes from tears," and, as follows in the psalm, our feet shall be delivered from falling; for there shall be no temptation there.6 Moreover, if there be no temptation, there will be no prayer; for there we shall not be waiting for promised blessings,: but contemplating the blessings actually bestowed; wherefore he adds, "I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living," 7 where we shall then be--not in the wilderness of the dead, where we now are: "For ye are dead," says the apostle, "and your life is hid with Christ in God; when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory." s For that is the true life on which the rich are exhorted to lay hold by being rich in good works; and in it is the true consolation, for want of which, meanwhile, a widow is "desolate" indeed, even though she has sons and grandchildren, and conducts her household piously, entreating all dear to her to put their hope in God: and in the midst of all this, she says in her prayer, "My soul thirsteth for Thee; my flesh longeth in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;" 9 and this dying life is nothing else than such a land, however numerous our mortal comforts, however pleasant our companions in the pilgrimage, and however great the abundance of our possessions. You know how uncertain all these things are; and even if they were not uncertain, what would they be in comparison with the felicity which is promised in the life to come !<br>
    6. In saying these things to you, who, being a widow, rich and noble, and the mother of an illustrious family, have asked from me a discourse on prayer, my aim has been to make you feel that, even while your family are spared to you, and live as you would desire, you are desolate so long as you have not attained to that life in which is the true and abiding consolation, in which shall be fulfilled what is spoken in prophecy: "We are satisfied in the morning with Thy mercy, we rejoice and are glad all our days; we are made glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil." ,o<br>
    CHAP. III.-- 7. Wherefore, until that consolation come, remember, in order to your "continuing in prayers and supplications night and day," that, however great the temporal prosperity may be which flows around you, you are desolate. For the apostle does not ascribe this gift to every widow, but to her who, being a widow indeed, and desolate, "trusteth in God, and continueth in supplication night and day." Observe, however, most vigilantly the warning which follows: "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth;" ,2 for a person lives in those things which he loves, which he greatly desires, and in which he believes himself to be blessed. Wherefore, what Scripture has said of riches: "If riches increase, set not your heart upon them,"12 I say to you concerning pleasures: "If pleasures increase, set not your heart upon them." Do not, therefore,'think highly of yourself because these things are not wanting, but are yours abundantly, flowing, as it were, from a most copious fountain of earthly felicity. 'By all means look upon your possession of these things with indifference and contempt, and seek nothing from them beyond health of body. For this is a blessing not to be despised, because of its being necessary to the work of life until "this mortal<br>
<br>
462<br>
<br>
shall have put on immortality"1 in other words, the true, perfect, and everlasting health, which is neither reduced by earthly infirmities nor repaired by corruptible gratification, but, enduring with celestial rigour, is animated with a life eternally incorruptible. For the apostle himself says, "Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof," 2 because we must take care of the flesh, but only in so far as is necessary for health; "For no man ever yet hated his own flesh,"3 as he himself likewise says. Hence, also, he admonished Timothy, who was, as it appears, too severe upon his body, that he should "use a little wine for his stomach's sake, and for his often infirmities." 4<br>
    8. Many holy men and women, using every precaution against those pleasures in which she that liveth, cleaving to them, and dwelling in them as her heart's delight, is dead while she liveth, have cast from them that which is as it were the mother of pleasures, by distributing their wealth among the poor, and so have stored it in the safer keeping of the treasury of heaven. If you are hindered from doing this by some consideration of duty to your family, you know yourself what account you can give to God of your use of riches. For no one knoweth what passeth within a man, "but the spirit of the man which is in him." s We ought not to judge anything "before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God." 6 It pertains, therefore, to your care as a widow, to see to it that if pleasures increase you do not set your heart upon them, lest that which ought to rise that it may live, die through contact with their corrupting influence. Reckon yourself to be one of those of whom it is written, "Their hearts shall live for ever." 7<br>
    CHAP. IV. -- 9. You have now heard what manner of person you should be if you would pray; hear, in the next place, what you ought to pray for. This is the subject on which you have thought it most necessary to ask my opinion, because you were disturbed by the words of the apostle: "We know not what we should pray for as we ought;"8 and you became alarmed lest it should do you more harm to pray otherwise than you ought, than to desist from praying altogether. A short solution of your difficulty may be given thus: "Pray for a happy life." This all men wish to have; for even those whose lives are worst and most abandoned would by no means live thus, unless they thought that in this way they either were made or might be made truly happy. Now what else ought we to pray for than that which both bad and good desire, but which only the good obtain ?<br>
    CHAP. V. -- 10. You ask, perchance, What is this happy life? On this question the talents and leisure of many philosophers have been wasted, who, nevertheless, failed in their researches after it just in proportion as they failed to honour Him from whom it proceeds, and were unthankful to Him. In the first place, then, consider whether we should accept the opinion of those philosophers who pronounce that man happy who lives according to his own will. Far be it, surely, from us to believe this; for what if a man's will inclines him to live in wickedness ? Is he not proved to be a miserable man in proportion to the facility with which his depraved will is carried out ? Even philosophers who were strangers to the worship of God have rejected this sentiment with deserved abhorrence. One of them, a man of the greatest eloquence, says: "Behold, however, others, not philosophers indeed, but men of ready power in disputation, who affirm that all men are happy who live according to their own will. But this is certainly untrue, for to wish that which is unbecoming is itself a most miserable thing; nor is it so miserable a thing to fail in obtaining what you wish as to wish to obtain what you ought not to desire."9 What is your opinion? Are not these words, by whomsoever they are spoken, derived from the Truth itself? We may therefore here say what the apostle said of a certain Cretan poet10 whose sentiment had pleased him: "This witness is true."<br>
    11. He, therefore, is truly happy who has all that he wishes to have, and wishes to have nothing which he ought not to wish. This being understood, let us now observe what things men may without impropriety wish to have. One desires marriage; another, having become a widower, chooses thereafter to live a life of continence; a third chooses to practise continence though he is married. And although of these three conditions one may be found better than another, we cannot say that any one of the three persons is wishing what he ought not: the same is true of the desire for children as the fruit of marriage, and for life and health to be enjoyed by the children who have been received,- of which desires the latter is one with which widows remaining unmarried are for the most part occupied; for although, refusing a second marriage, they do not now wish to have children, they wish that the children that they have may live in<br>
<br>
463<br>
<br>
health. From all such care those who preserve their virginity intact are free. Nevertheless, all have some dear to them whose temporal welfare they do without impropriety desire. But when men have obtained this health for themselves, and for those whom they love, are we at liberty to say that they are now happy ? They have, it is true, something which it is quite becoming to desire; but if they have not other things which are greater, better, and more full both of utility and beauty, they are still far short of possessing a happy life.<br>
    CHAP. VI. -- 12. Shall we then say, that in addition to this health of body men may desire for themselves and for those dear to them honour and power? By all means, if they desire these in order that by obtaining them they may promote the interest of those who may be their dependants. If they seek these things not for the sake of the things themselves, but for some good thing which may through this means be accomplished, the wish is a proper one; but if it be merely for the empty gratification of pride, and arrogance, and for a superfluous and pernicious triumph of vanity, the wish is improper. Wherefore, men do nothing wrong in desiring for themselves and for their kindred the competent portion of necessary things, of which the apostle speaks when he says: "Godliness with a competency [contentment in English version] is great gain; for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out: and having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition; for the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."1 This competent portion he desires without impropriety who desires it and nothing beyond it; for if his desires go beyond it, he is not desiring it, and therefore his desire is improper. This was desired, and was prayed for by him who said: "Give me neither poverty nor riches: feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full, and deny Thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain."2 You see assuredly that this competency is desired not for its own sake, but to secure the health of the body, and such provision of house and clothing as is befitting the man's circumstances, that he may appear as he ought to do among those amongst whom he has lo live, so as to retain their respect and discharge the duties of his position.<br>
<br>
    13. Among all these things, our own welfare and the benefits which friendship bids us ask for others are things to be desired on their own account; but a competency of the necessaries of life is usually sought, if it be sought in the proper way, not on its own account, but for the sake of the two higher benefits. Welfare consists in the possession of life itself, and health and soundness of mind and body. The claims of friendship, moreover, are not to be confined within tao narrow range, for it embraces all to whom love and kindly affection are due, although the heart goes out to some of these more freely, to others more cautiously; yea, it even extends to our enemies, for whom also we are commanded to pray. There is accordingly no one in the whole human family to whom kindly affection is not due by reason of the bond of a common humanity, although it may not be due on the ground of reciprocal love; Chap. vii.--but in those by whom we are requited with a holy and pure love, we find great and reasonable pleasure.<br>
    For these things, therefore, it becomes us to pray: if we have them, that we may keep them; if we have them not, that we may get them.<br>
    14. Is this all? Are these the benefits in which exclusively the happy life is found? Or does truth teach us that something else is to be preferred to them all ? We know that both the competency of things necessary, and the well-being of ourselves and of our friends, so long as these concern this present world alone, are to be cast aside as dross in comparison with the obtaining of eternal life; for although the body may be in health, the mind cannot be regarded as sound which does not prefer eternal to temporal things; yea, tim life which we live in time is wasted, if it be not spent in obtaining that by which we may be worthy of eternal life. Therefore all things which are the objects of useful and becoming desire are unquestionably to be viewed with reference to that one life which is lived with God, and is derived from Him. In so doing, we love ourselves if we love God; and we truly love our neighbours as ourselves, according to the second great commandment, if, so far as is in our power, we persuade them to a similar love of God. We love God, therefore, for what He is in Himself, and ourselves and our neighbours for His sake. Even when living thus, let us not think that we are securely established in that happy life, as if there was nothing more for which we should still pray. For how could we be said to live a happy life now, while that which alone is the object of a well-directed life is still wanting to us?<br>
    CHAP. VIII. -- 15. Why, then, are our desires scattered over many things, and why, through fear of not praying as we ought, do we ask what we should pray for, and not rather say<br>
<br>
464<br>
<br>
with the Psalmist: "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple "?z For in the house of the Lord "all the days of life" are not days distinguished by their successively coming and passing away: the beginning of one day is not the end of another; but they are all alike unending in that place where the life which is made up of them has itself no end. In order to our obtaining this true blessed life, He who is Himself the True Blessed Life has taught us to pray, not with much speaking, as if our being heard depended upon the fluency with which we express ourselves, seeing that we are praying to One who, as the Lord tells us, "knoweth what things we have need of before we ask Him.", Whence it may seem surprising that, although He has forbidden "much speaking," He who knoweth before we ask Him what things we need has nevertheless given us exhortation to prayer in such words as these: "Men ought always to pray and not to faint;" setting before us the case of a widow, who, desiring to have justice done to her against her adversary, did by her persevering entreaties persuade an unjust judge to listen to her, not moved by a regard either to justice or to mercy, but overcome by her wearisome importunity; in order that we might be admonished bow much more certainly the Lord God, who is merciful and just, gives ear to us praying continually to Him, when this widow, by her unremitting supplication, prevailed over the indifference of an unjust and wicked judge, and how willingly and benignantly He fulfils the good desires of those whom He knows to have forgiven others their trespasses, when this suppliant, though seeking vengeance upon her adversary, obtained her desire.3 A similar lesson the Lord gives in the parable of the man to whom a friend in his journey had come, and who, having nothing to set before him, desired to borrow from another friend three loaves (in which, perhaps, there is a figure of the Trinity of persons of one substance), and finding him already along with his household asleep, succeeded by very urgent and importunate entreaties in rousing him up, so! that he gave him as many as he needed, being moved rather by a wish to avoid further annoyance than by benevolent thoughts: from which! the Lord would have us understand that, if even one who was asleep is constrained to give, even in spite of himself, after being disturbed in his sleep by the person who asks of him, how much more kindly will He give who never sleeps, and who rouses us from sleep that we may ask from Him.4<br>
<br>
    16. With the same design He added: "Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent ? or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give good things to them that ask Him ?" s We have here what corresponds to those three things which the apostle commends: faith is signified by 'the fish, either on account of the element of water used in baptism, or because it remains unharmed amid the tempestuous waves of this world,contrasted with which is the serpent, that with poisonous deceit persuaded man to disbelieve God; hope is signified by the egg, because the life of the young bird is not yet in it, but is to be is not seen, but hoped for, because "hope which is seen is not hope," 6 -- contrasted with which is the scorpion, for the man who hopes for eternal life forgets the things which are behind, and reaches forth to the things which are before, for to him it is dangerous to look back; but the scorpion is to be guarded against on account of what it has in its tail, namely, a sharp and venomous sting; charity, is signified by bread, for "the greatest of these is charity," and bread surpasses all other kinds of food in usefulness, --contrasted with which is a stone, because hard hearts refuse to exercise charity. Whether this be the meaning of these symbols, or some other more suitable be found, it is at least certain that He who knoweth how to give good gifts to His children urges us to "ask and seek and knock."<br>
    17. Why .this should be done by Him who "before we ask Him knoweth what things we have need of," might perplex our minds, if we did not understand that the Lord our God requires us to ask not that thereby our wish may be intimated to Him, for to Him it cannot be unknown, but in order that by prayer there may be exercised in us by supplications that desire by which we may receive what He prepares to bestow. His gifts are very great, but we are small and straitened in our capacity of receiving. Wherefore it is said to us: "Be ye enlarged, not bearing the yoke along with unbelievers. 7 For, in proportion to the simplicity of our faith, the firmness of our hope, and the ardour of our desire, will we more largely receive of that which is immensely great; which "eye hath not seen,"<br>
<br>
465<br>
<br>
for it is not colour; which "the ear hath not heard," for it is not sound; and which hath not ascended into the heart of man, for the heart of man must ascend to it.1<br>
    CHAP. IX -- 18. When we cherish uninterrupted desire along with the exercise of faith and hope and charity, we "pray always." But at certain stated hours and seasons we also use. words in prayer to God, that by these signs of things we may admonish ourselves, and may acquaint ourselves with the measure of progress which we have made in this desire, and may more warmly excite ourselves to obtain an increase of its strength. For the effect following upon prayer will be excellent in proportion to the fen, our of the desire which precedes its utterance. And therefore, what else is intended by the words of the apostle: "Pray without ceasing," 2 than," Desire without intermission, from Him who alone can give it, a happy life, which no life can be but that which is eternal "? This, therefore, let us desire continually from the Lord our God; and thus let us pray continually. But at certain hours we recall our minds from other cares and business, in which desire itself somehow is cooled down, to the business of prayer, admonishing ourselves by the words of our prayer to fix attention upon that which we desire, lest what had begun to lose heat become altogether cold, and be finally extinguished, if the flame be not more frequently fanned. Whence, also, when the same apostle says, "Let your requests be made known unto God," 3 this is not to be understood as if thereby they become known to God, who certainly knew them before they were uttered, but in this sense, that they are to be made known to ourselves in the presence of God by patient waiting upon Him, not in the presence of men by ostentatious worship. Or perhaps that they may be made known also to the angels that are in the presence of God, that these beings may in some way present them to God, and consult Him concerning them, and may bring to us, either manifestly or secretly, that which, hearkening to His commandment, they may have learned to be His will, and which must be fulfilled by them according to that which they have there learned to be their duty; for the angel said to Tobias:4 "Now, therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter-in-law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One."<br>
    CHAP. X. -- 19. Wherefore it is neither wrong ! nor unprofitable to spend much time in praying, if there be leisure for this without hindering other good and necessary works to which duty' calls us, although even in the doing of these, as I have said, we ought by cherishing holy desire to pray without ceasing. For to spend a long time in prayer is not, as some think, the same thing as to pray "with much speaking." Multiplied words are one thing, long-continued warmth of desire is another. For even of the Lord Himself it is written, that He continued all night in prayer,s and that His prayer was more prolonged when He was in an agony; and in this is not an example given to us by Him who is in time an Intercessor such as we need, and who is with the Father eternally the Hearer of prayer ?<br>
 20. The brethren in Egypt are reported to 'have very frequent prayers, but these very brief, and, as it were, sudden and ejaculatory, lest the wakeful and aroused attention which is indispensable in prayer should by protracted exercises vanish or lose its keenness. And in this they themselves show plainly enough, that just as this attention is not to be allowed to become exhausted if it cannot continue long, so it is not to be suddenly suspended if it is sustained. Far be it from us either to use "much speaking" in prayer, or to refrain from prolonged prayer, if fervent attention of the soul continue. To use much speaking in prayer is to employ a superfluity of words in asking a necessary thing; but to prolong prayer is to have the heart throbbing with continued pious emotion towards Him to whom we pray. For in most cases prayer consists more in groaning than in speaking, in tears rather than in words. But He setteth our tears in His sight, and our groaning is not hidden from Him who made all things by the word, and does not need human words.<br>
    CHAP. XI -- 21. To us, therefore, words are necessary, that by them we may be assisted in considering and observing what we ask, not as means by which we expect that God is to be either informed or moved to compliance. When, therefore, we say: "Hallowed be Thy name," we admonish ourselves to desire that His name, which is always holy, may be also among men esteemed holy, that is to say, not despised ;. which is an advantage not to God, but to men. When we say: "Thy kingdom come," which shall certainly come whether we wish it or not, we do by these words stir up our own desires for that kingdom, that it may come to us, and that we may be found worthy to reign in it. When we say: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," we pray for ourselves that He would give us the grace of obedience, that His will may be done by us in the same way as it is done in heavenly places by His angels. When we say: "Give us this day our daily bread," the word "this day" signifies for the present time, in which we ask either for that competency of tem-<br>
<br>
466<br>
<br>
poral blessings which I have spoken of before (" bread" being used to designate the whole of those blessings, because of its constituting so important a part of them), or the sacrament of believers, which is in this present time necessary, but necessary in order to obtain the felicity not of the present time, but of eternity. When we say: "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our! debtors," we remind ourselves both what we should ask, and what we should do in order that we may be worthy to receive what we ask. When we say: "Lead us not into temptation," we admonish ourselves to seek that we may not, through being deprived of God's help, be either ensnared to consent or compelled to yield to temptation. When we say: "Deliver us from evil," we admonish ourselves to consider that we are not yet enjoying that good estate in which we shall experience no evil. And this petition, which stands last in the Lord's Prayer, is so comprehensive that a Christian, in whatsoever affliction he be placed, may in using it give utterance to his groans and find vent for his tears -- may begin with this petition, go on with it, and with it conclude his prayer. For it was necessary that by the use of these words the things which they signify should be kept before our memory.<br>
    CHAP. XI. -- 22. For whatever other words we may say,- whether the desire of the person praying go before the words, and employ them in order to give definite form to its requests, or come after them, and concentrate attention upon them, that it may increase in fervour, -- if we pray rightly, and as becomes our wants, we say nothing but what is already contained in the Lord's Prayer. And whoever says in prayer anything which cannot find its place in that gospel prayer, is praying in a way which, if it be not unlawful, is at least not spiritual; and I know not how carnal prayers can be lawful, since it becomes those who are born again by the Spirit to pray in no i other way than spiritually. For example, when one prays: "Be Thou glorified among all nations as Thou art glorified among us," and "Let Thy prophets be found faithful,"' what else does he ask than, "Hallowed be Thy name "? When one says: "Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved," ' what else is he saying than, "Let Thy kingdom come "? When one says: "Order my steps in Thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me," 3 what else is he saying than, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven "? When one says: "Give me ne, neither poverty nor riches," 4 what else is this than, Give us this day our daily bread "? When one says: "Lord, remember David, and all his compassion," s or, "O Lord, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands, if I have rewarded evil to them that did evil to me," 6 what else is this than, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors "? When one says: "Take away from me the lusts of the appetite, and let not sensual desire take hold on me," 7 what else is this than, "Lead us not into temptation"? When one says: "Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God; defend me from them that rise up against me," s what else is this than, "Deliver us from evil "? And if you go over all the words of holy prayers, you will, I believe, find nothing which cannot be comprised and summed up in the petitions of the Lord's Prayer. Wherefore, in praying, we are free to use different words to any extent, but we must ask the same things; in this we have no choice.<br>
    23. These things it is our duty to ask without hesitation for ourselves and for our friends, and for strangers -- yea, even for enemies; although in the heart of the person praying, desire for one and for another may arise, differing in nature or in strength according to the more immediate or more remote relationship. But he who says in prayer such words as, "0 Lord, multiply my riches;" or, "Give me as much wealth as Thou hast given to this or that man;" or, "Increase my honours, make me eminent for power and fame in this world," or something else of this sort, and who asks merely from a desire for these things, and not in order through them to benefit men agreeably to God's will, I do not think that he will find any part of the Lord's Prayer in connection with which he could fit in these requests. Wherefore let us be ashamed at least to ask these things, if we be not ashamed to desire them. If, however, we are ashamed of even desiring them, but feel ourselves overcome by the desire, how much better would it be to ask to be freed from this plague of desire by Him to whom we say, "Deliver us from evil" !<br>
    CHAP. XIII. -- 24. You have now, if I am not mistaken, an answer to two questions, -- what kind of person you ought to be if you would pray, and what things you should ask in prayer; and the answer has been given not by my teaching, but by His who has condescended to teach us all. A happy life is to be sought after, and this is to be asked from the Lord God. Many different answers have been given by many in discussing wherein true happiness consists; but why should we go to many teachers, or consider many answers to this question? It has been briefly and truly stated in the divine Scriptures,<br>
<br>
467<br>
<br>
"Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord." ' That we may be numbered among this people, and that we may attain to beholding Him and dwelling for ever with Him, "the end of the commandment is, charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."2 In the same three, hope has been placed instead of a good conscience. Faith, hope, and charity, therefore, lead unto God the man who prays, i.e. who believes, hopes, and desires, and is guided as to what he should ask from the Lord by studying the Lord's Prayer. Fasting, and abstinence from gratifying carnal desire in other pleasures without injury to health, and especially frequent almsgiving, are a great assistance in prayer; so that we may be able to say, "In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord, with my hands in the night before Him, and I was not deceived." s For how can God, who is a Spirit, and who cannot be touched, be sought with hands in any other sense than by good works ?<br>
    CHAP. XIV. -- 25. Perhaps you may still ask why the apostle said, "We know not what to pray for as we ought," 4 for it is wholly incredible that either he or those to whom he wrote were ignorant of the Lord's Prayer. He could not say this either rashly or falsely; what, then, do we suppose to be his reason for the statement ? Is it not that vexations and troubles in this world are for the most part profitable either to heal the swelling of pride, or to prove and exercise patience, for which, after such probation and discipline, a greater reward is reserved, or to punish and eradicate some sins; but we, not knowing what beneficial purpose these may serve, desire to be freed from all tribulation ? To this ignorance the apostle showed that even he himself was not a stranger (unless, perhaps, he did it notwithstanding his knowing what to pray for as he ought), when, lest he should be exalted above measure by the greatness of the revelations, there was given unto him a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet him; for which thing, not knowing surely what he ought to pray for, he besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from him. At length he received! the answer of God, declaring why that which so great a man prayed for was denied, and why it was expedient that it should not be done: "My grace is sufficient for thee; my strength is made perfect in weakness."5<br>
    26. Accordingly, we know not what to pray for as we ought in regard to tribulations, which may do us good or harm; and yet, because they are hard and painful, and against the natural feelings of our weak nature, we pray, with a desire which is common to mankind, that they may be removed from us. But we ought to exercise such submission to the will of the Lord our God, that if He does not remove those vexations, we do not suppose ourselves to be neglected by Him, but rather, in patient endurance of evil, hope to be made partakers of greater good, for so His strength is perfected in our weakness. God has sometimes in anger granted the request of impatient petitioners, as in mercy He denied it to the apostle. For we read what the Israelites asked, and in what manner they asked and obtained their request; but while their desire was granted, their impatience was severely corrected? Again, He gave them, in answer to their request, a king according to their heart, as it is written, not according to His own heart? He granted also what the devil asked, namely, that His servant, who was to be proved, might be tempted.s He granted also the request of unclean spirits, when they besought Him that their legion might be sent into the great herd of swine.9 These things are written to prevent any one from thinking too highly of himself if he has received an answer when he was urgently asking anything which it would be more advantageous for him not to receive, or to prevent him from being cast down and despairing of the divine compassion towards himself if he be not heard, when, perchance, he is asking something by the obtaining of which he might be more grievously afflicted, or might be by the corrupting influences of prosperity wholly destroyed. In regard to such things, therefore, we know not what to pray for as we ought. Accordingly, if anything is ordered in a way contrary to our prayer, we ought, patiently bearing the disappointment, and in everything giving thanks to God, to entertain no doubt whatever that it was right that the will of God and not our will should be done. For of this the Mediator has given us an example, inasmuch as, after He had said, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me," transforming the human will which was in Him through His incarnation, He immediately added, "Nevertheless, O Father, not as I will but as Thou wilt."'� Wherefore, not without reason are many made righteous by the obedience of One."<br>
    27. But whoever desires from the Lord that "one thing," and seeks after it, 12 asks in certainty and in confidence, and has no fear lest when obtained it be injurious to him, seeing that, without it, anything else which he may have obtained<br>
<br>
468<br>
<br>
by asking in a right way is of no advantage to him. The thing referred to is the one true and only happy life, in which, immortal and incorincorruptible in body and spirit, we may contemplate the joy of the Lord for ever. All other things are desired, and are without impropriety prayed for, with a view to this one thing. For whosoever has it shall have all that he wishes, and cannot possibly wish to have anything along with it which would be unbecoming. For in it is the fountain of life, which we must now thirst for in prayer so long as we live in hope, not yet seeing that which we hope for, trusting under the shadow of His wings before whom are all our desires, that we may be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of His house, and made to drink of the river of His pleasures; because1 with Him is the fountain of life, and in His light we shall see light,, when our desire shall be satisfied with good things, and when there shall be nothing beyond to be sought after with groaning, but all things shall be possessed by us with rejoicing. At the same time, because this blessing is nothing else than the "peace which passeth all understanding,"2 even when we are asking it in our prayers, we know not what to pray for as we ought. For inasmuch as we cannot present it to our minds as it really is, we do not know it, but whatever image of it may be presented to our minds we reject, disown, and condemn; we know it is not what we are seeking, although we do not yet know enough to be able to define what we seek.<br>
    CHAP. XV.--28. There is therefore in us a certain learned ignorance, so to speak--an ignorance which we learn from that Spirit of God who helps our infirmities. For after the apostle said, "If we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it," he added in the same passage, "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. And He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the Spirit, because He maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God." a This is not to be understood as if it meant that the Holy Spirit of God, who is in the Trinity, God unchangeable, and is one God with the Father and the Son, intercedes for the saints like one who is not a divine person; for it is said, "He maketh intercession for the saints," because He enables the saints to make intercession, as in another place it is said, "The Lord your God proverb you, that He may know whether ye love Him," 4 i.e. that He may make you know. He therefore makes the saints intercede with groanings which cannot be uttered, when He inspires them with longings for that great blessing, as yet unknown, for which we patiently wait. For how is that which is desired set forth in language if it be unknown, for if it were utterly unknown it would' not be desired; and on the other hand, if it were seen, it would not be desired nor sought for with groanings ?<br>
             CHAP. XVI. -- 29. Considering all these things,<br>
and whatever else the Lord shall have made known to you in this matter, which either does not occur to me or would take too much time to state here, strive in prayer to overcome this world: pray in hope, pray in faith, pray in love, pray earnestly and patiently, pray as a widow belonging to Christ. For although prayer is, as He has taught, the duty of all His members, i.e. of all who believe in Him and are united to His body, a more assiduous attention to prayer is found to be specially enjoined in Scripture upon those who are widows. Two women of the name of Anna are honourably named there, -- the one, Elkanah's wife, who was the mother of holy Samuel; the other, the widow who recognised the Most Holy One when He was yet a babe. The former, though married, prayed with sorrow of mind and brokenness of heart because she had no sons; and she obtained Samuel, and dedicated him to the Lord, because she vowed to do so when she prayed for him.s It is not easy, however, to find to what petition of the Lord's Prayer her petition could be referred, unless it be to the last, "Deliver us from evil," because it was esteemed to be an evil to be married and not to have offspring as the fruit of marriage. Observe, however, what is written concerning the other Anna, the widow: she "departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day." 6 In 'like manner, the apostle said in words already quoted, "She that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day ;" 7 and the Lord, when exhorting men to pray always and not to faint, made mention of a widow, who, by persevering importunity, persuaded a judge to attend to her cause, though he was an unjust and wicked man, and one who neither feared God nor regarded man. How incumbent it is on widows to go beyond others in devoting time to prayer may be plainly enough seen from the fact that from among them are taken the examples set forth as an exhortation to all to earnestness in prayer.<br>
    30. Now what makes this work specially suitable to widows but their bereaved and desolate<br>
469<br>
<br>
condition? Whosoever, then, understands that he is in this world bereaved and desolate as long as he is a pilgrim absent from his Lord, is careful to commit his widowhood, so to speak, to his God as his shield in continual and most fervent prayer. Pray, therefore, as a widow of Christ, not yet seeing Him whose help you implore. And though you are very wealthy, pray as a poor person, for you have not yet the true riches of the world to come, in which you have no loss to fear. Though you have sons and grandchildren, and a large household, still pray, as I said already, as one who is desolate, for we have no certainty in regard to all temporal blessings that they shall abide for our consolation even to the end of this present life. If you seek and relish the things that are above, you desire things everlasting and sure; and as long as you do not yet possess them, you ought to regard yourself as desolate, even though all your family are spared to you, and live as you desire. And if you thus act, assuredly your example will be followed by your most devout daughter-in-law,1 and the other holy widows and virgins that are settled in peace under your care; for the more pious the manner in which you order your house, the more are you bound to persevere fervently in prayer, not engaging yourselves with the affairs of this world further than is demanded in the interests of religion.<br>
    31. By all means remember to pray earnestly for me. I would not have you yield such deference to the office fraught with perils which I bear, as to refrain from giving the assistance which I know myself to need. Prayer was made by the household of Christ for Peter and for Paul. I rejoice that you are in His household; and I need, incomparably more than Peter and Paul did, the help of the prayers of the brethren. Emulate each other in prayer with a holy rivalry, with one heart, for you wrestle not against each other, but against the devil, who is the common enemy of all the saints. "By fasting, by vigils, and all mortification of the body, prayer is greatly helped." 2 Let each one do what she can; what one cannot herself do, she does by another who can do it, if she loves in another that which personal inability alone hinders her from doing; wherefore let her who can do less not keep back the one who can do more, and let her who can do more not urge unduly her who can do less. For your conscience is responsible to God; to each other owe nothing but mutual love. May the Lord, who is able to do above what we ask or think, give ear to your prayers.3<br>

<br>
	TO HIS MOST EXCELLENT DAUGHTER, THE NOBLE AND DESERVEDLY ILLUSTRIOUS LADY PROBA, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    You speak the truth when you say that the soul, having its abode in a corruptible body, is restrained by this measure of contact with the earth, and is somehow so bent and crushed by this burden that its desires and thoughts go more easily downwards to many things than upwards to one. For Holy Scripture says the same: "The corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things." 4 But our Saviour, who by His healing word raised up the woman in the gospel that had been eighteen years bowed down 5 (whose case was, perchance, a figure of spiritual infirmity), came for this purpose, that Christians might not hear in vain the call, "Lift up your hearts," and might truly reply, "We lift them up to the Lord." Looking to this, you do well to regard the evils of this world as easy to bear because of the hope of the world to come. For thus, by being rightly used, these evils become a blessing, because, while they do not increase our desires for this world, they exercise our patience; as to which the apostle says, "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God: "6 all things, he saith -- not only, therefore, those which are desired because pleasant, but also those which are shunned because painful; since we receive the former without being carried away by them, and bear the latter without being crushed by them, and in all give thanks, according to the divine command, to Him of whom we say, "I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth," 7 and, "It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me, that I might learn Thy statutes." 8 The truth is, most noble lady, that if the calm of this treacherous prosperity were always smiling upon us, the soul of man would never make for the haven of true and certain safety. Wherefore, in returning the respectful salutation due to your Excellency, and expressing my gratitude for your most pious care for my welfare, I ask of the Lord that He may grant to you the rewards of the life to come, and consolation in the present life; and I commend myself to the love and prayers of all of you in whose hearts Christ dwells by faith.<br>
    (In another hand.) May the true and faithful God truly comfort your heart and preserve<br>

	TO VOLUSIANUS, MY NOBLE LORD AND MOST JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED SON, BISHOP AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    In my desire for your welfare, both in this world and in Christ, I am perhaps not even surpassed by the prayers of your pious mother. Wherefore, in reciprocating your salutation with the respect due to your worth, I beg to exhort you, as earnestly as I can, not to grudge to devote attention to the study of the Writings which are truly and unquestionably holy. For they are genuine and solid truth, not winning their way to the mind by artificial eloquence, nor giving forth with flattering voice a vain and uncertain sound. They deeply interest the man who is hungering not for words but for things; and they cause great alarm at first in him whom they are to render safe from fear. I exhort you especially to read the writings of the apostles, for from them you will receive a stimulus to acquaint yourself with the prophets, whose testimonies the apostles use. If in your reading or meditation on what you have read any question arises to the solution of which I may appear necessary, write to me, that I may write in reply. For, with the Lord helping me, I may perhaps be more able to serve you in this way than by personally conversing with you on such subjects, partly because, through the difference in our occupations, it does not happen that you have leisure at the same times as I might have it, but especially because of the irrepressible intrusion of those who are for the most part not adapted to such discussions, and take more pleasure in a war of words than in the clear light of knowledge; whereas, whatever is written stands always at the service of the reader when he has leisure, and there can be nothing burdensome in the society of that which is taken up or laid aside at your own pleasure.<br>

                               (A.D. 412.)<br>
	TO MARCELLINUS,1 MY NOBLE LORD, JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED, MY SON VERY MUCH BELOVED AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. I have learned that the Circumcelliones and clergy of the Donatist faction belonging to the district of Hippo, whom the guardians of public order had brought to trial for their deeds, have been examined by your Excellency, and that the most of them have confessed their share in the violent death which the presbyter Restitutus suffered at their hands, and in the beating of Innocentius, another Catholic presbyter, as well as in digging out the eye and cutting off the finger of the said Innocentius. This news has plunged me into the deepest anxiety, lest perchance your Excellency should judge them worthy, according to the laws, of punishment not less severe than suffering in their own persons the same injuries as they have inflicted on others. Wherefore I write this letter to implore you by your faith in Christ, and by the mercy of Christ the Lord Himself, by no means to do this or permit it to be done. For although we might silently pass over the execution of criminals who may be regarded as brought up for trial not upon an accusation of ours, but by an indictment presented by those to whose vigilance the preservation of the public peace is entrusted, we do not wish to have the sufferings of the servants of God avenged by the infliction of precisely similar injuries in the way of retaliation. Not, of course, that we object to the removal from these wicked men of the liberty to perpetrate further crimes; but our desire is rather that justice be satisfied without the taking of their lives or the maiming of their bodies in any part, and that, by such coercive measures as may be in accordance with the laws, they be turned from their insane frenzy to the quietness of men in their sound judgment, or compelled to give up mischievous violence and betake themselves to some useful labour. This is indeed called a penal sentence; but who does not see that when a restraint is put upon the boldness of savage violence, and the remedies fitted to produce repentance are not withdrawn, this discipline should be called a benefit rather than vindictive punishment?<br>
    2. Fulfil, Christian judge, the duty of an affectionate father; let your indignation against their : crimes be tempered by considerations of humanity; be not provoked by the atrocity of their sinful deeds to gratify the passion of revenge, but rather be moved by the wounds which these deeds have inflicted on their own souls to exercise a desire to heal them. Do not lose now that fatherly care which you maintained when prosecuting the examination, in doing which you :extracted the confession of such horrid crimes,<br>
<br>
471<br>
<br>
not by stretching them on the rack, not by furrowing their flesh with iron claws,1 not by scorching them with flames, but by beating them with rods, a mode of correction used by schoolmasters? and by parents themselves in chastising children, and often also by bishops in the sentences awarded by them. Do not, therefore, now punish with extreme severity the crimes which you searched out with lenity. The necessity for harshness is greater in the investigation than in the infliction of punishment; for even the gentlest men use diligence and stringency in searching out a hidden crime, that they may find to whom they may show mercy. Wherefore it is generally necessary to use more rigour in making inquisition, so that when the crime has been brought to light, there may be scope for displaying clemency. For all good works love to be set in the light, not in order to obtain glory from men, but, as the Lord saith, "that they seeing your good works may glorify your Father who is in heaven." 3 And, for the same reason, the apostle was not satisfied with merely exhorting us to practise moderation, but also commands us to make it known: "Let your moderation," he says, "be known unto all men; "4 and in another place, "Showing all meekness unto all men." 5 Hence, also, that most signal forbearance of the holy David, when he mercifully spared his enemy when delivered into his hand,6 would not have been so conspicuous had not his power to act otherwise been manifest. Therefore let not the power of executing vengeance inspire you with harshness, seeing that the necessity of examining the criminals did not make you lay aside your clemency. Do not call for the executioner now when the crime has been found out, after having forborne from calling in the tormentor when you were finding it out.<br>
    3. In fine, you have been sent hither for the benefit of the Church. I solemnly declare that what I recommend is expedient in the interests of the Catholic Church, or, that I may not seem to pass beyond the boundaries of my own charge, I protest that it is for the good of the Church belonging to the diocese of Hippo. If you do not hearken to me asking this favour as a friend, hearken to me offering this counsel as a bishop; although, indeed, it would not be presumption for me to say -- since I am addressing a Christian, and especially in such a case as this -- that it becomes you to hearkem to me as a bishop commanding with authority, my noble and justly distinguished lord and much -- loved son. I am aware that the principal charge of law cases connected with the affairs of the Church has been devolved on your Excellency, but as I believe that this particular case belongs to the very illustrious and honourable proconsul, I have written a letter 7 to him also, which I beg you not to refuse to give to him, or, if necessary, recommend to his attention; and I entreat you both not to resent our intercession, or counsel, or anxiety, as officious. And let not the sufferings of Catholic servants of God, which ought to be useful in the spiritual upbuilding of the weak, be sullied by the retaliation of injuries on those who did them wrong, but rather, tempering the rigour of justice, let it be your care as sons of the Church to commend both your own faith and your Mother's clemency.<br>
    May almighty God enrich your Excellency with all good things, my noble and justly distinguished lord and dearly beloved son !<br>

<br>
	TO BISHOP AUGUSTIN, MY LORD TRULY HOLY, AND FATHER JUSTLY REVERED, VOLUSIANUS SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    I. O man who art a pattern of goodness and uprightness, you ask me to apply to you for instruction in regard to some of the obscure passages which occur in my reading. I accept at your command the favour of this kindness, and willingly offer myself to be taught by you, acknowledging the authority of the ancient proverb, "We are never too old to learn." With good reason the author of this proverb has not restricted by any limits or end our pursuit of wisdom; for truth,8 secluded in its original principles, is never so disclosed to those who approach it as to be wholly revealed to their knowledge. It seems to me, therefore, my lord truly holy, and father justly revered, worth while to communicate to you the substance of a conversation which recently took place among us. I was present at a gathering of friends, and a great many opinions were brought forward there, such as the disposition and studies of each suggested. Our discourse was chiefly, however, on the department of rhetoric which treats of proper arrangement.9 I speak to one familiar with the subject, for you were not long ago a teacher of these things. Upon this followed a discussion<br>
<br>
472<br>
<br>
regarding "invention" in rhetoric, its nature, what boldness it requires, how great the labour, involved in methodical arrangement, what is the charm of metaphors, and the beauty of illustrations, and the power of applying epithets suitable to the character and nature of the subject in hand. Others extolled with partiality the poet's art. This part also of eloquence is not left unnoticed or unhonoured by you. We may appropriately apply to you that line of the poet: "The ivy is intertwined with the laurels which reward your victory."1 We spoke, accordingly, of the embellishments which skilful arrangement adds to a poem, of the beauty of metaphors, and of the sublimity of well-chosen comparisons; then we spoke of smooth and flowing versification, and, if I may use the expression, the harmonious variation of the pauses in the lines? The conversation turned next to a subject with which you are very familiar, namely, that philosophy which you were wont yourself to cherish after the manner of Aristotle and Isocrates. We asked what had been achieved by the philosopher of the Lyceum, by the varied and incessant doubtings of the Academy, by the debater of the Porch, by the discoveries of natural philosophers, by the self-indulgence of the Epicureans; and what had been the result of their boundless zeal in disputation with each other, and how truth was more than ever unknown by them after they assumed that its knowledge was attainable.<br>
    2. While our conversation continues on these. topics, one of the large company says: "Who among us is so thoroughly acquainted with the wisdom taught by Christianity as to be able to resolve the doubts by which I am entangled, and to give firmness to my hesitating acceptance of its teaching by arguments in which truth or probability may claim my belief ?" We are all dumb with amazement. Then, of his own accord, he breaks forth in these words: "I wonder whether the Lord and Ruler of the world did indeed fill the womb of a virgin ; -- did His mother endure the protracted fatigues of ten months, and, being yet a virgin, in due season bring forth her child, and continue even after that with her virginity intact?" To this he adds other statements: "Within the small body of a crying infant He is concealed whom the universe .scarcely can contain; He bears the years of childhood, He grows up, He is established in the rigour of manhood; this Governor is so long an exile from His own dwelling-place, and the care of the whole world is transferred to one body of insignificant dimensions. Moreover, He falls asleep, takes food to support Him, is subject to all the sensations of mortal men. Nor did the proofs of so great majesty shine forth with adequate fulness of evidence; for the casting out of devils, the curing of the sick, and the restoration of the dead to life are, if you consider others who have wrought these wonders, but small works for God to do." We prevent him from continuing such questions, and the meeting having broken up, we referred the matter to the valuable decision of experience beyond our own, lest, by too rashly intruding into hidden things, the error, innocent thus far, should become blameworthy.<br>
    You have heard, O man worthy of all honour, the confession of our ignorance; you perceive what is requested at your hands. Your reputation is interested in our obtaining an answer to these questions. Ignorance may, without harm to religion, be tolerated in other priests; but when we come to Bishop Augustin, whatever we find unknown to him is no part of the Christian system. May the Supreme God protect your venerable Grace, my lord truly holy and justly revered !<br>

<br>
	TO AUGUSTIN, MY LORD MOST VENERABLE, AND FATHER SINGULARLY WORTHY OF ALL POSSIBLE SERVICE FROM ME, I, MARCELLINUS SEND GREETING.<br>
<br>
    1. The noble Volusianus read to me the letter of your Holiness, and, at my urgent solicitation, he read to many more the sentences which had won my admiration, for, like everything else coming from your pen, they were worthy of admiration. Breathing as it did a humble spirit, and rich in the grace of divine eloquence, it succeeded easily in pleasing the reader.. What especially pleased me was your strenuous effort to establish and hold up the steps of one who is somewhat hesitating, by counselling him to form a good resolution. For I have every day some discussion with the same man, so far as my abilities, or rather my lack of talent, may enable me. Moved by the earnest entreaties of his pious another, I am at pains to visit him frequently, and he is so good as to return my visits from time to time. But on receiving this letter from your venerable Eminence, though he is kept back from firm faith in the true God by the influence of a class of persons who abound in this city, he was so moved, that, as he himself tells me, he was prevented only by the fear of undue prolixity in his letter from unfolding to you every possible difficulty in regard to the Christian faith. Some things, however, he has very earnestly asked you to explain, expressing himself in a polished and accurate style, and<br>
<br>
473<br>
<br>
with the perspicuity and brilliancy of Roman eloquence, such as you will yourself deem worthy of approbation. The question which he has submitted to you is indeed worn threadbare in controversy, and the craftiness which, from the same quarter, assails with reproaches the Lord's incarnation is well known. But as I am confident that whatever you write in reply will be of use to a very large number, I would approach you with the request, that even in this question you would condescend to give a thoroughly guarded answer to their false statement that in His works the Lord performed nothing beyond what other men have been able to do. They are accustomed to bring forward their Apollonius and Apuleius, and other men who professed magical arts, whose miracles they maintained to have been greater than the Lord's.<br>
    2. The noble Volusianus aforesaid declared also in the presence of a number, that there were many other things which might not unreasonably be added to the question which he has sent, were it not that, as I have already stated, brevity had been specially studied by him in his letter. Although, however, he forbore from writing them, he did not pass them over in silence. For he is wont to say that, even if a reasonable account of the Lord's incarnation were now given to him, it would still be very difficult to give a satisfactory reason why this God, who is affirmed to be the God also of the Old Testament, is pleased with new sacrifices after having rejected the ancient sacrifices. For he alleges that nothing could be corrected but that which is proved to have been previously not rightly done; or that what has once been done rightly ought not to be altered in the very least. That which has been rightly done, he said, cannot be changed without wrong, especially because the variation might bring upon the Deity the reproach of inconstancy. Another objection which he stated was, that the Christian doctrine and preaching were in no way consistent with the duties and rights of citizens; because, to quote an instance frequently alleged, among its precepts we find, "Recompense to no man evil for evil,"1 and, "Whosoever shall smite thee on one cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have I thy cloak also; and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain;"2 -- all which he affirms to be contrary to the duties and rights of citizens. For who would submit to have anything taken from him by an enemy, or forbear from retaliating the evils of war upon an invader who ravaged a Roman province? The other precepts, as your Eminence understands, are open to similar objections. Volusianus thinks that all these difficulties may be added to the question formerly stated, especially because it is manifest (though he is silent on this point) that very great calamities have befallen the commonwealth under the government of emperors observing, for the most part, the Christian religion.3<br>
    3. Wherefore, as your Grace condescends along with me to acknowledge, it is important that all these difficulties be met by a full, thorough, and luminous reply (since the welcome answer of your Holiness will doubtless be put into many hands); especially because, while this discussion was going on, a distinguished lord and proprietor in the region of Hippo was present, who ironically said some flattering things concerning your Holiness, and affirmed that he had been by no means satisfied when he inquired into these matters himself.<br>
    I, therefore, not unmindful of your promise, but insisting on its fulfilment, beseech you to write, on the questions submitted, treatises which will be of incredible service to the Church, especially at the present time.<br>
<br>
                       LETTER CXXXVII. (A.D. 412.)<br>
	TO MY MOST EXCELLENT SON, THE NOBLE AND JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED LORD VOLUSIANUS, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    CHAP. I. -- I. I have read your letter, containing an abstract of a notable conversation given with praiseworthy conciseness. I feel bound to reply to it, and to forbear from alleging any excuse for delay; for it happens opportunely that I have a short time of leisure from occupation with the affairs of other persons. I have also put off in the meantime dictating to my amanuensis certain things to which I had purposed to devote this leisure, for I think it would be a grievous injustice to delay answering questions which I had myself exhorted the questioner to pro. pound. For which of us who are administering, as we are able, the grace of Christ would wish to see you instructed in Christian doctrine only so far as might suffice to secure to yourself salvation not salvation in this present life, which, as the word of God is careful to remind us, is but a vapor appearing for a little while and then vanishing away, but that salvation in order to the obtaining and eternal possession of which we are Christians ? It seems to us too l little that you should receive only so much instructions suffices to your own. deliverance. For your gifted mind, and your singularly able land lucid power of speaking, ought to be of<br>
<br>
474<br>
<br>
service to all others around you, against whom, whether slowness or perversity be the cause, it is necessary to defend in a competent way the dispensation of such abounding grace, which small minds in their arrogance despise, boasting that they can do very great things, while in fact they can do nothing to cure or even to curb their own vices.<br>
    2. You ask: "Whether the Lord and Ruler of the world did indeed fill the womb of a virgin? did His mother endure the protracted fatigues of ten months, and, being yet a virgin, in due season bring forth her child, and continue even after that with her virginity intact? Was He whom the universe is supposed to be scarcely able to contain concealed within the small body of a crying infant ? did He bear the years of childhood, and grow up and become established in the rigour of manhood ? Was this Governor so long an exile from His own  dwelling-place, and was the care of the whole world transferred to a body of such insignificant dimensions? Did He sleep, did He take food as nourishment, and was He subject to all the sensations of mortal men ?" You go on to say that "the proofs of His great majesty do not shine forth with any adequate fulness of evidence; for the casting out of devils, the curing of the sick, and the restoration of the dead are, if we consider others who have performed these wonders, but small works for God to do." 1 This question, you say, was introduced in a certain meeting of friends by one of the company,, but that the rest of you prevented him from bringing forward any further questions, and, breaking up the meeting, deferred the consideration of the matter till you should have the benefit of experience beyond your own, lest, by too rashly intruding into hidden things, the error, innocent thus far, should become blame-worthy.<br>
    3. Thereupon you appeal to me, and request me to observe what is desired from me after this confession of your ignorance. You add, that my reputation is concerned in your obtaining an answer to these questions, because, though ignorance is tolerated without injury to religion in other priests, when an inquiry is addressed to me, who am a bishop, whatever is not known to me must be no part of the Christian system.<br>
    I begin, therefore, by requesting you to lay aside the opinion which you have too easily. formed concerning me, and dismiss those sentiments, though they are gratifying evidences of your goodwill, and believe my testimony rather than any other's regarding myself, if you reciprocate my affection. For such is the depth of the Christian Scriptures, that even if I were attempting to study them and nothing else from early boyhood to decrepit old age, with the utmost leisure, the most unwearied zeal, and talents greater than I have, I would be still daily making progress in discovering their treasures; not that there is so great difficulty in coming through them to know the things necessary to salvation, but when any one has accepted these truths with the faith that is indispensable as the foundation of a life of piety and uprightness, so many things which are veiled under manifold shadows of mystery remain to be inquired into by those who are advancing in the study, and so great is the depth of wisdom not only in the words in which these have been expressed, but also in the things themselves, that the experience of the oldest, the ablest, and the most zealous students of Scripture illustrates what Scripture itself has said: "When a man hath done, then he beginneth."2<br>
    CHAP. II. -- 4. But why say more as to this? must rather address myself to the question which you propose. In the first place, I wish you to understand that the Christian doctrine does not hold that the Godhead was so blended with the human nature in which He was born of the virgin that He either relinquished or lost the administration of the universe, or transferred it to that body as a small and limited material substance. Such an opinion is held only by men who are incapable of conceiving of anything but material substances -- whether more dense, like water and earth, or more subtle, like air and light; but all alike distinguished by this condition, that none of them can be in its entirety everywhere, because, by reason of its many parts, it cannot but have one part here, another there, and however great or small the body may be, it must occupy some place, and so fill it that in its entirety it is in no one part of the space occupied. And hence it is the distinctive property of material bodies that they can be condensed and rarefied, contracted and dilated, crushed into small fragments and enlarged to great masses. The nature of the soul is very far different from that of the body; and how much more different must be the nature of God, who is the Creator of both soul and body ! God is not said to fill the world in the same way as water, air, and even light occupy space, so that with a greater or smaller part of Himself He occupies a greater or smaller part of the world. He is able to be everywhere present in the entirety of His being: He cannot be confined in any place: He can come without leaving the place where He was: He can depart without forsaking the place to which He had<br>
come.<br>
<br>
475<br>
<br>
    5. The mind of man wonders at this, and because it cannot comprehend it, refuses, perhaps, to believe it. I,et it, however, not go on to wonder incredulously at the attributes of the Deity without first wondering in like manner at the mysteries within itself;1 let it, if possible, raise itself for a little above the body, and above those things which it is accustomed to perceive by the bodily organs, and let it contemplate what that is which uses the body as its instrument. Perhaps it cannot do this, for it requires, as one has said, great power of mind to call the mind aside from the senses, and to lead thought away from its wonted track? Let the mind, then, examine the bodily senses in this somewhat unusual manner, and with the utmost attention. There are five distinct bodily senses, which cannot exist either without the body or without the soul; because perception by the senses is possible, on the one hand, only while a man lives, and the body receives life from the soul; and on the other hand, only by the instrumentality of the body vessels and organs, through which we exercise sight, hearing, and the three other senses. Let the reasoning m soul concentrate attention upon this subject, and: consider the senses of the body not by these senses themselves, but by its own intelligence and, reason. A man cannot, of course, perceive by these senses unless he lives; but up to the time when soul and body are separated by death, he lives in the body. How, then, does his soul,  which lives nowhere else than in his body, perceive things which are beyond the surface of that body ? Are not the stars in heaven very remote from his body? and yet does he not see the sun yonder? and is not seeing an exercise of the bodily senses -- may, is it not the noblest of them all ? What, then? Does he live in heaven as well as in his body, because he perceives by one of his senses what is in heaven, and perception by sense cannot be in a place where there is no life of the person perceiving? Or does he perceive even where he is not living -- because while he lives only in his own body, his perceptive sense is active also in those places which, outside of his body and remote from it, contain the objects with which he is in contact by sight ? Do you see how great a mystery there is even in a sense so open to our observation as that which we call sight ? Consider hearing also, and say whether the soul diffuses itself in some way abroad beyond the body. For how do we say, "Some one knocks at the door," unless we exercise the sense of hearing at the place where the knock is sounding ? In this case also, therefore, we live beyond the limits of our bodies. Or can we perceive by sense in a place in which we are not living ? But we know that sense cannot be in exercise where life is not.<br>
 6. The other three senses are exercised through immediate contact with their own organs. Perhaps this may be reasonably disputed in regard to the sense of smell; but there is no controversy ins to the senses of taste and touch, that we perceive nowhere else than by contact with our bodily organism the things which we taste and touch. Let these three senses, therefore, be set aside from present consideration The senses of sight and hearing present to us a wondered question, requiring us to explain either how the soul I can perceive by these senses in a place where it does not live, or how it can live in a place where it is not. For it is not anywhere but in its own body, and yet it perceives by these senses in places beyond that body. For in whatever place the soul sees anything, in that place it is exercising the faculty of perception, because seeing is an act of perception; and in whatever place the soul hears anything, in that place it is exercising the faculty of perception, because hearing is an act of perception. Wherefore the soul is either living in that place where it sees or hears, and consequently is itself in that place, or it exercises perception in a place where it is not living, or it is living in a place and yet at the same moment is not there. All these things are astonishing; not one of them can be stated without seeming absurdity; and we are speaking only of senses which are mortal. What, then, is the soul itself which is beyond the bodily senses, that is to say, which resides in the understanding I whereby it considers these mysteries ? For it is not by means of the senses that it forms a judgment concerning the senses themselves. And do we suppose that something incredible is told us regarding the omnipotence of God, when it is affirmed that the Word of God, by whom all things were made, did so assume a body from the Virgin, and manifest Himself with mortal senses, as neither to destroy His own immortality, nor to change His eternity, nor to diminish His power, nor to relinquish the government of the world, nor to withdraw from the bosom of the Father, that is, from the secret place where He is with Him and in Him ?<br>
    7. Understand the nature of the Word of God, by whom all things were made, to be such that you cannot think of any part of the Word as passing, and, from being future, becoming past. He remains as He is, and He is everywhere in His entirety. He comes when He is manifested, and departs when He is concealed. But whether concealed or manifested, He is present with us as light is present to the eyes both of the seeing and of the blind; but it is felt to be present by the man who sees, and absent by him who is blind. In like manner, the sound of the voice<br>
<br>
476<br>
<br>
is near alike to the hearing and to the deaf, but it makes its presence known to the former and is hidden from the latter. But what is more wonderful than what happens in connection with the sound of our voices and our words, a thing, for-sooth, which passes away in a month? For when we speak, there is no place for even the next syllable till after the preceding one has ceased to sound; nevertheless, if one hearer be present, he hears the whole of what we say, and if two hearers be present, both hear the same, and to each of them it is the whole; and if a multitude listen in silence, they do not break up the sounds like loaves of bread, to be distributed among them individually, but all that is uttered is imparted to all and to each in its entirety. Consider this, and say if it is not more incredible that the abiding word of God should not accomplish in the universe what the passing word of man accomplishes in the ears of listeners, namely, that as the word of man is present in its entirety to each and all of the hearers, so tile Word of God should be present in the entirety of His being at the same moment everywhere.<br>
    8. There is, therefore, no reason to fear in regard to the small body of the Lord in His infancy, lest in it the Godhead should seem to have been straitened. For it is not in vast size but in power that God is great: He has in His providence given to ants and to bees senses superior to those given to asses and camels; He forms the huge proportions of the fig-tree from one of the minutest seeds, although many smaller plants spring from much larger seeds; He also has furnished the small pupil of the eye with the power which. by one glance, sweeps over almost the half of heaven in a moment; He diffuses the whole fivefold system of the nerves over tile body from one centre and point in the brain; He dispenses vital motion throughout the whole body from the heart, a member comparatively small; and by these and other similar things, He, who in small things is great, mysteriously produces that which is great from things which are exceedingly little. Such is the greatness of His power that He is conscious of no difficulty in that which is difficult. It was this same power which originated, not from without, but from within, the conception of a child in the Virgin's womb: this same power associated with Himself a human soul, and through it also a human body in short, the whole human nature to be elevated by its union with Him -- without His being thereby lowered in any degree; justly assuming from it the name of humanity, while amply giving to it the name of Godhead. The body of the infant Jesus was brought forth from the womb of His mother, still a virgin, by the same power which afterwards introduced His body when He was a man through the closed door into the upper chamber? Here, if the reason of the event is sought out, it will no longer be a miracle; if an example of a precisely similar event is demanded. it will no longer be unique.3 Let us grant that God can do something which we must admit to be beyond our  comprehension. In such wonders the whole explanation of the work is the power of Him by whom it is wrought.<br>
 Chap. III. -- 9. The fact that He took rest in sleep, and was nourished by food, and experienced all the feelings of humanity, is the evidence to men of the reality of that human nature which He assumed but did not destroy. Behold, this was the fact; and yet some heretics, by a perverted admiration and praise of Hishave refused altogether to  acknowledge the reality of His human nature, in which is he guarantee of all that grace by which He saves those who believe in Him, containing deep treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and imparting faith to the minds which He raises to the eternal contemplation of unchangeable truth. What if the Almighty had created the human nature of Christ not by causing Him to be born of a mother, but by some other way, and had presented Him suddenly to the eyes of mankind ? What if the Lord had not passed through the stages of progress from infancy to manhood, and had taken neither food nor sleep? Would not this have confirmed the erroneous impression above re-<br>
<br>
477<br>
<br>
ferred to, and have made it impossible to believe at all that He had taken to Himself true human nature; and, while leaving what was marvellous, would eliminate the element of mercy from His actions? But now He has so appeared as the Mediator between God and men, that, uniting the two natures in one person, He both exalted what was ordinary by what was extraordinary, and tempered what was extraordinary by what was ordinary in Himself.<br>
    10. But where in all the varied movements of creation is there any work of God which is not wonderful, were it not that through familiarity these wonders have become small in our esteem ? Nay, how many common things are trodden under foot, which, if examined carefully, awaken our astonishment ! Take, for example, the propertries of seeds: who can either comprehend or declare the variety of species, the vitality, vigour, and secret power by which they from within small compass evolve great things ? Now the human body and soul which He took to Himself was created without seed by Him who in the natural world created originally seeds from no pre-existent seeds. In the body which thus became His, he who, without any liability to change in Him;elf, has woven according to His counsel the vicissitudes of all past centuries, became subject o the succession of seasons and the ordinary .rages of the life of man. For His body, as it began to exist at a point of time, became developed with the lapse of time. But the Word of God, who was in the beginning, and to whom, he ages of time owe their existence, did not how to time as bringing round the event of His incarnation apart from His consent, but chose he point of time at which He freely took our nature to Himself. The human nature was brought into union with the divine; God did not withdraw from Himself.1<br>
    11. Some resist upon being furnished with an explanation of the manner in which the Godhead was so united with a human soul and body as to constitute the one person of Christ, when it was necessary that this should be done once in the world's history, with as much boldness as if they were themselves able to furnish an explanation  of the manner in which the soul is so united to: he body as to constitute the one person of man, an event which is occurring every day. For just as the soul is united to the body in one person so as to constitute man, in the same way God united to man in one person so as to constitute Christ. In the former personality there is a combination of soul and body; in the latter here is a combination of the Godhead and man. I let my reader, however, guard against borrowing his idea of the combination from the properties of material bodies, by which two fluids when combined are so mixed that neither preserves its original character; although even among material bodies there are exceptions, such as light, which sustains no change when combined with the atmosphere. In the person of man, therefore, there is a combination of soul and body; in the i person of Christ there is a combination of the I Godhead with man; for when the Word of God was united to a soul having a body, He took into union with Himself both the soul and the body. The former event takes place daily in the beginning of life in individuals of the human race; the latter took place once for the salvation.of men. And yet of the two events, the combination of two immaterial substances ought to be more easily behaved than a combination in which the one is immaterial and the other material. For if the soul is not mistaken in regard to its own nature, it understands itself to be immaterial. Much more certainly does this attribute belong to the Word of God; and consequently the combination of the Word with the human soul is a combination which ought to be much more credible than that of soul and body. The latter is realized by us in ourselves; the former we are commanded to believe to have been realized in Christ. But if both of them were alike foreign to our experience, and we were enjoined to believe that both had taken place, which of the two would we more readily believe to have occurred? Would were not admit that two immaterial substances could be more easily combined than one immaterial and one material; unless, perhaps, it be unsuitable to use the word combination in connection with these things, because of the difference between their nature and that of material substances, both in themselves and as known to us ?<br>
    12. Wherefore the Word of God, who is also the Son of God, co-eternal with the Father, the Power and the Wisdom of God? mightily pervading and harmoniously ordering all things, from the highest limit of the intelligent to the lowest limit of the material creation? revealed and concealed, nowhere confined, nowhere divided, nowhere distended, but without dimensions, everywhere present in His entirety, -- this Word of God, I say, took to Himself, in a manner entirely different from that in which He is present to other creatures, the soul and body of a man, and made, by the union of Himself therewith, the one person Jesus Christ, Mediator between God and men,4 he His Deity equal with the Father, in His flesh, i.e. in His human nature, inferior to the Father, -- unchangeably immortal in respect of the divine nature, in which He is equal with<br>
<br>
478<br>
<br>
the Father, and yet changeable and mortal in respect of the infirmity which was His through participation with our nature.<br>
    In this Christ there came to men, at the time which He knew to be most fitting, and which He had fixed before the world began, the instruction and the help necessary to the obtaining of eternal salvation. Instruction came by Him, because those truths which had been, for men's advantage, spoken before that time on earth not only by the holy prophets, all whose words were true, but also by philosophers and even poets and authors in every department of literature (for beyond question they mixed much truth with what was false), might by the actual presentation of His authority in human nature be confirmed as true for the sake of those who could not perceive and distinguish them in the light of essential Truth, which Truth was, even before He assumed human nature, present to all who were capable of receiving truth. Moreover, by the fact of His incarnation, He taught this above all other things for our benefit, -- that whereas men longing after the Divine Being supposed, from pride rather than piety, that they must approach Him not directly, but through heavenly powers which they regarded as gods, and through various forbidden rites which were holy but profane, -- in which worship devils succeed, through the bond which pride forms between mankind and them in taking the place of holy angels, -- now men might understand that the God whom they were regarding as far removed, and whom they approached not directly but through mediating powers, is actually so very near to the pious longings of men after Him, that He has condescended to take a human soul and body into such union with Himself that this complete man is joined to Him in the same way as the body is joined to the soul in man, excepting that whereas both body and soul have a common progressive development, He does not participate in this growth, because it implies mutability, a property which God cannot assume. Again, in this Christ the held necessary to salvation was brought to men, for without the grace of that faith which is from Him, no one can either subdue vicious desires, or be cleansed by pardon from the guilt of any power of sinful desire which he may not have wholly vanquished. As to the effects produced by His instruction, is there now even an imbecile, however weak, or a silly woman, however low, that does not believe in the immortality of the soul and the reality of a life after death ? Yet these are truths which, when Pherecydes 1 the Assyrian for the first time  maintained them in discussion among the Greeks of old, moved Pythagoras of Samos so deeply by their novelty, as to make him turn from the exercises of the athlete to the studies of the philosopher. But now what Virgil said we all behold: "The balsam of Assyria grows everywhere."2 And as to the help given through the grace of Christ, in Him truly are the words of the same poet fulfilled: "With Thee as our leader, the obliteration of all the traces of our sin which remain shall deliver the earth from perpetual alarm." 3<br>
    Chap. IV. -- 13. "But," they say, "the proofs of so great majesty did not shine forth with adequate fulness of evidence; for the casting out of devils, the healing of the sick, and the restoration of the dead to life are but small works for God to do, if the others who have wrought similar wonders be borne in mind." 4 We ourselves admit that the prophets wrought some miracles like those performed by Christ. For among these miracles what is more wonderful than the raising of the dead? Yet both Elijah and Elisha did this.s As to the miracles of magicians, and the question whether they also raised the dead, let those pronounce an opinion who strive, not as accusers, but as panegyrists, to prove Apuleius guilty of those charges of practising magical arts from which he himself takes abundant pains to defend his reputation. We read that the magicians of Egypt, the most skilled in these arts, were vanquished by Moses, the servant of God, when they were working wonderfully by impious enchantments, and he, by simply calling upon God in prayer, overthrew all their machinations? But this Moses himself and all the other true prophets prophesied concerning the Lord Christ, and gave to Him great glory; they predicted that He would come not as One merely equal or superior to them in the same power of working miracles, but as One who was truly God the Lord of all, and who became man for the benefit of men. He was pleased to do also some miracles, such as they had done, to prevent the incongruity of His not doing in person such things as He had done by them. Nevertheless, He was to do also some things peculiar to Him, self, namely, to be born of a virgin, to rise from the dead, to ascend to heaven. I know not what greater things he can look for who thinks these too little for God to do.<br>
    14. For I think that such signs of divine power are demanded by these objectors as were not suitable for Him to do when wearing the nature of men. The Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and by Him all things were made.8 Now,<br>
479<br>
<br>
when the Word became flesh, was it necessary for Him to create another world, that we might believe Him to be the person by whom the world was made ? But within this world it would have been impossible to make another greater than itself, or equal to it. If, however, He were to make a world inferior to that which now exists, this, too, would be considered too small a work to prove His deity. Wherefore, since it was not necessary that He should make a new world, He made new things in the world. For that a man should be born of a virgin, and raised from the dead to eternal life, and exalted above the heavens, is perchance a work involving a greater exertion of power than the creating of a world. Here, probably, objectors ma, answer that they do not believe that these things took place. What, then, can be done for men who despise smaller evidences as inadequate, and reject greater evidences as incredible ? That life has been restored to the dead is believed, because it has been accomplished by others, and I is too small a work to prove him who performs it to be God: that a true body was created in a virgin, and being raised from death to eternal life, was taken up to heaven, is not believed, because no one else has done this, and it is what God alone could do. On this principle every man is to accept with equanimity whatever he thinks easy for himself not indeed to do, but to conceive, and is to reject as false and fictitious whatever goes beyond that limit. I beseech you, do' not be like these men.<br>
    15. These topics are elsewhere more amply discussed, and in fundamental questions of doctrine every intricate point has been opened up by thorough investigation and debate; but faith gives the understanding access to these things, unbelief closes the door. What man might not be moved to faith in the doctrine of Christ by such a remarkable chain of events from the beginning, and by the manner in which the epochs of the world are linked together, so that our faith in regard to present things is assisted by what happened in the past, and the record o? earlier and ancient things is attested by later and more recent events? One is chosen from among the Chaldeans, a man endowed with most eminent piety and faith, that to him may be given divine promises, appointed to be fulfilled in the last times of the world, after the lapse of so many centuries; and it is foretold that in his seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.' This man, worshipping the one true God, the Creator of the universe, begets in his old age a son, when sterility and advanced years had made his wife give up all expectation of becoming a mother. The descendants of this son become a very numerous tribe, being increased in Egypt, to which place they had been removed from the East, by Divine Providence multiplying as time went on both the promises given and the works wrought on their behalf. From Egypt they come forth a mighty nation, being brought out with terrible signs and wonders; and the wicked nations of the promised land being driven out from before them, they are brought into it and settled there, and exalted to the position of a kingdom. Thereafter, frequently provoking by prevailing sin and idolatrous impieties the true God, who had bestowed on them so many benefits, and experiencing alternately the chastisements of calamity land the consolations of restored prosperity, the history of the nation is brought down to the incarnation and the manifestation of Christ. Predictions that this Christ, being the Word of God, the Son of God, and God Himself, was to become incarnate, to die, to rise again, to ascend<br>
into heaven, to have multitudes of all nations through the power of His name surrendering themselves to Him, and that by Him pardon of sins and eternal salvation would be given to all who believe in Him,- these predictions, I say, have been published by all tim promises given to that nation, by all the prophecies, the institution of the priesthood, the sacrifices, the temple, and, in short, by all their sacred mysteries.<br>
    16. Accordingly Christ comes: in His birth, life, words, deeds, sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension, all which the prophets had foretold is fulfilled? He sends the Holy Spirit; fills with this Spirit the believers when they are assembled in one house, and expecting with prayer and ardent desire this promised gift. Being thus filled with the Holy Spirit, they speak immediately in the tongues of all nations, they boldly confute errors, they preach the truth that is most profitable for mankind, they exhort men to repent of their past blameworthy lives, and promise pardon by the free grace of God. Signs and miracles suitable for confirmation follow their preaching of piety and of the true religion. The cruel enmity of unbelief is stirred up against them; they bear predicted trials, they hope for promised blessings, and teach that which they had been commanded to make known. Few in number at first, they become scattered like seed throughout the world; they convert nations with won drous facility; they grow in number in the midst of enemies; they become increased by persecutions; and, under the severity of hardships, instead of being straitened, they extend their influence to the utmost boundaries of the earth. From being very ignorant, despised, and few, They become enlightened, distinguished, and nu-<br>
<br>
480<br>
<br>
merous, men of illustrious talents and of polished eloquence; they also bring under the yoke of Christ, and attract to the work of preaching the way of holiness and salvation, the marvellous attainments of men remarkable for genius, eloquence, and erudition. Amid alternations of adversity and prosperity, they watchfully practise patience and self-control; and when the world's day is drawing near its close, and the approaching consummation is heralded by the calamities which exhaust its energies, they, seeing in this the fulfilment of prophecy, only expect with increased. confidence the everlasting blessedness of the heavenly city. Moreover, amidst all these changes, the unbelief of the heathen nations continues to rage against the Church of Christ; she gains the victory by patient endurance, and by the maintenance of unshaken faith in the face of the cruelties of her adversaries.<br>
The sacrifice of Him in whom the truth, long veiled under mystic promises, is revealed, having been offered, those sacrifices by which it was prefigured are finally abolished by the utter destruction of the Jewish temple. The Jewish nation, itself rejected because of unbelief, being now rooted out from its own land, is dispersed to every region of the world, in order that it may carry everywhere the Holy Scriptures, and that in this way our adversaries themselves may bring before mankind the testimony furnished by the prophecies concerning Christ and His Church, thus precluding the possibility of the supposition that these predictions were forged by us to suit the time; in which prophecies, also, the unbelief of these very Jews is foretold. The temples, images, and impious worship of the heathen divinities are overthrown gradually and in succession, according to the prophetic intimations. Heresies bud forth against the name of Christ, though veiling themselves under His name, as had been foretold, by which the doctrine of the holy religion is tested and developed. All these things are now seen to be accomplished, in exact fulfilment of the predictions which we read in Scripture; and from these important and numerous instances of fulfilled prophecy, the fulfilment of the predictions which remain is confidently expected. Where, then, is the mind, having aspirations after eternity, and moved by the shortness of this present life, which can resist the clearness and perfection of these evidences of the divine origin of our faith ?<br>
 Chap. V. -- 17. What discourses or writings of philosophers, what laws of any commonwealth in any land or age, are worthy for a moment to be compared with the two commandments on which Christ saith that all the law and the prophets hang: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"?' All philosophy is here, -- physics, ethics, logic: the first, because in God the Creator are all the causes of all existences in nature; the second, because a good and honest life is not produced in any other way than by loving, in the manner in which they should be loved, the proper objects of our love, namely, God and our neighbour; and the third, because God alone is the Truth and the Light of the rational soul. Here also is security for the welfare and renown of a commonwealth; for no state is perfectly established and preserved otherwise than on the foundation and by the bond of faith and of firm concord, when the highest and truest common good, namely, God, is loved by all, and men love each other in Him without dissimulation, because they love one another for His sake from whom they cannot disguise the real character of their love.<br>
    18. Consider, moreover, the style in which Sacred Scripture is composed, -- how accessible it is to all men, though its deeper mysteries are penetrable to very few. The plain truths which it contains it declares in the artless language of familiar friendship to the hearts both of the unlearned and of the learned; but even the truths which it veils in symbols it does not set forth in stiff and stately sentences, which a mind somewhat sluggish and uneducated might shrink from approaching, as a poor man shrinks from the presence of the rich; but, by the condescension of its style, it invites all not only to be fed with the truth which is plain, but also to be exercised by the truth which is concealed, having both m its simple and in its obscure portions the same truth. Lest what is easily understood should beget satiety in the reader, the same truth being in another place more obscurely expressed becomes again desired, and, being desired, is somehow invested with a new attractiveness, and thus is received with pleasure into the heart. By these means wayward minds are corrected, weak minds are nourished, and strong minds are filled with pleasure, in such a way as is profitable to all. This doctrine has no enemy but the man who, being in error, is ignorant of its incomparable usefulness, or, being spiritually diseased, is averse to its healing power.<br>
    19. You see what a long letter I have written. If, therefore, anything perplexes you, and you regard it of sufficient importance to be discussed between us, let not yourself be straitened by keeping within the bounds of ordinary letters; for you know as well as any one what long letters the ancients wrote when they were treating of any subject which they were not able briefly to explain. And even if the custom of authors in . other department. s of literature had been differ-<br>
<br>
481<br>
<br>
ent, the authority of Christian writers, whose example has a worthier claim upon our imitation, might be set before us. Observe, therefore, the length of the apostolic epistles, and of the commentaries written on these divine oracles, and do not hesitate either to ask many questions if you have many difficulties, or to handle more fully the questions which you propound, in order that, in so far as it can be achieved with such abilities as we possess, there may remain no cloud of doubt to obscure the light of truth.<br>
    20. For I am aware that your Excellency has to encounter the most determined opposition from certain persons, who think, or would have others think, that Christian doctrine is incompatible with the welfare of the commonwealth, because they wish to see the commonwealth established not by the stedfast practice of virtue, but by granting impunity to vice. But with God the crimes in which many are banded together do not pass unavenged, as is often the case with a king, or any other magistrate who is only a man. Moreover, His mercy and grace, published to men by Christ, who is Himself man, and imparted to man by the same Christ, who is also God and the Son of God, never fail those who live by faith in Him and piously worship Him, in adversity patiently and bravely bearing the trials of this life, in prosperity using with self-control and with compassion for others the good things of this life; destined to receive, for faithfulness in both conditions, an eternal recompense in that divine and heavenly city in which there shall be no longer calamity to be painfully endured, nor inordinate desire to be with laborious care controlled, where our only work shall be to preserve, without any difficulty and with perfect liberty, our love to God and to our neighbour.<br>
    May the infinitely compassionate omnipotence of God preserve you in safety and increase your happiness, my noble and distinguished Lord, and my most excellent son. With profound respect, as is due to your worth, I salute your pious and most truly venerable mother, whose prayers on your behalf may God hear ! My pious brother and fellow bishop, Possidius, warmly salutes your Grace.<br>
<br>
                           LETTER CXXXVIII.<br>
                              (A.D. 412.)<br>
<br>
	TO MARCELLINUS, MY NOBLE AND JUSTLY FAMOUS LORD, MY SON MOST BELOVED AND LONGED FOR, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    CHAP. I -- 1. In writing to the illustrious and most eloquent Volusianus, whom we both sincerely love, I thought it right to confine myself to answering the questions which he thought proper himself to state; but as to the questions which you have submitted to me in your letter for discussion and solution, as suggested or proposed either by Volusianus himself or by others, it is fitting that such reply to these as I may be able to give should be addressed to you. I shall attempt this, not in the manner in which it would require to be done in a formal treatise, but in the manner which is suitable to the conversational familiarity of a letter, in order that, if you, who know their state of mind by daily discussions, think it expedient, this letter also may be read to your friends. But if this communication be not adapted to them, because of their not being prepared by the piety of faith to give ear to it, let what you consider adapted to them be in the first place prepared between ourselves, and afterwards let what may have been thus prepared be communicated to them. For there are many things from which their minds may in the meantime shrink and recoil, which they may perhaps by and by be persuaded to accept as true, either by the use of more copious and skilful arguments, or by an appeal to authority which, in their opinion, may not without impropriety be resisted.<br>
    2. In your letter you state that some are perplexed by the question, "Why this God, who is proved to be the God also of the Old Testament, is pleased with new sacrifices after having rejected the ancient ones. For they allege that nothing can be corrected but that which is proved to have been previously not rightly done, or that what has once been done rightly ought not to be altered in the very least: that which has been rightly done, they say, cannot be changed without wrong."' I quote these words from your letter. Were I disposed to give a copious reply to this objection, time would fail me long before I had exhausted the instances in which the processes of nature itself and the works of men undergo changes according to the circumstances of, the time, while, at the same time, there is nothing mutable in the plan or principle by which these changes are regulated. Of these I may mention a few, that, stimulated by them, your wakeful observation may run, as it were, from them to many more of the same kind. Does not summer follow winter, the temperature gradually increasing in warmth? Do not night and day in turn succeed each other? How often do our own lives experience changes! Boyhood departing, never to return, gives place to youth; manhood, destined itself to continue only for a season, takes in turn the place of youth; and old age, closing the term of manhood, is itself closed by death? All these things are changed, but the plan of Divine Providence<br>
<br>
482<br>
<br>
which appoints these successive changes is not changed. I suppose, also, that the principles of agriculture are not changed when the farmer appoints a different work to be done in summer from that which he had ordered in winter. He who rises in the morning, after resting by night, is not supposed to have changed the plan of his life. The schoolmaster gives to the adult different tasks from those which he was accustomed to prescribe to the scholar in his boyhood his teaching, consistent throughout, changes the instruction when the lesson is changed, without itself being changed.<br>
    3. The eminent physician of our own times, Vindicianus, being consulted by an invalid, prescribed for his disease what seemed to him a suitable remedy at that time; health was restored by its use. Some years afterwards, finding himself troubled again with the same disorder, the patient supposed that the same remedy should be applied; but its application made his illness worse. In astonishment, he again returns to the physician, and tells him what had happened; whereupon he, being a man of very quick penetration, answered: "The reason of your having been harmed by this application is, that I did not order it;" upon which all who heard the remark and did not know the man supposed that he was trusting not in the art of medicine, but in some forbidden supernatural power. When he was afterwards questioned by some who were amazed at his words, he explained what they had not understood, namely, that he would not have prescribed the same remedy to the patient at t. he age which he had now attained. While, therefore, the principle J and methods of art remain unchanged, the change which, in accordance with them, may be made necessary by the difference of times is: very great.<br>
    4. To say then, that what has once been done rightly must in no respect whatever be changed, is to affirm what is not true. For if the circumstances of time which occasioned anything be changed, true reason in almost all cases demands that what had been in the former circumstances rightly done, be now so altered that, although they say that it is not rightly done if it be changed, truth, on the contrary, protests that it is not rightly done unless it be changed; because, at both times, it will be rightly done if the difference be regulated according to the difference in the times. For just as in the cases of different persons it may happen that, at the same moment, one man may do with impunity what another man may not, because of a difference not in the thing done but in the person who does it, so in the case of one and the same person at different times, that which was duty formerly is not duty now, not because the person is different from his former self, but because the time at which he does it is different.<br>
    5. The wide range opened up by this question may be seen by any one who is competent and careful to observe the contrast between the beautiful and the suitable, examples of which are i scattered, we may say, throughout the universe. For the beautiful, to which the ugly and deformed is opposed, is estimated and praised according to what it is in itself. But the suitable, to which the incongruous is opposed, depends on something else to which it is bound, and is estimated not according to what it is in itself, but according to that with which it is connected: the contrast, also, between becoming and unbecoming is either the same, or at least regarded as the same. Now apply what we have said to the subject in hand. The divine institution of sacrifice was suitable in the former dispensation, but is not suitable now. For the change suitable to the present age has been enjoined by God, who knows infinitely better than man what is fitting for every age, and who is, whether He give or add, abolish or curtail, increase or diminish, the unchangeable Governor as He is the uncHangeable Creator of mutable things, ordering all events in His providence until the beauty of the completed course of time, the component parts of which are the dispensations adapted to each successive age, shall be finished, like the grand melody of some ineffably wise master of song, and those pass into the eternal immediate contemplation of God who here, though it is a time of faith, not of sight, are acceptably worshipping Him.<br>
    6. They are mistaken, moreover, who think that God appoints these ordinances for His own advantage or pleasure; and no wonder that, being thus mistaken, they are perplexed, as if it was from a changing mood that He ordered one thing to be offered to Him in a former age, and something else now. But this is not the case. God enjoins nothing for His own advantage, but for the benefit of those to whom the injunction is given. Therefore He is truly Lord, for He does not need His servants, but His servants stand in need of Him. In those same Old Testament Scriptures, and in the age in which sacrifices were still being offered that are now abrogated, it is said: "I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God, for Thou dost not need my good things."' therefore God did not stand in need of those sacrifices, nor does He ever need anything; but there are certain acts, symbolical of these divine gifts, whereby the soul receives either present grace or eternal glory, in the celebration and practice of which, pious exercises, serviceable not to God but to ourselves, are performed.<br>
<br>
483<br>
<br>
    7. It would, however, take too long to discuss with adequate fulness the differences between the symbolical actions of former and present times, which, because of their pertaining to divine things, are called sacraments.' For as the man is not fickle who does one thing in the morning and another in the evening, one thing this month and another in the next, one thing this year and another next year, so there is no variableness with God, though in the former period of the world's history He enjoined one kind of offerings, and in the latter period another, therein ordering the symbolical actions pertaining to the blessed doctrine of true religion in harmony with the changes of successive epochs. without any change in Himself. For in order to let those whom these things perplex understand that tim change was already in the divine counsel, and that, when the new ordinances were ! appointed, it was not because the old had suddenly lost the divine approbation through inconstancy in His will, but that this had been already fixed and determined by the wisdom of that God to whom, in reference to much greater changes, these words are spoken in Scripture :l Thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same, it is necessary to convince them that this exchange of the sacraments of the Old Testament for those of the New had been predicted by the voices of the prophets. For thus they will see, if they can see anything, that what is new in time is not new in relation to Him who has appointed the tithes, and who possesses, without succession of time, all those things which He assigns according to their variety to the several ages. For in the psalm from which I have quoted above the words: "I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God, for Thou dost not need my good things," in proof that God does not need our sacrifices, it is added shortly after by the Psalmist in Christ's name: "I will not gather their assemblies of blood;"s that is, for tile offering of animals from their flocks, for which the Jewish assemblies were wont to be gathered together; and in another place he says: "I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat from thy folds; "4 and another prophet says: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out 'of the land of Egypt." s There are, besides these, many other testimonies on this subject in which it was foretold that God would do as He has done; but it would take too long to mention them.<br>
    8. If it is now established that that which was for one age rightly ordained may be in another age rightly changed,--the alteration indicating a change in the work, not in tile plan, of Him who makes the change, the plan being framed by His reasoning faculty, to which, unconditioned by succession in time, those things are simultaneously present which cannot be actually done at the same time because the ages succeed each other,--one might perhaps at this point expect to hear from me the causes of the change in question. You know how long it would take to discuss these fully. The matter may be stated summarily, but sufficiently for a man of shrewd judgment, in these words: It was fitting that Christ's future coming should be foretold by some sacraments, and that after His coming other sacraments should proclaim this; just as<br>
<br>
i the difference in the facts has compelled us to change the words .used by us in speaking of the advent as future or past: to be foretold is one thing, to be proclaimed is another, and to be about to come is one thing, to have come is another.<br>
    CHAP. II. -- 9. Let us now observed in the second place, what follows in your letter.6  You have added that they said that the Christian doctrine and preaching were in no way consistent with the duties and rights of citizens, because among its precepts we find: "Recompense to no man evil for evil," r and, "Whosoever shall smite thee on one cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also; and whosoever will compel thee to go a mile with him, go with him twain,'' s- all which are affirmed to be contrary to the duties and rights of citizens; for who would submit to have anything taken from him by an enemy, or forbear from retaliating the evils of war upon an invader who ravaged a Roman province? To these and similar statements of persons speaking slightingly, or perhaps I should rather say speaking as inquirers regarding the truth, I might have given a more elaborate answer, were it not that the persons with whom the discussion is carried on are men of liberal education. In addressing such, why should we prolong the debate, and not rather begin by inquiring for ourselves how it was possible that the Republic of Rome was governed and aggrandized from insignificance and poverty to greatness and opulence by men who, when they had suffered wrong, would rather pardon than punish the offender; 9<br>
<br>
484<br>
<br>
or how Cicero, addressing Caesar, the greatest statesman of his time, said, in praising his character, that he was wont to forget nothing but the wrongs which were done to him ?' For in this Cicero spoke either praise or flattery: if he spoke praise, it was because he knew Caesar to be such as he affirmed; if he spoke flattery, he showed that the chief magistrate of a commonwealth ought to do such things as he falsely commended in Caesar. But what is "not rendering' evil for evil," but refraining from the passion of revenge-in other words, choosing, when one has suffered wrong, to pardon rather than to punish the offender, and to forget nothing but the wrongs done to us ?<br>
    10. When these things are read in their own authors, they are received with loud applause; they are regarded as the record and recommendation of virtues in the practice of which the Republic deserved to hold sway over so many nations, because its citizens preferred to pardon rather than punish those who wronged them. But when the precept, "Render to no man evil for evil," is read as given by divine authority, and when, from the pulpits in our churches, this wholesome counsel is published in the midst of our congregations, or, as we might say, in places of instruction open to all, of both sexes and of all ages and ranks, our religion is accused as an enemy to the Republic ! Yet, were our religion listened to as it deserves, it would establish, consecrate, strengthen, and enlarge the commonwealth in a way beyond all that Romulus, Numa, Brutus, and all the other men of renown in Roman history achieved. For what' is a republic but a commonwealth? Therefore its interests are common to all; they are the interests of the State. Now what is a State but a multitude of men bound together by some bond of concord ? In one of their own authors we read: "What was a scattered and unsettled multitude had by concord become in a short time a State." But what exhortations to concord have they ever appointed to be read in their temples ? So far from this, they were unhappily compelled to devise how they might worship without giving offence to any of their gods, who were all at such variance among themselves, that, had their worshippers imitated their quarrelling, the State must have fallen to pieces for want of the bond of concord, as it soon afterwards began to do through civil wars, when the morals of the people were changed and corrupted.<br>
    11. But who, even though he be a stranger to our religion, is so deaf as not to know how many precepts enjoining concord, not invented by the discussions of men, but written with the authority of God, are continually read in the churches of Christ? For this is tim tendency even of those precepts which they are much more willing to debate than to follow: "That to him who smites us on one cheek we should offer the other to be smitten; to him who would take away our coat we should give our cloak also; and that with him who' compels us to go one mile we should go twain." For these things are done only that a wicked man may be overcome by kindness, or rather that the evil which is in the wicked man may be overcome by good, and that the man may be delivered from the evil-not from any evil that is external and foreign to himself, but from that which is within and is his own, under which he suffers loss more severe and fatal than could be inflicted by the cruelty of any enemy from without. He, therefore, who is overcoming evil by good, submits patiently to the loss of temporal advantages, that he may show how those things, through excessive love of which the other is made wicked, deserve to be despised when compared with faith and righteousness; in order that so the injurious person may learn from him whom he wronged what is the true nature of the things for the sake of which he committed the wrong, and may be won back with sorrow for his sin to that concord, than which nothing is more serviceable to the State, being overcome not by the strength of one passionately resenting, but by the good-nature of one patiently bearing wrong. For then it is rightly done when it seems that it will benefit him for whose sake it is done, by producing in him amendment of his ways and concord with others. At all events, it is to be done with this intention, even though the result may be different from what was expected, and the man, with a view to whose correction and conciliation this healing and salutary medicine, so to speak, was employed, refuses to be corrected and reconciled.<br>
    12. Moreover, if we pay attention to the words of the precept, and consider ourselves under bondage to the literal interpretation, the right cheek is not to be presented by us if the left has been smitten. "Whosoever," it is said, "shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also; "' but the left cheek is more liable to be smitten, because it is easier for the right hand of the assailant to smite it than the other. But the words are commonly understood as if our Lord had said: If any one has acted injuriously to thee in respect of the higher possessions which thou hast, offer to him also the inferior possessions, lest, being more concerned about revenge than about forbearance, thou shouldst despise eternal things in comparison with temporal things, whereas temporal things<br>
<br>
485<br>
<br>
ought to be despised in comparison with eternal things, as the left is in comparison with the right. This has been always the aim of the holy martyrs; for final vengeance is righteously! demanded only when there remains no room for amendment, namely, in the last great judgment. Rut meanwhile we must be on our guard, lest, through desire for revenge, we lose patience itself, -- a virtue which is of more value than all which an enemy can, in spite of our resistance, take away from us. For another evangelist, in recording the same precept, makes no mention of the right cheek, but names .merely the one and the other; ' so that, while the duty may be somewhat more distinctly learned from Matthew's gospel, he simply commends the same exercise of patience. Wherefore a righteous and pious man ought to be prepared to endure with patience injury from those whom he desires to make good, so that the number of good men may be increased, instead of himself being added, by retaliation of injury, to the number of wicked men.<br>
    13. In fine, that these precepts pertain rather to the inward disposition of the heart than to the actions which ate done in the sight of men, requiring us, in the inmost heart, to cherish patience along with benevolence, but in the outward action to do that which seems most likely to benefit those whose good we ought to seek, is manifest from the fact that our Lord Jesus Himself, our perfect example of patience, when He was smitten on the face, answered: "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil, but if not, why smitest thou me ? "$ If we look only to the words, He did not in this obey His own precept, for He did not present the other side of his face to him who had smitten Him but, on the contrary, prevented him who hac . done the wrong from adding thereto; and yet He had come prepared not only to be smitten on the face, but even to be slain upon the cross for those at whose hands He suffered crucifixion, and for whom, when hanging on the cross, He prayed, "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do ! "3 In like manner, the Apostle Paul seems to have failed to obey the precept of his Lord and Master, when he, being smitten on the face as He had been, said to the chief priest: "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall, for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the! law ? ," And when it was said by them that stood near, "Revilest thou God's high priest?" he took pains sarcastically to indicate what his words meant, that those of them who were discerning might understand that now the whited wall, i.e. the hypocrisy of the Jewish priesthood, was appointed to be thrown down by the coming of Christ; for He said: "I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest, for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people;"4 although it is perfectly certain that he who had grown up in that nation and bad been in that place trained in the law, could not but know that his judge was the chief priest, and could not, by professing ignorance on this point, impose upon those to whom he was so well known.<br>
    14. These precepts concerning patience ought to be always retained in the habitual discipline of the heart, and the benevolence which prevents the recompensing of evil for evil must be always fully cherished in the disposition. At the same time, many things must be done in correcting with a certain benevolent severity, even against their own wishes, men whose welfare rather than their wishes it is our duty to consult and the Christian Scriptures have most unambiguously commended this virtue in a magistrate.' For in the correction of a so, even with some sternness, there is assuredly no diminution of a father's love; yet, in the correction, that is done which is received with reluctance and pain by one whom it seems necessary to heal by pain. And on this principle, if the commonwealth observe the precepts of the Christian religion, even its wars themselves will not be carried on without the benevolent design that, after the resisting nations have been conquered, provision may be more easily made for enjoying in peace the mutual bond of piety and justice. For the person from whom is taken away the freedom which he abuses in doing i wrong is vanquished with benefit to himself; since nothing is more truly a misfortune than that good fortune of offenders, by which pernicious impunity is maintained, and the evil disposition, like an enemy within the man, is strengthened. But the perverse and froward . hearts of men think human affairs are prosperous when men are concerned about magnificent mansions, and indifferent to the ruin of souls; when mighty theatres are built up, and the foundations of virtue are undermined; when the madness of extravagance is highly esteemed, and works of mercy are scorned; when, out of , the wealth and affluence of rich men, luxurious provision is made for actors, and the poor are . grudged the necessaries of life; when that God !who, by the public declarations of His doctrine, protests against public vice, is blasphemer by impious communities, which demand gods of such character that even those theatrical representations which bring disgrace to both body<br>
<br>
486<br>
<br>
and soul are fitly performed in honour of them. If God permit these things to prevail, He is in that permission showing more grievous displeasure: if He leave these crimes unpunished, such impunity is a more terrible judgment. When, on the other hand, He overthrows the props of vice, and reduces to poverty those lusts which were nursed by plenty, He afflicts in mercy. And in mercy, also, if such a thing were possible, even wars might be waged by the good, in order that, by bringing under the yoke the unbridled lusts of men, those vices might be abolished which ought, under a just government, to be either extirpated or suppressed.<br>
    15. For if the Christian religion condemned wars of every kind, the command given in the gospel to soldiers asking counsel as to salvation would rather be to cast away their arms, and withdraw themselves wholly from military service; whereas the word spoken to such was, "Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages," 'the command to be content with their wages! manifestly implying no prohibition to continue m the service. Wherefore, let those who say that the doctrine of Christ is incompatible with the State's well-being, give us an army composed of soldiers such as the doctrine of Christ requires them to be; let them give us such subjects, such husbands and wives, such parents! and children, such masters and servants, such! kings, such judges--in fine, even such taxpayers and tax-gatherers, as the Christian religion has taught that men should be, and then let them dare to say that it is adverse to the State's well-being; yea, rather, let them no longer hesitate to confess that this doctrine, if it were obeyed, would be the salvation of the commonwealth.<br>
    CHAP. III -- 16. But what am I to answer to the assertion made that many calamities have befallen the Roman Empire through some Christian emperors? This sweeping accusation is a calumny. For if they would more clearly quote some indisputable facts in support of it from the history of past emperors, I also could mention similar, perhaps even greater calamities in the reigns of other emperors who were not Christians; so that men may understand that these were either faults in the men, not in their religion, or were due not to the emperors themselves, but to others without whom emperors can do nothing. As to the date of the commencement of the downfall of the Roman Republic, there is ample evidence; their own literature speaks plainly as to this. Long before the name of Christ had shone abroad on the earth, this was said of Rome: "0 venal city, and doomed to perish speedily, if only it could find a purchaser!"2 In his book on the Catilinarian conspiracy, which was before the coming of Christ, the same most illustrious Roman historian declares plainly the time when the army of the Roman people began to be wanton and drunken; to set a high value on statues, paintings, and embossed vases; to take these by violence both from individuals and from the State; to rob temples and pollute everything, sacred and profane. When, therefore, the avarice and grasping violence of the corrupt and abandoned manners of the time spared neither men nor those whom they esteemed as gods, the famous honour and safety of the commonwealth began to decline. What progress the worst vices made from that time forward, and with how great mischief to the interests of mankind the wickedness of the Empire went on, it would take too long to rehearse. Let them hear their own satirist speaking playfully yet truly thus: --<br>
  	Once poor, and therefore chaste, in former times Our matrons were no luxury found room In low-roofed houses and bare walls of loam; Their hands with labour burdened while 'tis light, A frugal sleep supplied the quiet night;<br>
While, pinched with want, their hunger held them strait, When Hannibal was hovering at the gate; But wanton now, and lolling at our ease, We suffer all the inveterate ills of peace And wasteful riot, whose destructive charms Revenge the vanquished world of our victorious arms. No crime, no lustful postures are unknown, Since poverty, our guardian-god, is gone." s<br>
<br>
Why, then, do you expect me to multiply examples of the evils which were brought in by wickedness uplifted by prosperity, seeing that among themselves, those who observed events with somewhat' closer attention discerned that Rome had more reason to regret the departure of its poverty than of its opulence; because in its poverty the integrity of its virtue was secured, but through its opulence, dire corruption, more terrible than any invader, had taken violent possession not of the walls of the city, but of the mind of the State ?<br>
    17. Thanks be unto the Lord our God, who has sent unto us unprecedented help in resisting these evils. For whither might not men have been carried away by that flood of the appalling wickedness of the human race, whom would it have spared, and in what depths would it not have engulfed its victims, had not the cross of Christ, resting on such a solid rock of authority (so to speak), been planted too high add too strong for the flood to sweep it away ? so that by laying hold of its strength we may become stedfast, and not be carried off our feet and overwhelmed in the mighty whirlpool of the<br>
<br>
487<br>
<br>
evil counsels and evil impulses of this world. For when the empire was sinking in the vile abyss of utterly depraved manners, and of the effete ancient religion, it was signally important that heavenly authority should come to the rescue, persuading men to the practice of voluntary poverty, continence, benevolence, justice, and concord among themselves, as well as true piety towards God, and all the other bright and sterling virtues of life, -- not only with a view to the I spending of this present life in the most honourable way, nor only with a view to secure the most t perfect bond of concord m the earthly common wealth, but also in order to the obtaining of eternal salvation, and a place in the divine and! celestial republic of a people which shall endure for ever--a republic to the citizenship of which faith, hope, and charity admit us; so that, while absent from it on our pilgrimage here, we may patiently tolerate, if we cannot correct, those who desire, by leaving vices unpunished, to give stability to that republic which the early Romans founded and enlarged by their virtues, when, though they had not the true piety towards the true God which could bring them, by a religion of saving power, to the commonwealth which ii eternal, they did nevertheless observe a certain integrity of its' own kind, which might suffice for founding, enlarging, and preserving an earthly commonwealth. For m the most opulent and illustrious' Empire of Rome, God has shown how great is the influence of even civil virtues without true religion, in order that it might be understood that, when this is added to such virtues, men are made citizens of another commonwealth, of which the king is Truth, the law is Love, and the duration is Eternity.<br>
    CHAP. IV. -- 18. Who can help feeling that there is something simply ridiculous in their attempt to compare with Christ, or rather to put in a higher place, Apollonius and Apuleius, and others who were most skilful in magical arts? Yet this is to be tolerated with less impatience, because they bring into comparison with Him these men rather than their own gods; for Apollonius was, as we must admit, a much worthier character than that author and perpetrator of innumerable gross acts of immorality whom they call Jupiter. "These legends about our gods," they reply, "are fables." Why, then, do they go on praising that luxurious, licentious, and manifestly profane prosperity of the Republic, which invented these infamous crimes of the gods, and not only left them to reach the ears of men as fables, but also exhibited them to the eyes of men in the theatres; in which, more numerous than their deities were the crimes which the gods themselves were well pleased to see openly perpetrated in their honour, whereas they should have punished their worshippers for even tolerating such spectacles? "But," they reply, "those are not the gods themselves whose worship is celebrated according to the lying invention of such fables." Who, then, are they who are propitiated by the practising in worship of such abominations? Because, forsooth, Christianity has exposed the perversity and chicanery of those devils, by whose power also magical arts deceive the minds of men, and because it has made this patent to the world, and, having brought out the distinction between the holy angels and these malignant adversaries, has warned men to be on their guard against them, showing them also how this may be done, -- it is called an enemy to the Republic, as if, even though temporal prosperity could be secured by their aid, and, amount of adversity would not be preferable to the prosperity obtained through such means. And yet it pleased God to prevent men from being perplexed in this matter; for in the age of the comparative darkness of the Old Testament, in which is the covering of the New Testament, He distinguished the first nation which worshiped the true God and despised false gods by such remarkable prosperity in this world, that any. ode may perceive from l. heir case that prosperity is not at the disposal of devils, but only of Him whom angels serve and devils fear.<br>
    19. Apuleius (of whom I choose rather to speak, because, as our own countryman, he is better known to us Africans), though born in a place of some note,' and a man of superior education and great eloquence, never succeeded, with all his magical arts, in reaching, I do not say the supreme power, but even any subordinate office as a magistrate in the Empire. Does it seem probable that he, as a philosopher, voluntarily despised these things, who, being the priest of a province, was so ambitious of greatness that he gave spectacles of gladiatorial combats, provided the dresses worn by those who fought with wild beasts in the circus, and, in order to get a statue of himself erected in the town of Coea, the birthplace of his wife, appealed to law against the opposition made by some of the citizens to the proposal, and then, to prevent this from being forgotten by posterity, published the speech delivered by him on that occasion? I So far, therefore, as concerns worldly prosperity, I that magician did his utmost in order to success; 'whence it is manifest that he failed not because he was not wishful, but because he was not able I to do more. At the same time we admit that the defended himself with brilliant eloquence against some who imputed to him the crime of practising magical arts which makes me wonder<br>
<br>
488<br>
<br>
at his panegyrists, who, in affirming that by these arts he wrought some miracles, attempt to bring evidence contradicting his own defence of himself from the charge. Let them, however, examine whether, indeed, they are bringing true testimony, and he was guilty of pleading what he knew to be false. Those who pursue magical arts only with a view to worldly prosperity or from an accursed curiosity, and those also who, though innocent of such arts, nevertheless praise them with a dangerous admiration, I would exhort to give heed, if they be wise, and to observe how, without any such arts, the position of a shepherd was exchanged for the dignity of the kingly office by David, of whom Scripture has faithfully recorded both the sinful and the meritorious actions, in order that we might know both how to avoid offending God, and how, when He has been offended, His wrath may be appeased.<br>
    20. As to those miracles, however, which are performed in order to excite the wonder of men, they do greatly err who compare heathen magicians with the holy prophets, who completely eclipse them by the fame of their great miracles. How much more do they err if they compare them with Christ, of whom the prophets, so incomparably superior to magicians of every name, foretold that He would come both in the human nature, which he took in being born of the Virgin, and in the divine nature, in which He is never separated from the Father !<br>
    I see that I have written a very long letter, and yet have not said all concerning Christ which might meet the case either of those who from sluggishness of intellect are unable to comprehend divine things, or of those who, though endowed with acuteness, are kept back from discerning truth through their love of contradiction and the prepossession of their minds in favour of long-cherished error. Howbeit, take note of anything which influences them against our doctrine, and write to me again, so that, if the Lord help us, we may, by letters or by treatises, furnish an answer to all their objections. May you, by the grace and mercy of the Lord, be happy in Him;my noble and justly distinguished lord, my son dearly beloved and longed fort<br>

                            LETTER CXXXIX.<br>
                              (A.D. 412.)<br>
	TO MARCELLINUS, MY LORD JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED MY SON VERY MUCH BELOVED AND LONGED FOR AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. The Acts1 which your Excellency promised to send I am eagerly expecting, and I am longing to have them read as soon as possible in the church at Hippo, and also, if it can be done, in all the churches established within the diocese, that all may hear and become thoroughly familiar with the men who have confessed their crimes, not because the fear of God subdued them to repentance, but because the rigour of their judges broke through the hardness of their most cruel hearts, -- some of them confessing to the murder of one presbyter [Restitutus], and the blinding and maiming of another [Innocentius]; others not daring to deny that they might have known of these outrages, although they say that they disapproved of them, and persisting in the impiety of schism in fellowship with such a multitude of atrocious villains, while deserting the I peace of the Catholic Church on the pretext of unwillingness to be polluted by other men's i crimes; others declaring that they will not forsake the schismatics, even though the certainty of Catholic truth and the perversity of the Donatists have been demonstrated to them. The work, which it has pleased God to entrust to your diligence, is of great importance. My heart's desire is, that many similar Donatist cases may be tried and decided by you as these have been, and that in this way the crimes and the insane obstinacy of these men may be often brought to light; and that the Acts recording : these proceedings may be published, and brought !to the knowledge of all men.<br>
    As to the statement in your Excellency's letter, that you are uncertain whether you ought to command the said Acts to be published in Theoprepia,2 my reply is, Let this be done, if a large multitude of hearers can be gathered there; if this be not the case, some other place of more general resort must be provided; it must not, however, be omitted on any account.<br>
    2. As to the punishment of these men, I beseech you to make it something less severe than sentence of death, although they have, by their own confession, been guilty of such grievous crimes. I ask this out of a regard both for our own consciences and for the testimony thereby given to Catholic clemency. For this is the special advantage secured to us by their confession, that the Catholic Church has found an opportunity of maintaining and exhibiting forbearance towards her most violent enemies; since in a case where such cruelty was practised, any punishment short of death will be seen by all men to proceed from great leniency. And although such treatment appears to some of our communion, whose minds are agitated by these atrocities, to be less than the crimes deserve, and to have somewhat the aspect of weakness and dereliction of duty, nevertheless, when the feelings, which are wont to be immoderately ex-<br>
489<br>
<br>
cited while such events are recent, have subsided after a time, the kindness shown to the guilty will shine with most conspicuous brightness, and men will take much more pleasure in reading these Acts and showing them to others, my lord justly distinguished, and son very much beloved and longed for.<br>
    My holy brother and co-bishop Boniface is on the spot, and I have forwarded by the deacon Peregrinus, who travelled along with him, a letter of instructions; accept these as representing me. And whatever may seem in your joint opinion to be for the Church's interest, let it be done with the help of the Lord, who is able in the midst of so great evils graciously to succour you. One of their bishops, Macrobius, is at present going round in all directions, followed by bands of wretched men and women, and has opened for himself the [Donatist] churches which fear, however slight, had moved their owners to close for a time. By the presence, however, of one whom I have commended and again heartily commend to your love, namely, Spondeus, the deputy of the illustrious Celer, their presumption was indeed somewhat checked; but now, since his departure to Carthage, Macrobius has opened the Donatist churches ever within his property, and is gathering congregations for worship in them. In his company',' moreover, is Donatus, a deacon, rebaptized by them even when he was a tenant of lands belonging to the Church, who was implicated as a ringleader in the outrage Ion Innocentius]. When this man is his associate, who can tell what kind of followers may be in his retinue ? If the sentence on these men is to be pronounced by the Proconsul,' or by both of you together, and if he perchance insist upon inflicting capital punishment, although he is a Christian and, so far as we have had opportunity of observing, not disposed to such severity -- if, I say, his determination make it necessary, order those letters of mine, which I deemed it my duty to address to you severally on this subject,2 to be brought before you while the trial is still going on; for I am accustomed to hear that it is in the power of the judge to mitigate the sentence, and inflict a milder penalty than the law prescribes. If, however, notwithstanding these letters from me, he refuse to grant this request, let him at least allow that the men be remanded for a time; and we will endeavour to obtain this concession from the clemency of the Emperors, so that the sufferings of the martyrs, which ought to shed bright glory on the Church, may not be tarnished by the blood of their enemies; for I know that in the case of the clergy in the valley of Anaunia,3 who were slain by the Pagans, and are now honoured as martyrs, the Emperor granted readily a petition that the murderers, who had been discovered and imprisoned, might not be visited with a capital punishment.<br>
    3. As to the books concerning the baptism of infants, of which I had sent the original manuscript to your Excellency, I have forgotten for what reason I received them again from you; unless, perhaps, it was that, 'after examining them, I found them faulty, and wished to make some corrections, which, by reason of extraordinary hindrances, I have not yet been able to overtake. I must also confess that the letter intended to be addressed to you and added to these books, and which I had begun to dictate when I was with you, is still unfinished, little having been added to it since that time. If, however, I could set before you a statement of the toil which it is absolutely necessary for me to devote, both by day and by night, to other duties, you would deeply sympathize with me, and would be astonished at the amount of business not admitting of delay which distracts my mind and hinders me from accomplishing those .things to which you urge me in entreaties and admonitions, addressed to one most willing to oblige you, and inexpressibly grieved that it is beyond his power; for when I obtain a little leisure from the urgent necessary business of those men, who so press me into their service 4 that I am neither able to escape them nor at liberty to neglect them, there are always subjects to which I must, in dictating to my amanuenses, give the first place, because they are so connected with the present hour as not to admit of being postponed. Of such things one instance was the abridgement of the proceedings at our Conference,s a work involving much labour, but necessary, because I saw that no one would attempt the perusal of such a mass of writing; another was a letter to the Donatist laity 6 concerning the said Conference, a document which I have just completed, after labouring at it for several nights; another was the composition of two long letters? one addressed to yourself, my beloved friend, the other to the illustrious Volusianus, which I suppose you both have received; another is a book, with which I am occupied at present, addressed to our friend Honoratus,8 in regard to five questions proposed by him in a letter to me, and you see that to him I was unquestionably in duty bound to send a prompt<br>

reply. For love deals with her sons as a nurse does with children, devoting her attention to them not in the order of the love felt for each, but according to the urgency of each case; she gives a preference to the weaker, because she -desires to impart to them such strength as is possessed by the stronger, whom she passes by meanwhile not because of her slighting them, but because her mind is at rest in regard to them. Emergencies of this kind, compelling me to employ my amanuenses in writing on subjects which prevent me from using their pens in: work much more congenial to tile ardent desires l of my heart, can never fail to occur, because I have difficulty in obtaining even a very little leisure, amidst the accumulation of business into which, in spite of my own inclinations, I am dragged by other men's wishes or necessities; and what I am to do, I really do not know.<br>
    4. You have heard the burdens, for my deliverance from which I wish you to join your prayers with mine; but at the same time I do not wish you to desist from admonishing me, as you do, with such importunity and frequency; your words are not without some effect. I commend at the same time to your Excellency a church planted in Numidia, on behalf of which, in its present necessities, my holy brother and co-bishop Delphinus has been sent by my brethren and co-bishops who share the toils and the dangers of their work in that region. I no more on this matter, because you will hear all from his own lips when he comes to you. All other necessary particulars you will find in the letters of instruction, which are sent by me to the presbyter either now or by the deacon Peregrinus, so that I need not again repeat them.&nbsp;<br>
    May your heart be ever strong in Christ, my lord justly distinguished, and son very much beloved and longed for !<br>
    I commend to your Excellency our son Ruffinus, the Provost. of Cirta.<br>

<br>
                              (A.D. 412.)<br>
<br>
	TO MARCELLINUS, MY NOBLE LORD, JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED, MY SON VERY MUCH BELOVED, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. Desiring to reply to the letter which I received from you through our holy brother, my co-bishop Boniface, I have sought for it, but have not found it. I have recalled to mind, however, that you asked me in that letter how the magicians of Pharaoh could, after all the water of Egypt had been turned into blood, find any with which to imitate the miracle. There are two ways in which the question is commonly answered: either that it was possible for water to have been brought from the sea, or, which is more credible, that these plagues were not inflicted on the district in which the children of Israel were; for the clear, express statements to this effect in some parts of that scriptural narrative entitle us to assume this in places where the statement is omitted.<br>
    2. In your other letter, brought to me by the presbyter Urbanus, a question is proposed, taken from a passage not in the Divine Scriptures, but in one of my own books, namely, that which I wrote on Free Will. On questions of this kind, however, I do not bestow much labour; because. even if the statement objected to does not admit of unanswerable vindication, it is mine only; it is not an utterance of that Author whose words it is impiety to reject, even when, through our misapprehension of their meaning, the interpretation which we put on them deserves to be rejected. I freely confess, accordingly, that I endeavour to be one of those who write because they have made some progress, and who, by-means of writing, make further progress. If,<br>
therefore, through inadvertence or want of knowledge, anything has been stated by me which may with good reason be condemned, not only by others who are able to discover this, but also by myself (for if I am making progress, I ought, at least after it has been pointed out, to see it), such a mistake is not to be regarded with surprise or grief, but rather forgiven, and made the occasion of congratulating me, not, of course, on having erred, but on having renounced an error. For there is an extravagant perversity in the self-love of the man who desires other men to be in error, that the fact of his having erred may not be discovered. How much better and more profitable is it that in the points in which he has erred others should not err, so that he may be delivered from his error by their advice, or, if he refuse this, may at least have no followers in his error. For, if God permit me, as I desire, to gather together and point out, in a work devoted to this express purpose, all the things which most justly displease me in my books, men will then see how far I am from being a partial judge in my own case.<br>
    3. As for you, however, who love me warmly, if, in opposing those by whom, whether through malice or ignorance or superior intelligence, I am censured, you maintain the position that I have nowhere in my writings made a mistake, you labour in a hopeless enterprise- you have undertaken a bad cause, in which, even if myself were judge, you must be easily worsted; for it is no pleasure to me that my dearest friends should think me to be such as I am not, since assuredly they love not me, but instead of me<br>
<br>
491<br>
<br>
another under my name, if they love not what I am, but what I am not; for in so far as they know me, or believe what is true concerning me, I am loved by them; but in so far as they ascribe to me what they do not know to be in me, they love another person, such as they suppose me to be. Cicero, the prince of Roman orators, says of some one, "He never uttered a word which he would wish to recall." This commendation, though it seems to be the highest possible, is nevertheless more likely to be true of a consummate fool than of a man perfectly wise; for it is true of idiots,' that the more absurd and foolish they are, and the more their opinions diverge from those universally held, the more likely are they to utter no word which they will wish to recall; for to regret an evil, or foolish, or ill-timed word is characteristic of a wise man. If, however, the words quoted are taken in a good sense, as intended to make us believe that some one was such that, by reason of his speaking all things wisely, he never uttered any word which he would wish to recall,- this we are, in accordance with sound piety, to believe rather concerning men of God, who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, than concerning the man whom Cicero commends. For my part, so far am I from this excellence, that if I have uttered no word which I would wish to recall, it must be because I resemble more the idiot than the wise man. The man whose writings are most worthy of the highest authority is he who has uttered no word, I do not say which it would: be his desire, but which it would be his duty to i recall. Let him that has not attained to this! occupy the second rank through his humility, I since he cannot take the first rank through his wisdom. Since he has been unable, with all his: care, to exclude every. expression whose use may i be justly regretted, let him acknowledge his regret for anything which, as he may now have discovered, ought not to have been said.<br>
    4. Since, therefore, the words spoken by me which I would if I could recall, are not, as my very dear friends suppose, few or none, but perhaps even more than my enemies imagine, I am not gratified by such commendation as Cicero's sentence, "He never uttered a word which he would wish to recall," but I am deeply distressed by the saying of Horace, "The word once uttered cannot be recalled."2 This is the reason why I keep beside me, longer than you wish or patiently bear, the books which I have written on difficult and important questions on the book of Genesis and the doctrine of the Trinity, hoping that, if it be impossible to avoid having some things which may deservedly be found fault with, the number of these may at least be smaller than it might have been, if, through impatient haste, the works had been published without due deliberation; for you, as your letters indicate (our holy brother and co-bishop Florentius having written me to this effect), are urgent for the publication of these works now, in order that they may be defended in my own lifetime by myself, when, perhaps, they may begin to be assailed in some particulars, either through the cavilling of enemies or the misapprehensions of friends. You say this doubtless because you think there is nothing in them which might with justice be censured, otherwise you would not exhort me to publish the books, but rather to revise them more carefully. But I fix my eye rather on those who are true judges, sternly impartial, between whom and myself I wish, in the first place, to make sure of my ground, so that the only faults coming to be censured by them may be those which it was impossible for me to observe, though using the most diligent scrutiny.<br>
    5. Notwithstanding what I have just said, I am prepared to defend the sentence in the third book of my treatise on Free Will, in which, discoursing on the rational substance, I have expressed my opinion in these words: "The soul, appointed to occupy a body inferior in nature to itself after the entrance of sin, governs its own body, not absolutely according to its free will, but only in so far as the laws of the universe permit." I bespeak the particular attention of those who think that I have here fixed and defined, as ascertained concerning the human soul, either that it comes by propagation from the parents, or that it has, through sins committed in a higher celestial life, incurred the penalty of being shut up in a corruptible body. Let them, I say, observe that the words in question have been so carefully weighed by me, that while they hold fast what I regard as certain, namely, that after the sin of the first man, all other men. have been born and continue to be born in that sinful flesh, for the healing of which "the likeness of sinful flesh "s came in the person of the Lord, they are also so chosen as not to pronounce upon' any one of those four opinions which I have in the sequel expounded and distinguished--not attempting to establish any one of them as preferable to the others, but disposing in the meantime of the matter under discussion, and reserving the consideration of these opinions, so that whichever of them may be true, praise should unhesitatingly be given to God.<br>
    6. For whether all souls are derived by propagation from the first, or are in the case of each individual specially created, or being created apart from the body are sent into it, or introduce themselves into it of their own accord, without doubt<br>
<br>
492<br>
<br>
this creature endowed with reason, namely, the human soul- appointed to occupy an inferior, that is, an earthly body- after the entrance of sin, does not govern its own body absolutely according to its free will.' For I did not say, "after his sin," or "after he sinned," but after the entrance of sin, that whatever might afterwards, if possible, be determined by reason as to the question whether the sin was his own or the sin of the first parent of mankind, it might be perceived that in saying that "the soul, appointed, after the entrance of sin, to occupy an inferior body, does not govern its body absolutely according to its own free will," I stated what is true; for "the flesh lusteth against the spirit,' and in this we groan, being burdened," 3 and "the corruptible body weighs down the soul,': 4_ in short, who can enumerate all the evils arising from the infirmity of the flesh, which shall assuredly cease when "this corruptible shall have put on incorruption," so that "that which is mortal shall be swallowed up of life" ?s In that future condition, therefore, the soul shall govern its spiritual body with absolute freedom of will; but in the meantime its freedom is not absolute, but conditioned by the laws of the universe, according to which -it is fixed, that bodies having experienced birth experience death, and having grown to maturity decline in old age. For the soul of the first man did, before the entrance of sin, govern his body with perfect freedom of will, although that body was not yet spiritual, but animal; but after the entrance of sin, that is, after sin had been committed in that flesh from which sinful flesh was thenceforward to be propagated, the reasonable soul is so appointed to occupy an inferior body, that it does not govern its body with absolute freedom of will. That infant children, even before they have committed any sin of their own, are partakers of sinful flesh, is, in my opinion, proved by their requiring to have it healed in them also, by the application in their baptism of the remedy provided in Him who came in the likeness of sinful flesh. But even those who do not acquiesce in this view have no just ground for taking offence at the sentence quoted from my book; for it is certain, if I am not mistaken. that even if the infirmity be the consequence not of sin, but of nature, it was at all events only after the entrance of sin that bodies having this infirmity began to be produced; for Adam was not created thus, and he did not beget any offspring before he sinned.<br>
    7. Let my critics, therefore, seek other passages to censure, not only in my other more hastily published works, but also in these books of mine on Free Will. For I by no means deny that they may in this search discover opportunities of conferring a benefit on me; for if the books, having passed into so many hands, cannot now be corrected, I myself may, being still alive. Those words, however, so carefully selected by me to avoid committing myself to any one of the four opinions or theories regarding the soul's origin, are liable to censure only from those who think that my hesitation as to any definite view in a matter so obscure is blameworthy; against whom I do not defend myself by saying that I think it right to pronounce no opinion whatever on the subject, seeing that I have no doubt either that the soul is immortal -- not in the same sense in which God is immortal, who alone hath immortality,6 but in a certain way peculiar to itself--or that the soul is a creature and not ' a part of the substance of the Creator, or as to any other thing which I regard as most certain ' concerning its nature. But seeing that the obscurity of this most mysterious subject, the origin of the soul, compels me to do as I have done, let them rather stretch out a friendly hand to me, confessing my ignorance, and desiring to know whatever is the truth on the subject; and let them, if they can, teach or demonstrate to me what they may either have learned by the exercise of sound reason, or have believed on indisputably plain testimony of the divine oracles. For if reason be found contradicting the authority of Divine Scriptures, it only deceives by a semblance of truth, however acute it be, for its deductions cannot in that case be true. On the other hand, if, against the most manifest and reliable testimony of reason, anything be set up claiming to have the authority of the Holy Scriptures, he who does this does it through a misapprehension of what he has read, and is setting up against the truth not the real meaning of Scripture, which he has failed to discover, but an opinion of his own; he alleges not what he has found in the Scriptures, but what he has found in himself as their interpreter.<br>
    8. Let me give an example, to which I solicit l your earnest attention. In a passage near the end of Ecclesiastes, where the author is speak-ling of man's dissolution through death separating the soul from the body, it is written, "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." 7 A statement having the authority on which this one is based is true beyond all dispute, and is not intended to deceive any one; yet if any one wishes to put upon it such an interpretation as may help him in attempting to support the theory of the propagation of souls, according to<br>
<br>
493<br>
<br>
which all other souls are derived from that one which God gave to the first man, what is there said concerning the body under the name of "dust" (for obviously nothing else than body and soul are to be understood by "dust" and "spirit" in this passage) seems to favour his view; for he may affirm that the soul is said to return to God because of its being derived from the original stock of that soul which God gave to the first man, in the same way as the body is said to return to the dust because of its being derived from the original stock of that body which was made of dust in the first man and therefore may argue that, from what we know perfectly as to the body, we ought to believe what is hidden from our observation as to the soul; for there is no difference of opinion as to the original stock of the body, but there is as to the original stock of the soul. In the text thus brought forward as a proof, statements are made concerning both, as if the manner of the return of each to its original was precisely similar in both,- the body, on the one hand, returning to the earth as it was, for thence was it taken when the first man was formed; the soul, on the other hand, returning to God, for He gave it when He breathed into the nostrils of the man whom He had formed the breath of life, and he became a living soul,' so that thenceforward the propagation of each part should go on from the corresponding part in the parent.<br>
    9. If, however, the true account of the soul's origin be, that God gives to each individual man a soul, not propagated from that first soul, but created in some other way, the statement that the "spirit returns to God who gave it," is equally consistent with this view. The two other opinions regarding the soul's origin are, then, the only ones which seem to be excluded by this text. For in the first place, as to the opinion that every man's soul is made separately within him at the time of his creation, it is supposed that, if this were the case, the soul should have been spoken of as returning, not to God who gave it, but to God who made it; for the word "gave" seems to imply that that which could be given had already a separate existence. The words "returneth to God" are further insisted upon by some, who say, How could it return to a place where it had never been before ? Accordingly they maintain that, if the soul is to be believed to have never been with God before, the words should have been "it goes," or "goes on," or "goes away," rather than it" returns" to God. In like manner, as to the opinion that each soul glides of its own accord into its body, it is not easy to explain how this theory is reconcilable with the statement that God gave it. The words of this scriptural passage are consequently somewhat adverse to these two opinions, namely, the one which supposes each soul to be created in its own body, and the one which supposes each soul to introduce itself into its own body spontaneously. But there is no difficulty in showing that the words are consistent with either of the other two opinions, namely, that all souls are derived by propagation from the one first created, or that, having been created and kept in readiness with God, they are given to each body as required.<br>
    10. Nevertheless, even if the theory that each soul is created in its own body may not be wholly excluded by this text, -- for if its advocates affirm that God is here said to have given the spirit (or the soul) in the same way as He is said to have given us eyes, ears, hands, or other such members, which were not made elsewhere by Him, and kept in store that He might give them, i.e. add and join them to our bodies, but are made by Him in that body to which He is said to have given them,- I do not see what could be said in reply, unless, perchance, the opinion could be refuted, either by other passages of Scripture, or by valid reasoning. In like manner, those who think that each soul flows of its own accord into its body take the words"' God gave it" in the&nbsp;<br>
sense in which it is said, "He gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts."a Only one word, therefore, remains apparently irreconcilable with the theory that each soul is made in its own . body, namely, the word "returneth," in the expression "returneth to God;" for in what sense can the soul return to Him with whom it has not formerly been ? By this one word alone are the supporters of this one of the four opinions embarrassed. And yet I do not think that this opinion ought to be held as refuted by this one word, for it may be possible to show that in the ordinary style of scriptural language it may be quite correct to use the word "return," as signifying the spirit created by God returns to Him not because of its having been with Him before its union with the body, but because of its having received being from His creative power.<br>
    11. I have written these things in order to show that whoever is disposed to maintain and vindicate any one of these four theories of the soul's origin, must bring forward, either from the Scriptures received into ecclesiastical authority, passages which do not admit of any other interpretation,- as the statement that God made � man,- or reasonings founded on premises so obviously true that to call them in question would be madness, such as the statement that<br>
<br>
494<br>
<br>
none but the living are capable of knowledge or of error; for a statement like this does not require the authority of Scripture to prove its truth, as if the common sense of mankind did not of itself announce its truth with such transparent cogency of reason, that whoever contradicts it must be held to be hopelessly mad. If any one .is able to produce such arguments in discussing _the very obscure question of the soul's origin, let him help me in my ignorance; but if he cannot do this, let him forbear from blaming my hesitation on the question.<br>
    12. As to the virginity of the Holy Mary, if what I have written on this subject does not suffice to prove that it was possible, we must refuse to believe every record of anything miraculous having taken place in the body of any. If, .however, the objection to believing this miracle is, that it happened only once, ask the friend who is still perplexed by this, whether instances may not be quoted from secular literature of events which were, like this one, unique, and which, nevertheless, are believed, not merely as fables are believed by the simple, but with that faith with which the history of facts is received --ask him, I beseech you, this question. For if he says that nothing of this kind is to be found in these writings, he ought to have such instances pointed out to him; if he admits this, the question is decided by his admission.<br>

<br>
	TO MY HONOURABLE AND JUSTLY ESTEEMED LORDS, THE, INHABITANTS OF CIRTA, OF ALL RANKS, BRETHREN DEARLY BELOVED AND LONGED FOR, BISHOP AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    1. If that which greatly distressed me in your town has now been removed; if the obduracy of hearts which resisted most evident and, as we might call it, notorious truth, has by the force of truth been overcome; if the sweetness of peace is relished, and the love which tends to unity is the occasion no longer of pain to eyes diseased, but of light and vigour to eyes restored to health,--this is God's work, not ours; on no account would I ascribe these results to human efforts, even had such a remarkable conversion of your whole community taken place when I was with you, and in connection with my own preaching and exhortations. The operation and the success are His who, by His servants, calls men's attention outwardly by the signs of things, and Himself teaches men inwardly by the things themselves. The fact, however, that whatever praiseworthy change has been wrought among you is to be ascribed not to us, but to Him who alone doeth wonderful works? is no reason for our being more reluctant to be persuaded to visit you. For we ought to hasten much more readily to see the works of God than our own works, for we ourselves also, if we be of service in any work, owe this not to men but to Him; wherefore the apostle says, "Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase." 2<br>
    2. You allude in your letter to a fact which I also remember from classic literature, that by discoursing on the benefits of temperance, Xenocrates suddenly converted Polemo from a dissipated to a sober life, though this man was not only habitually intemperate, but was actually intoxicated at the time. Now although this was, as you have wisely and truthfully apprehended, a case not of conversion to God, but of emancipation from the thraldom of self-indulgence, I would not ascribe even the amount of improvement wrought in him to the work of man, but to the work of God. For even in the body, the lowest part of our nature, all excellent things, such as beauty, vigour, health, and so on, are the work of God, to whom nature owes its creation and perfection; how much more certain, therefore, must it be that no other can impart excellent properties to the soul! For what imagination of human folly could be more full of pride and ingratitude than the notion that, although God alone can give comeliness to the body, it belongs to man to give purity to the soul? It is written in the book of Christian Wisdom, "I perceived that no one can have self-restraint unless God give it to him, and that this is a part of true wisdom to know whose gift it is." 3 If, therefore, Polemo, when he exchanged a life of dissipation for a life of sobriety, had so understood whence the gift came, that, renouncing the superstitions of the heathen, he had rendered worship to the Divine Giver, he would then have become not only temperate, but truly wise and savingly religious, which would have secured to him not merely the practice of virtue in this life, but also the possession of immortality in the life to come. How much less, then, should I presume to take to myself the honour of your conversion, or of that of your people which you have now reported to me, which, when I was neither speaking to you nor even present with you, was accomplished unquestionably by divine power in all in whom it has really taken place. This, therefore, know above all things, meditate on this with devout humility. To God, my brethren, to God give thanks. Fear Him, that ye may not go backward: love Him, that ye may go forward.4<br>
<br>
495<br>
<br>
    3. If, however, love of men still keeps some secretly alienated from the flock of Christ, while fear of other men constrains them to a feigned reconciliation, I charge all such to consider that before God the conscience of man has no covering, and that they can neither impose on Him as a Witness, nor escape from Him as a Judge. But if, by reason of anxiety as to their own salvation, anything as to the question of the unity of Christ's flock perplex them, let them make this demand upon themselves,- and it seems to me a most just demand, --that in regard to the Catholic Church, i.e. the Church spread abroad over the whole world, they believe rather the words of Divine Scripture than the calumnies of human tongues. Moreover, with respect to the schism which has arisen among men (who assuredly, whatsoever they may be, do not frustrate the promises of God to Abraham, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,"1 -- promises believed when brought to their ears as a prophecy, but denied, forsooth, when set before their eyes as an accomplished fact), let them meanwhile ponder this one very brief, but, if I mistake not, unanswerable argument: the question out of which the dispute arose either has or has not been tried before ecclesiastical tribunals beyond the sea; if it has not been tried before these, then no guilt in this matter is chargeable on the whole flock of Christ in the nations beyond the sea, in communion with which we rejoice, and therefore their separation from these guiltless communities is an act of impious schism; if, on the other hand, the question has been tried before the tribunal of these churches, who does not understand and feel, nay, who does not see, that those whose communion is now separated from these churches were the party defeated in the trial ? Let them therefore choose to whom they should prefer to give credence, whether to the ecclesiastical judges who decided the question, or to the complaints of the vanquished litigants. Observe wisely how impossible it is for them reasonably to answer this brief and most intelligible dilemma; nevertheless, it were easier to turn Polemo from a life of intemperance, than to drive them out of the madness of inveterate error.<br>
    Pardon me, my noble and worthy lords, brethren most dearly beloved and longed for, for writing you a letter more prolix than agreeable, but fitted, as I think, to benefit rather than to flatter you. As to my coming to you, may God fulfil the desire which we both equally cherish ! For I cannot express in words, but I am sure you will gladly believe, with what fervour of love I burn to see you.&nbsp;<br>

                             (A.D. 412 or 413.)<br>
<br>
	TO ANASTASIUS, MY HOLY AND BELOVED LORD AND BROTHER, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. A most satisfactory opportunity of saluting your genuine worth is furnished by our brethren Lupicinus and Concordialis, honourable servants of God, from whom, even without my writing, you might learn all that is going on among us here. But knowing, as I do, how much you love us in Christ, because of your knowing how warmly your love is reciprocated by us in Him, I was sure that it might have disappointed you if you had seen them, and could not but know that they had come directly from us, and were most intimately united in friendship with us, and yet had received with them no letter from me. Besides this, I am owing you a reply, for I am not aware of having written to you since I received your last letter; so great are the cares by which I am encumbered and distracted, that know not whether I have written or not before now.<br>
    2. We desire eagerly to know how you are, and whether the Lord has given you some rest, so far as in this world He can bestow it; for "if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it;''2 and so it is almost always our experience, that when, in the midst of our anxieties, we turn our thoughts to some of our brethren placed in a condition of comparative rest, we are in no small measure revived, as if in them we ourselves enjoyed a more peaceful and tranquil life. At the same time, when vexatious cares are multiplied in this uncertain life, they compel us to long for the everlasting rest. For this world is more dangerous to us in pleasant than in painful hours, and is to be guarded against more when it allures us to love it than when it warns and constrains us to despise it. For although "all that is in the world" is "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,"3 nevertheless, even in the case of men who prefer to these the things which are spiritual, unseen, and eternal, the sweetness of earthly things insinuates itself into our affections, and accompanies our steps on the path of duty with its seductive allurements. For the violence with which present things acquire sway over our weakness is exactly proportioned to the superior value by which future things command our love. And oh that those who have learned to observe and bewail this may succeed in overcoming and escaping from this power of terrestrial things! Such victory and<br>
<br>
496<br>
<br>
emancipation cannot, without God's grace, be achieved by the human will, which is by no means to be called free so long as it is subject to prevailing and enslaving lusts; "For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."' And the Son of God has Himself said, "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."2<br>
    3. The law, therefore, by teaching and commanding what cannot be fulfilled without grace, demonstrates to man his weakness, in order that the weakness thus proved may resort to the Saviour, by whose healing the will may be able to do what in its feebleness it found impossible. So, then, the law brings us to faith, faith obtains the Spirit in fuller measure, the Spirit sheds love abroad in us, and love fulfils the law. For this reason the law is called a "schoolmaster," 3 under whose threatenings and severity "whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered." 4 But how shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?" s Wherefore unto them that believe and call on Him the quickening Spirit is given, lest the letter without the Spirit should kill them.6 But by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts? so that the words of the same apostle, "Love is the fulfilling of the law," s are realized. So the law is good to the man who uses it lawfully;9 and he uses it lawfully who, understanding wherefore it was given, betakes himself, under the pressure of its threatenings, to grace, which sets him free. Whoever unthankfully despises this grace, by which the ungodly are justified, and trusts in his own strength, as if he thereby could fulfil the law, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish his own righteousness, is not submitting himself to the righteousness of God; ,o and thus the law becomes to him not a help to pardon, but the bond fastening his guilt to him. Not that the law is evil, but because sin worketh death in such persons by that which is good.11 For by occasion of the commandment he sins more grievously who, by the commandment, knows how evil are the sins which he commits.<br>
    4. In vain, however, does any one think himself to have gained the victory over sin, if, through nothing but fear of punishment, he refrains from sin; because, although the outward action to which an evil desire prompts him is not performed, the evil desire itself within the man is an enemy unsubdued. And who is found innocent in God's sight who is willing to do the sin which is forbidden if you only remove the punishment which is feared ? And consequently, even in the volition itself, he is guilty of sin who wishes to do what is unlawful, but refrains from doing it because it cannot be done with impunity; for, so far as he is concerned, he would prefer that there were no righteousness forbidding and punishing sins. And assuredly, if he would prefer that there should be no righteousness, who can doubt that he would if he could abolish it altogether? How, then, can that man be called righteous who is such an enemy to righteousness that, if he had the power, he would abolish its authority, that he might not be subject to its threatenings or its penalties ? He, then, is an enemy to righteousness who refrains from sin only through fear of punishment; but he will become the friend of righteousness if through love of it he sin not, for then he will be really afraid to sin. For the man who only fears the flames of hell is afraid not of sinning, but of being burned; but the man who hates sin as much as he hates hell is afraid to sin. This is the "fear of the Lord," which "is pure, enduring for ever." ,2 For the fear of punishment has torment, and is not in love; and love, when it is perfect, casts it out. 13<br>
    5. Moreover, every one hates sin just in proportion as he loves righteousness; which he will be enabled to do not through the law putting him in fear by the letter of its prohibitions, but by the Spirit healing him by grace. Then that is done which the apostle enjoins in the admonition," I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness." ,4 For what is the force of the conjunctions "as" and "even so," if it be not this: "As no fear compelled you to sin, but the desire for it, and the pleasure taken in sin, even so let not the fear of punishment drive you to a life of righteousness; but let the pleasure found in righteousness and the love you bear to it draw you to practise it "? And even this is, as it seems to me, a righteousness, so to speak, somewhat mature, but not perfect. For he would not have prefaced the admonition with the words, "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh," had there not been something else that ought to have been said if they had been by that time able to bear it. For surely more devoted service is due to righteousness<br>
<br>
497<br>
<br>
than men are wont to yield to sin. For pain of body restrains men, if not from the desire of sin, at least from the commission of sinful actions; and we should not easily find any one who would openly commit a sin procuring to him an impure and unlawful gratification, if it was certain that the penalty of torture would immediately follow the crime. But righteousness ought to be so loved that not even bodily sufferings should hinder us from doing its works, but that, even when we are in the hands of cruel enemies, our good works should so shine before men that those who are capable of taking pleasure therein may glorify our Father who is in heaven.1<br>
    6. Hence it comes that that most devoted lover of righteousness exclaims," Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or<br>
nakedness, or peril, or sword ? (As it is written, For Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."2 Observe how he does not say simply, "Who shall separate us from Christ?" but, indicating that by which we cling to Christ, he says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ?" We cling to Christ, then, by love, not by fear of punishment. Again, after having enumerated those things which seem to be sufficiently fierce, but have not sufficient force to effect a separation, he has, in the conclusion, called that the love of God which he had previously spoken of as the love of Christ. And what is this "love of Christ" but love of righteousness? for it is said of Him that He "is made of God unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." 3 As, therefore he is superlatively wicked who is not deterred even by the penalty of bodily sufferings from the vile works of sordid pleasure, so is he superlatively righteous who is not restrained even by the fear of bodily sufferings from the holy works of most glorious love.<br>
    7. This love of God, which must be maintained by unremitting, devout meditation, "is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us," 4 so that he who glories in it must glory in the Lord. Forasmuch, therefore, as we feel ourselves to be poor and destitute of that love by which the law is most truly fulfilled, we ought not to expect and demand its riches from our own indigence, but to ask, seek, and knock in prayer, that He with whom is" the fountain of life" "may satisfy us abundantly with the fatness of His house, and make us drink of the river of His pleasures," 5 so that, watered and revived by its full flood, we may not only escape from being swallowed up by sorrow, but may even "glory in tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; "-- not that we can do this of ourselves, but "because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us." 6<br>
    8. It has been a pleasure to me to say, at least by a letter, these things which I could not say when you were present. I write them, not in reference to yourself, for you do not affect high things, but are contented with that which is lowly? but in reference to some who arrogate too much to the human will, imagining that, the law being given, the will is of its own strength sufficient to fulfil that law, though not assisted by any grace imparted by the Holy Spirit, in addition to instruction in the law; and by their reasonings they persuade the wretched and impoverished weakness of man to believe that it is not our duty to pray that we may not enter into temptation. Not that they dare openly to say this; but this is, whether they acknowledge it or not, an inevitable consequence of their doctrine.s For wherefore is it said to us, "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; "9 and wherefore was it that, when He was teaching us to pray, He prescribed, in accordance with this injunction, the use of the petition "lead us not into temptation," '� if this be wholly in the power of the will of man, an&amp; does not require the help of divine grace in. order to its accomplishment ?<br>
    Why should I say more ? Salute the brethren, who are with you, and pray for us, that we may be saved with that salvation of which it is said,. "They that are whole need not a physician, but: they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."" Pray, therefore, for us that we may be righteous,- an attainment wholly beyond a man's reach, unless he know righteousness and be willing to practise it, but one which is immediately realized when he is perfectly willing; but this full consent of his will can<br>
<br>
498<br>
<br>
never be in him unless he is healed and assisted by the grace of the Spirit.<br>

                       LETTER CXLVI. (A.D. 413.)<br>
<br>
	TO PELAGIUS, MY LORD GREATLY BELOVED, AND BROTHER GREATLY LONGED FOR, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I thank you very much for your consideration in making me glad by a letter from you, and informing me of your welfare. May the Lord recompense you with those blessings by the possession of which you may be good for ever, and may live eternally with Him who is eternal, my lord greatly beloved, and brother greatly longed for. Although I do not acknowledge that anything in me deserves tile eulogies which the letter of your Benevolence contains concerning me, nevertheless I cannot but be grateful for the goodwill therein manifested towards one so insignificant, while suggesting at the same time that you should rather pray for me that I may be made by the Lord such as you suppose me already to be.<br>
    (In another hand) May you enjoy safety and the Lord's favour, and be mindful of us ! '<br>
<br>
                      LETTER CXLVIII. (A.D. 413.)<br>
<br>
A LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS (COMMONITORIUM) TO THE HOLY BROTHER FORTUNATIANUS.2<br>
<br>
          CHAP. I. -- I. I write this to remind you of the '<br>
request which I made when I was with you, that you would do me the kindness of visiting our brother, whom we mentioned in conversation, in order to ask him to forgive me, if he has construed as a harsh and unfriendly attack upon himself any statement made by me in a recent letter (which I do not regret having written), affirming that the eyes of this body cannot see God, and never shall see Him. I added immediately the reason wily I made this statement. namely, to prevent men from believing that God Himself is corporeal and visible, as occupying a place determined by size and by distance from us (for the eye of this body can see nothing except under these conditions), and to prevent men from understanding the expression "face to face "3 as if God were limited within the members of a body. Therefore I do not regret having made this statement, as a protest against our forming such unworthy and profane ideas concerning God as to think that He is not everywhere in His totality, but susceptible of division, and distributed through localities in space; for such are the only objects cognizable through these eyes of ours.<br>
    2. But if, while holding no such opinion as this concerning God, but believing Him to be a Spirit, unchangeable, incorporeal, present in His whole Being everywhere, any one thinks that the change on this body of ours (when from being a natural body it shall become a spiritual body) will be so great that in such a body it will be possible for us to see a spiritual substance not susceptible of division according to local distance or dimension, or even confined within the<br>
limits of bodily members, but everywhere present in its totality, I wish him to instruct me in 'i this matter, if what he has discovered is true; but if in this opinion he is mistaken, it is far less objectionable to ascribe to the body something that does not belong to it, than to take away from God that which belongs to Him. And even if that opinion be correct, it will not contradict my words in that letter; for I said that the eyes of this body shall not see God, meaning that the eyes of this body of ours can see nothing but bodies which are separated from them by some interval of space, for if there be no interval, even bodies themselves cannot through the eyes be seen by us.<br>
 3. Moreover, if our bodies shall be changed into something so different from what they now are as to have eyes by means of which a substance shall be seen which is not diffused through space or confined within limits, having one part in one place, another in another, a smaller in a less space, a greater in a larger, but in its totality spiritually present everywhere,- these bodies shall be something very different from what they are at present, and shall no longer be themselves, and shall be not only freed from mortality, and corruption, and weight, but somehow or other shall be changed into the quality of the mind itself, if they shall be able to see in a manner which shall be then granted to the mind, but which is meanwhile' not granted even to the mind itself. For if, when a man's habits are changed, we say he is not the man he was, -- if, when our age is changed, we say that the body is not what it was, how much more may we say that the body shall not be the same when it shall have undergone so great a change as not only to have immortal life, but also to have power to see Him who is invisible ? Wherefore, if they shall thus see God, it is not with the eyes of this body that He shall be seen, because in this also it shall not be the same body, since it has been<br>
499<br>
<br>
changed to so great an extent in capacity and power; and this opinion is, therefore, not contrary to the words of my letter. If, however; the body shall be changed only to this extent, that whereas now it is mortal, then it shall be immortal, and whereas now it weighs down the soul, then, devoid of weight, it shall be most ready for every motion, but unchanged in the faculty of seeing objects which are discerned by their dimensions and distances, it will still be utterly impossible for it to see a substance that is incorporeal and is in its totality present everywhere. Whether, therefore, the former or the latter supposition be correct, in both cases it remains true that the eyes of this body shall not see God; or if they are to see Him, they shall not be the eyes of this body, since after so great a change they shall be the eyes of a body very different from this.<br>
    4. But if this brother is able to propound anything better on this subject, I am ready to learn either from himself or from his instructor. If I were saying this ironically, I would also say that I am prepared to learn concerning God that He has a body having members, and is divisible in different localities in space; which I do not say, because I am not speaking ironically, and I am perfectly certain that God is not in any respect of such a nature; and I wrote that letter to prevent men from believing Him to be such. In that letter, being carried away by my zeal to warn against error, and writing more freely because I did not name the person whose views I assailed, I was too vehement and not sufficiently guarded,and did not consider as I ought to have done the respect which was due by one brother and bishop to the office of another: this I do not defend, but blame; this I condemn rather than excuse, and beg that it may be forgiven. I entreat him to remember our old friendship, and forget my recent offence. Let him do that which he is displeased with me for not having done; let him exhibit in granting pardon the gentleness which I have failed to show in writing that letter. I thus ask, through your kindly mediation, what I had resolved to ask of him in person if I had had an opportunity. I indeed made an effort to obtain an interview with him (a venerable man, worthy of being honoured by us all, writing to request it in my name), but he declined to come, suspecting, I suppose, that, as very often happens among men, some plot was prepared against him. Of my absolute innocence of such guile, I beg you to do your utmost to assure him, which by seeing him personally you can more easily do. State to him with what deep and genuine grief I conversed with you about my having hurt his feelings. Let him know how far I am from slighting him, how much in him I fear God, and am mindful of our Head in whose body we are brethren. My reason for thinking it better not to go to the place in which he resides was, that we might not make ourselves a laughing-stock to those without the pale of the Church, thereby bringing grief to our friends and shame to ourselves. All this may be satisfactorily arranged through the good offices of your Holiness and Charity; nay, rather, the satisfactory issue is in the hands of Him who, by the faith which is His gift, dwells in your heart, whom I am confident that our brother does not refuse to honour in you, since he knows Christ experimentally as dwelling in himself.<br>
    5. I, at all events, do not know what I could do better in this case than ask pardon from the brother who has complained that he was wounded by the harshness of my letter. He will, I hope, do what he knows to be enjoined on him by Him who, speaking through the apostle, says: "Forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as God in Christ has forgiven you;"1 "Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us." 2 Walking in this love, let us inquire with oneness of heart, and, if possible, with yet greater diligence than hitherto, into the nature of the spiritual body which we shall have after our resurrection. "And if in anything we be diversely minded, God shall reveal even this unto us," 3 if we abide in Him. Now he who dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, for "God is love," 4 --whether as the fountain of love in its ineffable essence, or as the fountain whence He freely gives it to us by His Spirit. If, then, it can be shown that love can at any time become visible to our bodily eyes, then we grant that possibly God shall be so too; but if love never can become visible, much less can He who is Himself its Fountain or whatever other figurative name more excellent or more appropriate can be employed in speaking of One so great.<br>
    CHAP. II.- 6. Some men of great gifts, and very learned in the Holy Scriptures, who have, when an opportunity presented itself, done much by their writings to benefit the Church and promote the instruction of believers, have said that the invisible God is seen in an invisible manner, that is, by that nature which in us also is invisible, namely, a pure mind or heart. The holy Ambrose, when speaking of Christ as the Word, says: "Jesus is seen not by the bodily, but by the spiritual eyes;" and shortly after he adds: "The Jews saw Him not, for their foolish heart was blinded," s showing in this way how Christ is seen. Also, when he was speaking of the<br>
<br>
500<br>
<br>
Holy Spirit, he introduced the words of the Lord, saying: "I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him;" ' and adds: "With good reason, therefore, did He show Himself in the body, since in the substance of His Godhead He is not seen. We have seen the Spirit, but in a bodily form: let us see the Father also; but since we cannot see Him, let us hear Him." A little after he says: "Let us hear the Father, then, for the Father is invisible; but the Son also is invisible as regards His Godhead, for ' no man hath seen God at any time; ' 2 and since the Son is God, He is certainly not seen in that in which He is God." 3<br>
    7. The holy Jerome also says: "The eye of man cannot see God as He is in His own nature; and this is true not of man only; neither angels, nor thrones, nor powers, nor principalities, nor any name which is named can see God, for no creature can see its Creator." By these words this very learned man sufficiently shows what his opinion was on this subject in regard not only to the present life, but also to that which is to come. For however much the eyes of our body may be changed for the better, they shall only be made equal to the eyes of the angels. Here, however, Jerome has affirmed that the nature of the Creator is invisible even to the angels, and to every creature without exception in heaven. If, however, a question arise on this point, and a doubt is expressed whether we shall not be superior to the angels, the mind of the Lord Himself is plain from the words which He uses in speaking of those who shall rise again to the kingdom: "They shall be equal unto the angels." 4 Whence the same holy Jerome thus expresses himself in another passage: "Man, therefore, cannot see the face of God but the angels of the least in the Church do always behold the face of God.s And now we see as in a mirror darkly, in a riddle, but then face to face;6 when from being men we shall advance to the rank of angels, and shall be able to say with the apostle, 'We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord; ' 7 although no creature can see the face of God, according to the essential properties of His nature, and He is, in these cases, seen by the mind, since He is believed to be invisible."8     8. In these words of this man of God there are many things deserving our consideration: first, that in accordance with the very clear declaration of the Lord, he also is of opinion that we shall then see the face of God when we shall have advanced to the rank of angels, that ,is, shall be made equal to the angels, which doubtless shall be at the resurrection of the dead. Next, he has sufficiently explained by the testimony of the apostle, that the face is to be understood not of the outward but of the inward man, when it is said we shall "see face to face;" for the apostle was speaking of the face of the heart when he used the words quoted in this connection by Jerome: "We, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image." 9 If any one doubt this, let him examine the passage again, and notice of what the apostle was speaking, namely, of the veil, which remains on the heart of every one in reading the Old Testament, until he pass over to Christ, that the veil may be removed. For he there says: "We also, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord,'' m which face had not been unveiled in the Jews, of whom he says, "the veil is upon their heart," --in order to show that the face unveiled in us when the veil is taken away is the face of the heart. In fine, lest any one, looking on these things with too little care and therefore failing to discern their meaning, should believe that God now is or shall hereafter be visible either to angels or to men, when they shall have been made equal to the angels, he has most plainly expressed his opinion by affirming that "no creature can see the face of God according to the essential properties of His nature," and that "He is, in these cases, seen by the mind, since He is believed to be invisible." From these statements he sufficiently showed that when God has been seen by men through the eyes of the body as if He had a body, He has not been seen as to the essential properties of his nature, in which He is seen by the mind, since He is believed to be invisible-invisible, that is to say, to the bodily perception even of celestial beings, as Jerome had said above, of angels, and powers, and principalities. How much more, then, is 'He invisible to terrestrial beings !<br>
    9. Wherefore, in another place, Jerome says in i still plainer terms, it is true not only of the divinity of the Father but equally of that of the Son md of that of the Holy Spirit, forming one nature in the Trinity, that it cannot be seen by the eyes of the flesh, but by the eyes of the mind, of which the Saviour Himself says: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." 10<br>
<br>
501<br>
<br>
What could be more clear than this statement ? For if he had merely said that it is impossible for the divinity of the Father, or of the Son, or of the Holy Spirit, to be seen by the eyes of the flesh, and had not added the words, "but only by the eyes of the mind," it might perhaps have been said, that when the body shall have become spiritual it can no longer be called "flesh;" but by adding the words, "but only by the eyes of the mind," he has excluded the vision of God from every sort of body. Lest, however, any one should suppose that he was speaking only of the present state of being, observe that he has subjoined also a testimony of the Lord, quoted with the design of defining the eyes of the mind of which he had spoken; in which testimony a promise is given not of present, but of future vision: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."<br>
    10. The very blessed Athanasius, also, Bishop of Alexandria, when contending against tile Arians, who affirm that the Father alone is invisible, but suppose the Son and the Holy Spirit to be visible, asserted the equal invisibility of all the Persons of the Trinity, proving it by testimonies from Holy Scripture, and arguing with all his wonted care in controversy, labouring earnestly to convince his opponents that God has never been seen, except through His assuming the form of a creature; and that in His essential Deity God is invisible, that is, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are invisible, except in so far as the Divine Persons can be known by the mind and the spirit. Gregory, also, a holy Eastern bishop, very plainly says that God, by nature invisible, had, on those occasions on which He was seen by the fathers (as by Moses, with whom He talked face to face), made it possible for Himself to be seen by assuming the form of something material and discernible.' Our Ambrose says the same: "That the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, when visible, are seen under forms assumed by choice, not prescribed by the nature of Deity; ": thus clearing the truth of the saying, "No man hath seen God at any time," s which is the word of the Lord Christ Himself, and of that other saying, "Whom no man hath seen, nor can see," 4 which is the word of the apostle, yea, rather, of Christ by His apostle; as well as! vindicating the consistency of those passages of' Scripture in which God is related to have been seen, because He is both invisible in the essential nature of His Deity, and able to become visible when He pleases, by assuming such created form as shall seem good to Him.<br>
    CHAP. III. II. Moreover, if invisibility is a property of the divine nature, as incorruptibility is, that nature shall assuredly not undergo such a change in the future world as to cease to be invisible and become visible; because it shall never be possible for it to cease to be incorruptible and become corruptible, for it is in both attributes alike immutable. The apostle assuredly declared the excellence of the divine nature when he placed these two together, saying, "Now, unto the King of ages, invisible, incorruptible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever." s Wherefore I dare not make such a distinction as to say incorruptible, indeed, for ever and ever, but invisible- not for ever and ever, but only in this world. At the same time, since the testimonies which we are next to quote cannot be false,-" Blessed are the pure m heart, for they shall see God,"6 and, "We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him � for we shall see Him as He is "7 --we cannot deny that the sons of God shall see God; but they shall see Him as invisible things are seen, in the manner in which He who appeared in the flesh, visible to men, promised that He would manifest Himself to men, when, speaking in tile presence of the disciples and seen by their eyes, He said: "I will love him, and will manifest myself to him." In what other manner are invisible things seen than by the eyes of the mind, concerning which, as the instruments of our vision of God, I have shortly before quoted the opinion of Jerome ?<br>
     12. Hence, also, the statement of the Bishop of Milan, whom I have quoted before, who says that even in the resurrection it is not easy for any but those who have a pure heart to see God, and therefore it is written, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." "How many," he says, "had He already enumerated as blessed, and yet to them He had not promised the power of seeing God;" and he adds this inference, "If, therefore, the pure in heart shall see God, it is obvious that others shall not see Him;" and to prevent our understanding him to refer to those others of whom the Lord had said, "Blessed are the poor, blessed are the meek," he immediately subjoined, "For those that are unworthy shall not see God," intending it to be understood that the unworthy are those who, although they shall rise again, shall not be able to see God, since they shall rise to condemnation, because they refused to purify their hearts through that true faith which "worketh by love."s For this reason he goes on to say,<br>
<br>
502<br>
<br>
"Whosoever has been unwilling to see God cannot see Him." Then, since it occurred to him that, in a sense, even all wicked men have a desire to see God, he immediately explains that he used the words, "Whosoever has been unwilling to see God," because the fact that the wicked do not desire to purify the heart, by which alone God can be seen, shows that they do not desire to see God, and follows up this statement with the words: "God is not seen in space, but in the pure heart; nor is He sought out by the eyes of the body; nor is He defined in form by our faculty of sight; nor grasped by the touch; His voice does not fall on the ear; nor are His goings perceived by the senses."1 By these words the blessed Ambrose desired to teach the preparation which men ought to make if they wish to see God, viz. to purify the heart by the faith which worketh by love, through the gift of the Holy Spirit, from whom we have received the earnest by which we are taught to desire that vision.2<br>
    CHAP. IV. -- 13. For as to the members of God which the Scripture frequently mentions, lest any one should suppose that we resemble God as to the form and figure of the body, the same] Scripture speaks of God as having also wings, ] which we certainly have not. As then, when we hear of the "wings" of God, we understand the divine protection, so by the "hands" of God we ought to understand His working, -- by His "feet," His. presence, --.by His "eyes," His power of seeing and knowing all things, -- by His face, that whereby He reveals Himself to our knowledge; and I believe that any other such expression used in Scripture is to be spiritually understood. In this opinion I am not singular, nor am I the first who has stated it, It is the opinion of all who by any spiritual interpretation of such language in Scripture resist those who are called Anthropomorphites. Not to occupy too much time by quoting largely from the writings of these men, I introduce here one extract from the pious Jerome, in order that our brother may know that, if anything moves him to maintain an opposite opinion, he is bound to carry on the debate with those who preceded me not less than with myself.<br>
    14. In the exposition which that most learned student of Scripture has given of the psalm in which occur the words, "Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise ? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? or He that formed the eye, doth He not behold ?" 3 he says, among other things: "This passage furnishes a strong argument against those who are Anthropomorphites, and say that God has members such as we have. For example, God is said by them to have eyes, because ' the eyes of the Lord behold all things :' in the same , literal manner they take the statements that the i hand of the Lord doeth all things, and that n Adam ' heard the sound of the feet of the Lord walking in the garden,' and thus they ascribe the ' infirmities of men to the majesty of God. But I affirm that God is all eye, all hand, all foot: alI eye, because He sees all things; all hand, because He worketh all things; all foot, because He is everywhere present. See, therefore, what the Psalmist saith: ' He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, doth He not behold ?' He doth not say: ' He that planted the ear, has He not an ear? and He that formed the eye, has He not an eye ?' But what does he say? ' He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, doth He not behold ?' The Psalmist has ascribed to God the powers of seeing and hearing, but has not assigned members to Him." 4<br>
    15. I have thought it my duty to quote all these passages from the writings of both Latin and Greek authors who, being in the Catholic Church before our time, have written commentaries on the divine oracles, in order that our brother, if he hold any different opinion from theirs, may know that it becomes him, laying aside all bitterness of controversy, and preserving or reviving fully the gentleness of brotherly love, to investigate with diligent and calm consideration either what he must learn from others, or what others must learn from him. For the reasonings of any men whatsoever, even though they be Catholics, and of high reputation, are not to be treated by us in the same way as the canonical Scriptures are treated. We are at liberty, without doing any violence to the respect which these men deserve, to condemn and reject anything in their writings, if perchance we shall find that they have entertained opinions differing from that which others or we ourselves have, by the divine help, discovered to be the truth. I deal thus with the writings of others, and I wish my intelligent readers to deal thus with mine. In fine, I do by the help of the Lord most stedfastly believe, and, in so far as He enables me, I understand what is taught in all the statements which I have now quoted from the works of the holy and learned Ambrose, Jerome, Athanasius, Gregory, and in any other similar statements in other writers which I have read, but have for the sake of brevity forborne from quoting, namely, that God is not a body, that He has not the members of the human frame, that He is not divisible through space, and that He is unchangeably invisible, and appeared not in His essential nature and substance,<br>
<br>
503<br>
<br>
but in such visible form as He pleased to those to whom he appeared on the occasions on which Scripture records that He was seen by holy persons with the eyes of the body.<br>
    CHAP. V. -- 16. As to the spiritual body which we shall have in the resurrection, how great a change for the better it is to undergo, -- whether it shall become pure spirit, so that the whole man shall then be a spirit, or shall (as I rather think, but do not yet confidently maintain) become a spiritual body in such a way as to be called spiritual because of a certain ineffable facility in its movements, but at the same time to retain its material substance, which cannot live and feel by itself, but only through the spirit which uses it (for in our present state, in like manner, although the body is spoken of as animated [animal], the nature of the animating principle is different from that of the body),and whether, if the properties of the body then immortal and incorruptible shall remain unchanged, it shall then in some degree aid the spirit to see visible, i,e. material things, as at present we are unable to see anything of that kind except through the eyes of the body, or our spirit shall then be able, even in its higher state, to know material things without the instrumentality of the body (for God Himself does not know these things through bodily senses),on these and on many other things which may perplex us in the discussion of this subject, I confess that I have not yet read anywhere anything which I would esteem sufficiently established to deserve to be either learned or taught by men.<br>
    17. And for this reason, if our brother will J bear patiently any degree whatever of hesitation I on my part, let us in the meantime, because of] that which is written, "We shall see Him as, He is," prepare, so far as with the help of God, Himself we are enabled, hearts purified for that vision. Let us at the same time inquire more calmly and carefully concerning the spiritual body, for it may be that God, if He know this to be useful to us, may condescend to show us some definite and clear view on the subject, in accordance with His written word. For if a more careful investigation shall result in the discovery that the change on the body shall be so great that it shall be able to see things that are invisible, such power imparted to the body will not, I think, deprive the mind of the power of seeing, and thus give the outward man a vision of God which is denied to the inward man; as if, in contradiction of the plain words of' Scripture, "that God may be all and in all,"' God were only beside the man --without him, and not in the man, in his inner being; or as if He, who is everywhere present in his entirety, unlimited in space, is so within man that He can be seen outside only by the outward man, but cannot be seen inside by the inward man. If such opinions are palpably absurd,- for, on the contrary, the saints shall be full of God; they shall not, remaining empty within, be surrounded outside by Him; nor shall they, through being blind within, fail to see Him of whom they are full, and, having eyes only for that which is outside of themselves, behold Him by whom they shall be surrounded,--if, I say, these things are absurd, it remains for us to rest meanwhile certainly assured as to the vision of God by the inward man. But if, by some wondrous change, the. body shall be endowed with this power, another new faculty shall be added; the faculty formerly possessed shall not be taken away.<br>
    18. It is better, then, that we affirm that concerning which we have no doubt,--that God shall be seen by the inward man, which alone is able, in our present state, to see that love in commendation of which the apostle says, "God is love ;" 2 the inward man, which alone is able to see "peace and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord."3 For no fleshly eye now sees love, peace, and holiness, and such things; yet all of them are seen, so far as they can be seen, by the eye of the mind, and the purer it is the more clearly it sees; so that we may, without hesitation, believe that we shall see God, whether we succeed or fail in our investigations as to the nature of our future body--although, at the same time, we hold it to be certain that the body shall rise again, immortal and incorruptible, because on this we have the plainest and strongest testimony of Holy Scripture: If, however, our brother affirm now that he has arrived at certain knowledge as to that spiritual body, in regard to which I am only inquiring, he will have just cause to be displeased with me if I shall refuse to listen calmly to his instructions, provided only that he also listen calmly to my questions. Now, however, I entreat you, for Christ's sake, to obtain his forgiveness for me for that harshness in my letter, by which, as I have learned, he was, not without cause, offended; and may you, by God's help, cheer my spirit by your answer.<br>

                        LETTER CL. (A.D. 413.)<br>
	TO PROBA4 AND JULIANA, LADLES MOST WORTHY OF HONOUR, DAUGHTERS JUSTLY FAMOUS AND MOST DISTINGUISHED, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    You have filled our heart with a joy singularly pleasant, because of the love we bear to you, and<br>
<br>
504<br>
<br>
singularly acceptable, because of the promptitude with which the tidings came to us. For while the consecration of the daughter of your house to a life of virginity is being published by most busy fame in all places where you are known, and that is everywhere, you have outstripped its flight by more sure and reliable information in a letter from yourselves, and have made us rejoice' in certain knowledge before we had time to be questioning the truth of any report concerning an event so blessed and remarkable. Who can declare in words, or expound with adequate praises, how incomparably greater is the glory and advantage gained by your family in giving to Christ women consecrated to His service, than in giving to the world men called to the honours of the consulship? For if it be a great and noble thing to leave the mark of an honoured name upon the revolving ages of this world, how much greater and nobler is it to rise above it by unsullied chastity both of heart and of body! Let this maiden, therefore, illustrious in her pedigree, yet more illustrious in her piety, find greater joy in obtaining, through espousals to her divine Lord, a pre-eminent glory in heaven, than she could have had in becoming, through espousal to a human consort, the mother of a line of illustrious men. This daughter of the house of Anicius has acted the more magnanimous part, in choosing rather to bring a blessing on that noble family by forbearing from marriage, than to increase the number of its descendants, preferring to be already, in the purity of her body, I like unto the angels, rather than to increase by the fruit of her body the number of mortals. For this is a richer and more fruitful condition of blessedness, not to have a pregnant womb' but to develop the soul's lofty capacities; not to have the breasts flowing with milk, but to have the heart pure as snow; to travail not with the earthly in the pangs of labour, but with the heavenly in persevering prayer. May it be yours, my daughters, most worthy of the honour due to your rank, to enjoy in her that which was lacking to yourselves; may she be stedfast to the end, abiding in the conjugal union that has no end. May many handmaidens follow the example of their mistress; may those who are of humble rank imitate this high-born lady, and may those who possess eminence in this uncertain world aspire to that worthier eminence which humility has given to her. Let the virgins who covet the glory of the Anician family be ambitious rather to emulate its piety; for the former lies beyond their reach, however eagerly they may desire it, but the latter shall be at once in their possession if they seek it with full desire. May the right hand of the Most High protect you, giving you safety and greater happiness, ladies most worthy of honour, and most excellent daughters! In the love of the Lord, and with all becoming respect, we salute the children of your Holiness, and above all the one who is above the rest in holiness. We have received with very great pleasure the gift sent as a souvenir of her taking the veil.'<br>
<br>
                              LETTER CLI<br>
                          (A.D. 413 OR 414.)<br>
	TO CAECILIANUS,2 MY LORD JUSTLY RENOWNED, AND SON MOST WORTHY OF THE HONOUR DUE BY ME TO HIS RANK, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. The remonstrance which you have addressed to me in your letter is gratifying to me m proportion to the love which it manifests. If, therefore, ! attempt to clear myself from blame in regard to my silence, the thing which I must attempt is to show that you had no just cause for being displeased with me. But since nothing gives me greater pleasure than that you condescended to take offence at my silence, which I had supposed to be a matter of no moment in the midst of your many cares, I will be pleading against myself if I endeavour thus to clear myself from blame. For if you were wrong in being displeased at me for not writing to you, this must be because of your having such a poor opinion of me that you are absolutely indifferent whether I speak or remain silent. Nay, the displeasure which arises from your being distressed by my silence is not displeasure. I .therefore feel not so much grief at my withhold-rag, as joy at your desiring a communication from me. For it is an honour, not a vexation, to me, that I should have a place in the remembrance of an old friend, and a man who is (though you may not say it, yet it is our duty to acknowledge it) of such eminent worth and greatness, holding a position in a foreign country, and burdened with public responsibilities. Pardon me, then, for expressing my gratitude that you did not regard me as a person whose silence it was beneath you to resent. For now 12 am persuaded, through that benevolence which distinguishes you more even than your high rank, that in the midst of your numerous and important occupations, not of a private nature, but public, involving the interests of all, a letter from me may be esteemed by you not burdensome, but welcome.<br>
    2. For when I had received the letter of the holy father Innocentius, venerable for his eminent merits, which was sent to me by the brethren, and which was, by manifest tokens, shown to have been forwarded to me from your Excel-<br>
<br>
505<br>
<br>
lency, I formed the opinion that the reason why no letter from you accompanied it was that, being engrossed with more important affairs, you were unwilling to be embarrassed by the trouble of correspondence. For it seemed certainly not unreasonable to expect, that when you con-descended to send me the writings of a holy man, I should receive along with them some writings of your own. I had therefore made up my mind not to trouble you with a letter from me unless it was necessary for the purpose of commending to you some one to whom I could not refuse the service of my intercession, a favour which it is our custom to grant to all, -- a custom which, though involving much trouble, is not to be altogether condemned. I accordingly did this recommending to your kindness a friend of mine, from whom I have now received a letter, expressing his thanks, to which I add my own, for your service.<br>
    3. If, however, I had formed any unfavourable impression concerning yon, especially in regard to the matter of which, though it was not expressly named, a subtle odour, so to speak, pervaded your whole letter, far would it have been from me to write to you any such note in order to ask any favour for myself or another. In that case I would either have been silent, waiting for a time when I would have an opportunity of seeing you personally; or if I considered it my duty to write on the subject, I would have given it the first place in my letter, and would have treated it in such a way as to make it almost impossible for you to show displeasure. For when, notwithstanding remonstrances which, under an anxiety shared by you with us, we addressed to him,- beseeching him vehemently, but in vain, to forbear from piercing our hearts with so great sorrow, and mortally wounding his own conscience by such grievous sin, -- he ' perpetrated his impious, savage, and perfidious crime, I left Carthage immediately and secretly, for this reason, lest the numerous and influential persons who in terror sought refuge from his sword within the church should, imagining that my presence could be of use to them, detain me by their passionate weeping and groaning, so that I would be compelled, in order to secure the preservation of their bodies, to supplicate a favour from one whom it was impossible for me to rebuke in order to the welfare of his soul, with the severity which his crime deserved. As for their personal safety, I knew that the walls of the church sufficed for their protection. But for myself [if I remained to intercede with him on their behalf], it could only be in circumstances painfully embarrassing, for he would not have tolerated my acting towards him as I was bound to do, and I would have been compelled, moreover, to act in a way which would have been unbecoming in me. At the same time, I was truly sorry for the misfortune of my venerable co-bishop, the ruler of such an important church, who was expected to regard it as his duty, even after this man had been guilty of such infamous treachery, to treat him with submissive deference, in order that the lives of others might be spared. I confess the reason of my departure: it was that I would have been unable to meet with the necessary fortitude so great a calamity.<br>
    4. The same considerations which made me then depart would have been the cause of my remaining silent to you, if I believed you to have used your influence with him to avenge such wicked injuries. This is believed in regard to you only by those who do not know how, and how frequently, and in what terms, you expressed J your mind to us, when we were with anxious solicitude doing our utmost to secure that, because i he was so intimate with you, and you were so !constantly visiting him, and so often conversing 'alone with him, he should all the more carefully guard your good name, and save you from being supposed to have used no endeavour to prevent him from inflicting that mode of death on persons said to be your enemies. This, indeed, is not believed of you by me, nor by my brethren who heard you in conversation, and who saw, both in your words and in every gesture, the evidences of your heart's good-will to those who were put to death. But, I beseech you, forgive those by whom it is believed; for they are men, and in the minds of men there are such lurking places and such depths that, although all suspicious persons deserved to be blamed, they think themselves that they even deserve praise for their prudence. There existed reasons for the conduct imputed to you: we knew that you had suffered very grievous injury from one of those whom he had suddenly ordered to be arrested. His brother, also, in whose person especially he persecuted the Church, was said to have answered you in terms implying as it were some harsh accusation. Both were thought to be looked upon by you with suspicion. When they, after being summoned, had gone away, you still remained in the place, and were engaged, it was<br>
<br>
506<br>
<br>
said, in conversation of a more private kind than usual with him [Marinas], and then they were suddenly ordered to be detained. Men talked much of your friendship with him as not recent, but of long standing. The closeness of your intimacy, and the frequency of your private conversations with him, confirmed this report. His power was at that time great. The ease with which false accusations could be made against any one was notorious. It was not a difficult thing to find some person who would upon the promise of his own safety make any statements which he might order to be made. All things at that time made it easy for any man to be brought to death without any examination on the part of him who ordered the execution, if even one witness brought forward what seemed to be an odious and, at the same time, credible accusation.<br>
    5. Meanwhile, as it was rumored that the power of the Church might deliver them, we were mocked with false promises, so that not only with the consent, but, as it seemed, at the urgent desire of Marinus, a bishop was sent to the Imperial Court to intercede for them, the promise having been brought to the ear of the bishops that, until some pleading should be heard there on behalf of the prisoners, no examination of their case would be proceeded with. At last, on the day before they were put to death, your Excellency came to us; you gave us encouragement such as you had never before given, that he might grant their lives as a favour to you before your departure [for Rome], because you had solemnly and prudently said to him that all his condescension in admitting you so constantly to familiar and private conversation would bring to you disgrace rather than distinction, and would have the effect, after the death of these men had been a subject of conversation and! consultation between you, of making every one i say that there could be no doubt what was to be the issue of these conferences. When you informed us that you had said these things to him,. you stretched out your hand as you spoke i towards the place at which the sacraments of believers are celebrated, and while we listened in amazement, you confirmed the statement that you had used these words with an oath so solemn, that not only then, but even now after the dreadful and unexpected death of the prisoners, it seems to me, recalling to memory your whole demeanour, that it would be an aggravated insult if I were to believe any evil concerning you. You said, moreover, that he was so moved by these words of yours, that he purposed to give the lives of these men to you as a present, in token of friendship, before you set out on your journey.<br>
             6. Wherefore, I solemnly assure your Grace, that when on the following day (the day on which the infamous crime thus conceived was consummated) tidings were unexpectedly brought to us that they had been led forth from prison to stand before him as their judge, although we were in some alarm, nevertheless, after reflecting on what you had said to us on the preceding day, and on the fact that the day following was the anniversary of the blessed Cyprian, I supposed that he had even purposely selected a day on which he might not only grant your request, but also might aspire, by giving sudden joy to the whole Church of Christ, to emulate the virtue of so great a martyr, proving himself truly greater in using clemency in sparing life than in possessing power to inflict death. Such were my thoughts, when lo! a messenger burst into our presence, from whom, before we could ask him how their trial was being conducted, we learned that they had been beheaded. For care had been taken to arrange, as the scene of execution, a place immediately adjoining, not appointed for the punishment of criminals, but used for the recreation of the citizens, on which spot he had ordered some to be executed a few days previously, with the design (as is with good reason believed) of avoiding the odium of applying it to this purpose for the first time in the case of these men, whom he hoped to be able to snatch secretly from the Church interposing on their behalf, by thus not only ordering their immediate execution, but also ordering it to take place on the nearest available spot. He therefore made it sufficiently manifest that he did not fear to cause cruel pain to that Mother whose intervention he feared, namely, to the holy Church, among whose faithful children, baptized in her bosom, we knew that he himself was reckoned. Therefore, after the issue of so great a plot, in which so much care had been used in negotiating with us that we were made, even by you also, though unwittingly, almost free from solicitude, and almost sure of their safety on the preceding day, who, judging of the circumstances in the way in which ordinary men would judge of them, could avoid regarding it as beyond question that by you also words were given to us and life taken from them ? Pardon, then, as I have said, those who believe these things against you, although we do not believe them, O excellent man.<br>
    7. Far be it, however, from my heart and from my practice, however defective in many things, to intercede with you for any one, or ask a favour from you for any one, if I believed you to be responsible for this monstrous wrong, this villanous cruelty. But I frankly confess to you, that if you continue, even after that event, to be on the same footing of intimate friendship with him as you were formerly, you must excuse my claiming freedom to be grieved; for by this you would<br>
<br>
507<br>
<br>
compel us to believe much which we would rather disbelieve. It is, however, fitting that, as I do not believe you guilty of the other things laid by some to your charge, I should not believe this either. This friend of yours has, in the unexpected triumph of sudden accession to power, done violence not less to your reputation than to these men's lives. Nor is it my design in this statement to kindle hatred in your mind; in so doing I would belie my own feelings and profession. But I exhort you to a more faithful exercise of love towards him. For the man who so deals with the wicked as to make them repent of their evil doings, is one who knows how to be angry with them, and yet consult for their good; for as bad companions hinder men's welfare by compliance, so good friends help them by opposition to their evil ways. The same weapon with which, in the proud abuse of power, he took away the lives of others, inflicted a much deeper and more serious wound on his own soul i and if he do not remedy this by repentance, using wisely the long-suffering of God, he will be compelled to find it out and feel it when this life is ended. Often, moreover, God in His wisdom permits the life of good men in this world to be taken from them by the wicked, that He may prevent men from believing that to suffer such things is in their case a calamity. For what harm can result from the death of the body to men who are destined to die some time ? Or what do those who fear death accomplish by their care but a short postponement of the time at which they die ? All the evil to which mortal men are liable comes not from death but from life; and if in dying they have the soul sustained by Christian grace, death is to them not the night of darkness in which a good life ends, but the dawn in which a better life begins.1<br>
    8. The life and conversation of the eider of the two brothers appeared indeed more conformed to this world than to Christ, although he also had after his marriage corrected to a great extent the faults of his early irreligious years. It may, nevertheless, have been not otherwise than in mercy that our merciful God appointed him to be the companion of his brother in death. But as to that younger brother, he lived religiously, and was eminent as a Christian both in heart and in practice. The report that he would approve himself such when commissioned to serve the Church2  came before him to Africa, and this good report followed him still when he had come. In his conduct, what innocence! in his friendship, what constancy! in his study of Christian truth, what zeal! in his religion, what sincerity ! in his domestic life, what purity ! in his official duties, what integrity ! What patience be showed to enemies, what affability to friends, what humility to the pious, what charity to all men! How great his promptitude in granting, and his bashfulness in asking a favour ! HoW genuine his satisfaction in the good deeds, and his sorrow over the faults of men! What spotless honour, noble grace, and scrupulous piety shone in him! In rendering assistance, how compassionate he was ! in forgiving injuries, how generous ! in prayer, how confiding ! When well informed on any subject, with what modesty he was wont to communicate useful knowledge ! when conscious of ignorance, with what diligence did he endeavour by investigation to overcome the disadvantage ! How singular was his contempt for the things of time! how ardent his hope and his desires in regard to the blessings that are eternal! He would have relinquished all secular business and girded himself with the insignia of the Christian warfare, had he not been prevented by his having entered into the married state; for he had not begun to desire better things before the time when, being already involved in these bonds, it would have been, notwithstanding their inferiority, an unlawful thing for him to rend them asunder.<br>
    9. One day when they were confined in prison together, his brother said to him: "If I suffer these things as the just punishment of my sins, what ill desert has brought you to the same fate, for we know that your life was most strictly and earnestly Christian ?" He replied: "Supposing even that your testimony as to my life were true, do you think that God is bestowing a small fa-your upon me in appointing that my sins be punished in these sufferings, even though they should end in death, instead of being reserved to meet me in the judgment which is to come?" These words might perhaps lead some to suppose that he was conscious of some secret immoralities. I shall therefore mention what it pleased the Lord God to appoint that I should hear from his lips, and know assuredly, to my own great consolation. Being anxious about this very thing, as human nature is liable to fall into such wickedness, I asked him, when I was alone with him after he was confined in prison, if there was no sin for which he ought to seek reconciliation with God 3 by some more severe and special penance. With characteristic modesty he blushed at the mere mention of my suspicion, groundless though it was, but thanked me most warmly for the warning, and with a grave, modest smile he seized with both hands my right hand, and said: "I swear by the sacraments which are dispensed to me by this hand, that I have neither before<br>
<br>
508<br>
<br>
nor since my marriage been guilty of immoral self-indulgence.",<br>
    10. What evil, then, was brought to him by death ? Nay, rather, was it not the occasion of the greatest possible good to him, because, in the possession of these gifts, he departed from this life to Christ, in whom alone they are really possessed? I would not mention these things in addressing you if I believed that you would be offended by my praising him. But assuredly, as I do not believe this, neither do I believe that his being put to death was even according to your desire or wish, much less that it was done at your request. You, therefore, with a sincerity proportioned to your innocence in this matter, entertain, doubtless, along with us, the opinion that the man who put him to death inflicted more cruel wrong on his own soul than on the sufferer's body, when, in despite of us, in despite of his own promises, in despite of so many supplications and warnings from you, and finally, in despite of the Church of Christ (and in her of Christ Himself), he consummated his base machinations by putting this man to death. Is the high position of the one worthy to be compared with the lot of the other, prisoner though he was, when the man of power was maddened by anger, while the sufferer in his prison was filled with joy? There is nothing in all the dungeons of this world, nay, not even in hell itself, to surpass the dreadful doom of darkness to which a villian is consigned by remorse of conscience. Even to yourself, what evil did he do ? He did not destroy your innocence, although he grievously injured your reputation; which, nevertheless, remains uninjured, both in the estimation of those who know you better than we do, and in our estimation, in whose presence the anxiety which, like us, you felt for the prevention of such a monstrous crime, was expressed with so much visible agitation that we could almost see  with our eyes the invisible workings of your heart. Whatever harm, therefore, he has done, he has: done to himself alone; he has pierced through his own soul, his own life, his own conscience ;] in fine, he has by that blind deed of cruelty destroyed even his own good name, a thing which the very worst of men are usually fain to preserve. For to all good men he is odious in proportion to his efforts to obtain, or his satisfaction in receiving, the approbation of the wicked.<br>
    II. Could anything prove more clearly that he was not under the necessity which he pretended- alleging that he did this evil action as a good man who had no alternative- than the fact that the proceeding was disapproved of by the person whose orders he dared to plead as his excuse ? The pious deacon by whose hand we send this was himself associated with the bishop whom we had sent to intercede for them; let him, therefore, relate to your Excellency how it i seemed good to the Emperor not even to give a formal pardon, lest by this the stigma of a crime should be in some degree attached to them, but a mere notice commanding them to be immediately set at liberty from all further annoyance. By a purely gratuitous act of cruelty, and under no pressure of necessity (although, perchance, there may have been other causes which we suspect, but which it is unnecessary to state in writing), he did outrageously vex the Church, -- the Church to whose sheltering bosom his brother once, in fear of death, had fled, to be requited for protecting his life by finding him active in counselling the perpetration of this crime, -- the Church in which he himself had once, when under the displeasure of an offended patron, sought an asylum which could not be denied to him. If you love this man, show your detestation of his crime; if you do not wish him to<br>
f come into everlasting punishment, shrink with horror from his society. You are bound to take measures of this kind, both for your own good name and for his life; for he who loves in this man what God hates, is, in truth, hating not only this man but also his own soul.<br>
     12. These things being so, I know your benevolence too well to believe that you were the author of this crime, or an accomplice in its commission, or that with malicious cruelty you deceived us: far be such conduct from your life and conversation ! At the same time, I would not wish your friendship to be of such a character as tends to make him, to his own destruction, glory in his crime, and to confirm the suspicions naturally cherished by men concerning you; but rather let it be such as to move him to penitence, and to penitence corresponding in quality and in measure to the remedy demanded for the healing of such dreadful wounds. For the more you are an enemy to his crimes, the more really will you be a friend to the man himself. It will be interesting to us to learn, by your Excellency's reply to this letter, where you were on the day on which the crime was committed, how you received the tidings, and what you did thereafter, and what you said to him and heard from him when you next saw him; for I have not been able to hear anything of you in connection with this affair since my sudden departure on the succeeding day.<br>
    13. As to the remark in your letter that you are now compelled to believe that I refuse to visit Carthage for fear lest you should be seen there by me, you rather compel me by these words to state explicitly the reasons of my absence. One reason is, that the labour which<br>
<br>
509<br>
<br>
I am obliged to undergo in that city, and which I could not describe without adding as much again to the length of this letter, is more than I am able now to bear, since, in addition to my infirmities peculiar to myself, which are known to all my more intimate friends, I am .burdened with an infirmity common to the human family, namely, the weakness of old age. The other reason is, that, in so far as leisure is granted me from the work imperatively demanded by the Church, which my office specially binds me to serve, I have resolved to devote the time entirely, if the Lord will, to the labour of studies pertaining to ecclesiastical learning; in doing which I think that I may, if it please the mercy of God, be of some service even to future generations.<br>
    14. There is, indeed, one thing in you, since you wish to hear the truth, which causes me very great distress: it is that, although qualified by age, as well as by life and character, to do otherwise, you still prefer to be a catechumen; as if it were not possible for believers, by making progress in Christian faith and well-doing, to become so much the more faithful and useful in the administration of public business. For surely the promotion of the welfare of men is the one great end of all your great cares and labours. And, indeed, if this were not to be the issue of your public services, it would be better for you even to sleep both day and night than to sacrifice your rest in order to do work which can contribute nothing to the advantage of your fellow-men. Nor do I entertain the slightest doubt that your Excellency . . .<br>

<br>
                      LETTER CLVIII. (A.D. 414.)<br>
	TO MY LORD AUGUSTIN, MY BROTHER PARTNER IN THE SACERDOTAL OFFICE, MOST SINCERELY LOVED, WITH PROFOUND RESPECT, AND TO THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM, EVODIUS1 AND THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM SEND GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
I. I urgently beg you to send the reply due to my last letter. Indeed, I would have preferred first to learn what I then asked, and afterwards to put the questions which I now submit to you. Give me your attention while I relate an event in which you will kindly take an interest, and which has made me impatient to lose no time in acquiring, if possible in this life, the knowledge which I desired. I had a certain youth as a clerk, a son of presbyter Armenus of Melonita, whom, by my humble instrumentality, God rescued when he was becoming already immersed in secular affairs, for he was employed as a shorthand writer by the proconsul's solicitor.2 He was then, indeed, as boys usually are, prompt and somewhat restless, but as he grew older (for his death occurred in his twenty-second year) a gravity of deportment and circumspect probity of life so adorned him that it is a pleasure to dwell upon his memory. He was, moreover, a clever stenographer, 3 and indefatigable in writing: he had begun also to be earnest in reading, so that he even urged me to do more than my indolence would have chosen, in order to spend hours of the night in reading, for he read aloud to me for a time every night after all was still; and in reading, he would not pass over any sentence unless he understood it, and would ?go over it a third or even a fourth time, and not leave it until what he wished to know was made clear. I had begun to regard him not as a mere boy and clerk, but as a comparatively intimate and pleasant friend, for his conversation gave me much delight.<br>
    2. He desired also to "depart and to be with Christ,"4 a desire which has been fulfilled. For he was ill for sixteen days in his father's house, and by strength of memory he continually repeated portions of Scripture throughout almost the whole time of his illness. But when he was very near to the end of his life, he sang s so as to be heard by all, "My soul longeth for and hastens unto the courts of the Lord,''6 after which he sang again, "Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and beautiful is Thy cup, overpowering my senses with delight!"7 In these things he was wholly occupied; in the consolation yielded by them he found satisfaction. At the last, when dissolution was just coming upon him, he began to make the sign of the cross on his forehead, and in finishing this his hand was moving down to his mouth, which also he wished to mark with the same sign, but the inward man (which had been truly renewed day by day) s had, ere this was done, forsaken the tabernacle of clay. To myself there has been given so great an ecstasy of joy, that I think that after leaving his own body he has entered into my spirit, and is there imparting to me a certain fulness of light from his presence, for I am conscious of a joy beyond all measure through his deliverance and safety -- indeed it is ineffable. For I felt no small anxiety on his<br>
<br>
510<br>
<br>
account, being afraid of the dangers peculiar to his years. For I was at pains to inquire of himself whether perchance he had been defiled by intercourse with woman; he solemnly assured us that he was free from this stain, by which declaration our joy was still more increased. So he died. We honored his memory by suitable obsequies, such as were due to one so excellent, for we continued during three days to praise the Lord with hymns at his grave, and on the third day we offered the sacraments of redemption.1<br>
<br>
3. Behold, however, two days thereafter, a certain respectable widow from Figentes, an handmaid from God, who said that she had been twelve years in widowhood saw the following vision in a dream. She saw a certain deacon, who had died four years ago, preparing a palace, I with the assistance of servants and handmaids of God (virgins and widows). It was being so much adorned that the place was refulgent with splendor, and appeared to be wholly made of silver. On her inquiring eagerly for whom this palace was being prepared, the, deacon aforesaid answered, "For the young man, the son of the t presbyter, who was cut off yesterday." There appeared in the same palace an old man robed in white, who grave orders to two others, also dressed in white, to go, and having raised the body from the grave, to carry it up with them to heaven. And she added, that so soon as the body had been taken up from the grave and carried to heaven, there sprang from the same sepulchre branches of the rose, called from its folded blossoms the virgin rose.<br>
    4. I have narrated the event: listen now, if you please, to my question, and teach me what I ask, for the departure of that young man's soul forces such questions from me. While we are in the body, we have an inward faculty of perception which is alert in proportion to the activity of our attention, and' is more wakeful and eager the more earnestly attentive we become: and it see?as to us probable that even in its highest activity it is retarded by the encumbrance of the body, for who can fully describe all that the mind suffers through the body ! In the midst of the perturbation and annoyance which come from the suggestions, temptations, necessities, and varied afflictions of which the body is the cause, the mind does not surrender its strength, it resists and conquers. Sometimes J it is defeated; nevertheless, mindful of what is its own nature, it becomes, under the stimulating influence of such labours, more active and more wary, and breaks through the meshes of wickedness, and so makes its way to better! things. Your Holiness will kindly understand what I mean to say. Therefore, while we are in this life, we are hindered by such deficiencies, and are nevertheless, as it is written, "more than conquerors through Him that loved us."2 When we go forth from this body, and escape from every burden, and from sin, with its incessant activity, what are we ?<br>
    5. In the first place, I ask whether there may not be some kind of body (formed, perchance, of one of the four elements, either air or ether) which does not depart from the incorporeal principle, that is, the substance properly called the soul, when it forsakes this earthly body. For as the soul is in its nature incorporeal, if it be absolutely disembodied by death there is now one soul of all that have left this world. And in that case where would the rich man, who was clothed in purple, and Lazarus, who was full of sores, now be ? How, moreover, could they be distinguished according to their respective deserts, so that the one should have suffering and the other have joy, if there were only a single soul made by the combination of all disembodied souls, unless, of course, these things are to be understood in a figurative sense ? Be that as it may, there is no question that souls which are held in definite places (as that rich man was in the flame, and that poor man was in Abraham's bosom) are held in bodies. If there are distinct places, there are bodies, and in these bodies the souls reside; and even although the punishments and rewards are experienced in the conscience, the soul which experiences them is nevertheless in a body. Whatever is the nature of that one soul made hp of many souls, it must be possible for it in its unbroken unity to be both grieved and made glad at the same moment, if it is to approve itself to be really a substance consisting of many souls gathered into one. If, however, this soul is called one only in the same way as the incorporeal mind is called one, although it has in it memory, and will, and intellect, and if it be alleged that all these are separate incorporeal causes or powers and have their several distinctive offices and work without one impeding another in any way, I think this might be in some measure answered by saying that it must be also possible for some of the souls to be under punishment and some of the sours to enjoy rewards simultaneously in this one substance consisting of many souls gathered into One.<br>
    6. Or if this be not so [that is, if there be no such body remaining still in union with the incorporeal principle after it quits this earthly body], what is there to hinder each soul from having, when separated from the solid body which it here inhabits, another body, so that the soul always I animates a body of some kind ? or in what body<br>
<br>
511<br>
<br>
does it pass to any region, if such there be, to which necessity compels it to go? For the angels themselves, if they were not numbered by bodies of some kind which they have, could not be called many, as they are by the Truth Himself when He said in the gospel, "I could pray the Father, and He will presently give me twelve legions of angels.", Again it is certain that Samuel was seen in the body when he was raised at the request of Saul; ' and as to Moses, whose body was buried, it is plain from the gospel narrative that he came in the body to the Lord on the mountain to which He and His disciples had retired.s In the Apocrypha, and in the Mysteries of Moses, a writing which is wholly devoid of authority, it is indeed said that, at the time when he ascended the mount to die, through the power which his body possessed, there was one body which was committed to the earth, and another which was joined to the angel who accompanied him; but I do not feel myself called upon to give to a sentence in apocryphal writings a preference over the definite statements quoted above. We must therefore give attention to this, and search out, by the help either of the authority of revelation or of the light o reason, the matter about which we are inquiring. But it is alleged that the future resurrection of the body is a proof that the soul was after death absolutely without a body. This is not, however, an unanswerable objection, for the angels, who are like our souls invisible, have at times desired to appear in bodily forms and be seen, and (whatever might be the form of body worthy to be assumed by these spirits) they have appeared, for example, to Abraham4 and to Tobias.5 Therefore it is quite possible that the resurrection of the body may, as we assuredly believe, take place, and yet that the soul may be reunited to it without its being found to have been at any moment wholly devoid of some kind of body. Now the body which the soul here occupies consists of the four elements, of which one, namely heat, seems to depart from this body at the same moment as the soul. For there remains after death that which is made of earth, moisture also is not wanting to the body, nor is the element of cold matter gone; heat alone has fled, which perhaps the soul takes along with it if it migrates from place to place. This is all that I say meanwhile concerning the body.<br>
    7. It seems to me also, that if the soul while occupying the living body is capable, as I have said, of strenuous mental application, how much more unencumbered, active, vigorous, earnest, resolute, and persevering will it be, how much enlarged in capacity and improved in character, if it has while in this body learned to relish virtue ! For after laying aside this body, or rather, after having this cloud swept away, the soul will have come to be free from all disturbing influences, enjoying tranquillity and exempt from temptation, seeing whatever it has longed for, and embracing what it has loved. Then, also, it will be capable of remembering and recognising friends, both those who went before it from this world, and those whom it left here below. Perhaps this may be true. I know not, but I desire to learn. But it would greatly distress me to think that the soul after death passes into a state of torpor, being as it were buried, just as it is during sleep while it is in the body, living only in hope, but having nothing and knowing nothing, especially if in its sleep it be not even stirred by any dreams. This notion causes me very great horror, and seems to indicate that the life of the soul is extinguished at death.<br>
    8. This also I would ask: Supposing that the soul be discovered to have such a body as we speak of, does that body lack any of the senses ? Of course, if there cannot be imposed upon it any necessity for smelling, tasting, or touching, as I suppose will be the case, these senses will be wanting; but I hesitate as to the senses of sight and hearing. For are not devils said to hear (not, indeed, in all the persons whom they harass, for in regard to these there is a question), even when they appear in bodies of their own ? And as to the faculty of sight, how can they pass from one place to another if they have a body but are void of the power of seeing, so as to guide its motions? Do you think that this is not the case with human souls when they go forth from the body,--that they have still a body of some kind, and are not deprived of some at least of the senses proper to this body ? Else how can we explain the fact that very many dead persons have been observed by day, or by persons awake and walking abroad during the I night, to pass into houses just as they were wont to do in their lifetime ? This I have heard not once, but often; and I have also heard it said that in places in which dead bodies are interred, and especially in churches, there are commotions and prayers which are heard for the most part at a certain time of the night. This I remember hearing from more than one: for a certain holy presbyter was an eye-witness of such an apparition, having observed a multitude of such phantoms issuing from the baptistery in bodies full of light, after which he heard their prayers in the midst of the church itself. All such things are either true, and therefore helpful to the inquiry which we are now making, or are mere fables, in which case the fact of their invention<br>
<br>
512<br>
<br>
is wonderful; nevertheless I would desire to get some information from the fact that they come and visit men, and are seen otherwise than in dreams.<br>
    9. These dreams suggest another question. I do not at this moment concern myself about the mere creations of fancy, which are formed by the emotions of the uneducated. I speak of visitations in sleep, such as the apparition to Joseph: in a dream, in the manner experienced in most cases of the kind. In the same manner, therefore, our own friends also who have departed this life before us sometimes come and appear to us in dreams, and speak to us. For I myself remember that Profuturus, and Privatus, and Servilius, holy men who within my recollection were removed by death from our monastery, spoke to me, and that the events of which they spoke came to pass according to their words. Or if it be some other higher spirit that assumes their form and visits our minds, I leave this to the all-seeing eye of Him before whom everything from the highest to the lowest is uncovered.' If, therefore, the Lord be pleased to speak through reason to your Holiness on all these questions, I beg you to be so kind as make me partaker of the knowledge which you have received. There is another thing which I have resolved not to omit mentioning, for perhaps it bears upon the matter now under investigation:<br>
    10. This same youth, in connection with whom these questions are brought forward, departed tiffs life after having received what may be called a summons2 at the time when he was dying. For one who had been a companion of his as a student, and reader, and shorthand writer to my dictation, who had died eight months before, was seen by a person in a dream coming towards him. When he was asked by the person who then distinctly saw him why he had come, he said, "I have come to take this friend away;" and so it proved. For in the house itself, also, there appeared to a certain old man, who was almost awake, a man bearing in his hand a laurel branch on which something was written. Nay, more, when this one was seen, it is further reported that after the death of the young man, his father the presbyter had begun to reside along with the aged Theasius in the monastery, in order to find consolation there, but lo ! on the third day after his death, the young man is seen entering the monastery, and is asked by one of the brethren in a dream of some kind whether he knew himself to be dead. He replied that he knew he was. The other asked whether he had been welcomed by God. This also he answered with great expressions of joy. And when questioned as to the reason why he had come, he answered, "I have been sent to summon my father." The person to whom these things were shown awakes, and relates what had passed. It comes to the ear of Bishop Theasius. He, being alarmed, sharply admonished the person who told him, lest the matter should come, as it might easily do, to the ear of the presbyter himself, and he should be disturbed by such tidings. But why prolong the narration ? Within about four days from this visitation he was saying (for he had suffered from a moderate feverishness) that he was now out of danger, and that the physician had given up attending him, having assured him that there was no cause whatever for anxiety; but that very day this presbyter expired after he had lain down on his couch. Nor should I forbear mentioning, that on the same day on which the youth died, he asked his father three times to forgive him anything in which he might have offended, and every time that he kissed his father he said to him, "Let us give thanks to God, father," and insisted upon his father saying the words along with him, as if he were exhorting one who was to be his companion in going forth from this world. And in fact only seven days elapsed between the two deaths. What shall we say of things so wonderful ? Who shall be a thoroughly reliable teacher as to these mysterious dispensations? To you in the hour of perplexity my agitated heart unburdens itself. The divine appointment of the death of the young man and of his father is beyond all doubt, for two sparrows shall not fall to the ground without the will of our heavenly Father. 3<br>
    11. That the soul cannot exist in absolute separation from a body of some kind is proved in my opinion by the fact that to exist without body belongs to God alone. But I think that the laying aside of so great a burden as the body, in the act of passing from this world, proves that the soul will then be very much more wakeful than it is meanwhile; for then the soul appears, as I think, far more noble when no longer encumbered by so great a hindrance, both in action and in knowledge, and that entire spiritual rest proves it to be free from all causes of disturbance and error, but does not make it languid, and as it were slow, torpid, and embarrassed, inasmuch as it is enough for the soul to enjoy in its fulness the liberty to which it has attained in being freed from the world and the body; for, as you have wisely said, the intellect is satisfied with food, and applies the lips of the spirit to the fountain of life in that condition in which it is happy and blest in the undisputed lordship of its own faculties. For before I quitted the monastery I saw brother Servilius in<br>
<br>
513<br>
<br>
a dream after his decease, and he said that we were labouring to attain by the exercise of reason to an understanding of truth, whereas he and those who were in the same state as he were always resting in the pure joy of contemplation.<br>
    12. I also beg you to explain to me in how many ways the word wisdom is used; as God is wisdom, and a wise mind is wisdom (in which way it is said to be as light); as we read also of the wisdom of Bezaleel, who made the tabernacle or the ointment, and the wisdom of Solomon, or any other wisdom, if there be such, and wherein they differ from each other; and whether the one eternal Wisdom which is with the Father is to be understood as spoken of in these different degrees, as they are called diverse gifts of the Holy Spirit, who divideth to every one severally according as He will. Or, with the exception of that Wisdom alone which was not created, were these created, and have they a distinct existence of their own ? or are they effects, and have they received their name from the definition of their work P I am asking a great many questions. May the Lord grant you grace to discover the truth sought, and wisdom sufficient to commit it to writing, and to communicate it without delay to me. I have written in much ignorance, and in a homely style; but since you think it worth while to know that about which I am inquiring, I beseech you in the name of Christ the Lord to correct me where I am mistaken, and teach me what you know that I am desirous to learn.<br>

                             LETTER CLIX.<br>
                              (A.D. 415.)<br>
	TO EVODIUS, MY LORD MOST BLESSED, MY VENERABLE AND BELOVED BROTHER AND PARTNER IN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE, AND TO THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM, AUGUSTIN AND THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM SEND GREETING<br>
<br>
IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
   I. Our brother Barbarus, the bearer of this letter, is a servant of God, who has now for a long time been settled at Hippo, and has been an eager and diligent hearer of the word of God. He requested from us this letter to your Holiness, whereby we commend him to you in the Lord, and convey to you through him the salutations which it is our duty to offer. To reply to those letters of your Holiness, in which you have interwoven questions of great difficulty, would be a most laborious task, even for men who are at leisure, and who are endowed with much greater ability in discussing and acuteness in apprehending any subject than we possess. One, indeed, of the two letters in which you ask many great questions has gone amissing, I know not how, and though long sought for cannot be found; the other, which has been found, contains a very pleasing account of a servant of God, a good and chaste young man, stating how he departed from this life, and by what testimonies, communicated through visions of the brethren, his merits were, as you state, made known to you. Taking occasion from this young man's case, you propose and discuss an extremely obscure question concerning the soul, --whether it is associated when it goes forth from this body with some other kind of body, by means of which it can be carried to or confined in places having material boundaries? The investigation of this question, if indeed it admits of satisfactory investigation by beings such as we are, demands the most diligent care and labour, and therefore a mind absolutely at leisure from such occupations as engross my time. My opinion, however, if you are willing to hear it, summed up in a sentence, is, that I by no means believe that the soul in departing from the body is accompanied by another body of any kind.<br>
    2. As to the question how these visions and predictions of future events are produced, let him attempt to explain them who understands by what power we are to account for the great wonders which are wrought in the mind of every man when his thoughts are busy. For we see, and we plainly perceive, that within the mind innumerable images of many objects discernible by the eye or by our other senses are produced, --whether they are produced in regular order or in confusion matters not to us at present: all that we say is, that since such images are beyond all dispute produced, the man who is found able to state by what power and in what way these phenomena of daily and perpetual experience are to be accounted for is the only man who may warrantably venture to conjecture or propound any explanation of these visions, which are of exceedingly rare occurrence. For my part, as I discover more plainly my inability to account for the ordinary facts of our experience, when awake or asleep, throughout the whole course of our lives, the more do I shrink from venturing to explain what is extraordinary. For while I have been dictating this epistle to you, I have been contemplating your person in my mind,- you being, of course, absent all the while, and knowing nothing of my thoughts, -- and I have been imagining from my knowledge of what is in you how you will be affected by my words; and I have been unable to apprehend, either by observation or by inquiry, how this process was accomplished in my mind. Of one thing, however, I am certain, that although the mental image was very like something material, it was not produced either by masses of matter or by qualities<br>
<br>
514<br>
<br>
of matter. Accept this in the meantime from one writing under pressure of other duties, and in haste. In the twelfth of the books which I have written on Genesis this question is discussed with great care, and that dissertation is enriched with a forest of examples from actual experience or from trustworthy report. How far I have been competent to handle the question, and what I have accomplished in it, you will judge when you have read that work; if indeed the Lord shall be pleased m His kindness to permit me now to publish those books systematically corrected to the best of my ability, and thus to meet the expectation of many brethren, instead of deferring their hope by continuing further the discussion of a subject which has already engaged me for a long time.<br>
    3. I will narrate briefly, however, one fact which I commend to your meditation. You know our brother Gennadius, a physician, known to almost every one, and very dear to us, who now lives at Carthage, and was in other years eminent as a medical practitioner at Rome. You know him as a man of religious character and of very great benevolence, actively compassionate and promptly liberal in his care of the poor. Nevertheless, even he, when still a young man, and most zealous in these charitable acts, had sometimes, as he himself told me, doubts as to whether there was any life after death. Forasmuch, therefore, as God would in no wise forsake a man so merciful in his disposition and conduct, there appeared to him in sleep a youth of remarkable appearance and commanding presence, who said to him: "Follow me." Following him, he came to a city where he began to hear on the right hand sounds of a melody so exquisitely sweet as to surpass anything he had ever heard. When he inquired what it was, his guide said: "It is the hymn of the blessed and the holy." What he reported himself to have seen on the left hand escapes my remembrance. He awoke; the dream vanished, and he thought of it as only a dream.<br>
    4. On a second night, however, the same youth appeared to Gennadius, and asked whether he recognised him, to which he replied that he knew him well, without the slightest uncertainty. Thereupon he asked Gennadius where he had become acquainted with him. There also his memory failed him not as to the proper reply: he narrated the whole vision, and the hymns of the saints which, under his guidance, he had been taken to hear, with all the readiness natural to recollection of some very recent experience. On this the youth inquired whether it was in sleep or when awake that he had seen what he had just narrated. Gennadius answered: "In sleep." The youth then said: "You remember it well; it is true that you saw these things in sleep, but I would have you know that even now you are seeing in sleep." Hearing this, Gennadius was persuaded of its truth, and in his reply declared that he believed it. Then his teacher went on to say: "Where is your body now?" He answered: "In my bed." "Do you know," said the youth, "that the eyes in this body of yours are now bound and closed, and at rest, and e that with these eyes you are seeing nothing?" He answered: "I know it." "What, then, said the youth, "are the eyes with which you see me?" He, unable to discover what to answer to this, was silent. While he hesitated, the youth unfolded to him what he was endeavoring to teach him by these questions, and forthwith said: "' As while you are asleep and lying on your bed these eyes of your body are now unemployed and doing nothing, and yet you have eyes with which you behold me, and enjoy this vision, so, after your death, while your bodily eyes shall be wholly inactive, there shall be in you a life by which you shall still live, and a faculty of perception by which you shall still perceive. Beware, therefore, after this of harbouring doubts as to whether the life of man shall continue after death." This believer says that by this means all doubts as to this matter were removed from him. By whom was he taught this but by the merciful, providential care of God ?<br>
    5. Some one may say that by this narrative I have not solved but complicated the question. Nevertheless, while it is free to every one to believe or disbelieve these statements, every man has his own consciousness at hand as a teacher by whose help he may apply himself to this most profound question. Every day man wakes, and sleeps, and thinks; let any man, therefore, answer whence proceed these things which, while not material bodies, do nevertheless resemble the forms, properties, and motions of material bodies: let him, I say, answer this if he can. But if he cannot do this, why is he in such haste to pronounce a definite opinion on things which occur very rarely, or are beyond the range of his experience, when he is unable to explain matters of daily and perpetual observation? For my part, although I am wholly unable to explain in words how those semblances of material bodies, without any real body, are produced, I may say that I wish that, with the same certainty with which I know that these things are not produced by the body, I could know by what means those things are perceived which are occasionally seen by the spirit, and are supposed to be seen by the bodily senses; or by what distinctive marks we may know the visions of men who have been misguided by delusion, or, most commonly, by impiety, since the examples of such visions closely resembling the visions of pious and holy men are so numerous, that if I wished to quote<br>
<br>
515<br>
<br>
them, time, rather than abundance of examples, would fail me.<br>
    May you, through the mercy of the Lord grow m grace, most blessed lord and venerable and beloved brother !<br>

			    LETTER CLXIII. (A.D. 414.)<br>
               TO BISHOP AUGUSTIN, BISHOP EVODIUS SENDS<br>
                               GREETING.<br>
<br>
    Some time ago I sent two questions to your Holiness; the tint, which was sent, I think, by Jobinus, a servant in the nunnery,1 related to God and reason, and the second was in regard to the opinion that the body of the Saviour is capable of seeing the substance of the Deity. I now propound a third question: Does the rational soul which our Saviour assumed along with His body fall under any one of the theories' commonly advanced in discussions on the origin of souls (ff any theory indeed can be with certainty established on the subject),- or does His soul, though rational, belong not to any of the species under which the souls of living creatures are classified, but to another?<br>
    I ask also a fourth question: Who are those spirits in reference to whom the Apostle Peter testifies concerning the Lord in these words: "Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit, in which also He went and preached to the spirits in prison ?" giving us to understand that they were in hell, and that Christ descending into hell, preached the gospel to them all, and by grace delivered them all from darkness and punishment, so that from the time of the resurrection of the Lord judgment is expected, hell having then been completely emptied.<br>
    What your Holiness believes in this matter I earnestly desire to know.<br>
<br>
                       LETTER CLXIV. (A.D. 414.)<br>
	TO MY LORD EVODIUS MOST BLESSED, MY BROTHER AND PARTNER IN THE EPISCOPAL OFFICE, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. The question which you have proposed to me from the epistle of the Apostle Peter is one which, as I think you are aware, is wont to perplex me most seriously, namely, how the words which you have quoted are to be understood on the supposition that they were spoken concerning hell ? I therefore refer this question back to yourself, that if either you yourself be able, or can find any other person who is able to do so, you may remove and terminate my perplexities on the subject. If the Lord grant to me ability to understand the words before you do, and it be in my power to impart what I receive from Him to you, I will not withhold it from a friend so truly loved. In the meantime, I will communicate to you the things in the passage which occasion difficulty to me, that, keeping in view these remarks on the words of the apostle, you may either exercise your own thoughts on them, or consult any one whom you find competent to pronounce an opinion.<br>
    2. After having said that "Christ was put to death in the flesh, and quickened in the spirit," the apostle immediately went on to say: "in which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison; which sometime were unbelieving, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water;" thereafter he added the words: "which baptism also now by a like figure has saved you." 3 This, therefore, is felt by me to be difficult. If the Lord when He died preached in hell to spirits in prison, why were those who continued unbelieving while the ark was a preparing the only ones counted worthy of this favour, namely, the Lord's descending into hell? For in the ages between the time of Noah and the passion of Christ, there died many thousands of so many nations whom He might have found in hell. I do not, of course, speak here of those who in that period of time had believed in God, as, e.g. the prophets and patriarchs of Abraham's line, or, going father back, Noah himself and his house, who had been saved by water (excepting perhaps the one son, who afterwards was rejected), and, in addition to these, all others outside of the posterity of Jacob who were believers in God, such as Job, the citizens of Nineveh, and any others, whether mentioned in Scripture or existing unknown to us in the vast human family at any time. I speak only of those many thousands of men who, ignorant of God and devoted to the worship of devils or of idols, had passed out of this life from the time of Noah to the passion of Christ. How was it that Christ, finding these in hell, did not preach to them, but preached only to those who were unbelieving in the days of Noah when the ark was a preparing ? Or if he preached to all, why has Peter mentioned only these, and passed over the innumerable multitude of others ?<br>
    CHAP. II. 3. -- It is established beyond question that the Lord, after He had been put to death in the flesh, "descended into hell ;" for it is impossible to gainsay either that utterance of prophecy, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in<br>
<br>
516<br>
<br>
hell," '--an utterance which Peter himself expounds in the Acts of the Apostles, lest any one should venture to put upon it another interpretation, -- or the words of the same apostle, in which he affirms that the Lord "loosed the pains of hell, in which it was not possible for Him to be holden."2 Who, therefore, except an infidel, will deny that Christ was in hell ? As to the difficulty which is found in reconciling the statement that the pains of hell were loosed by Him, with the fact that He had never begun to be in these pains as in bonds, and did not so loose them as if He had broken off chains by which He had been bound, this is easily removed when we understand that they were loosed in the same way as the snares of huntsmen may be loosed to prevent their holding, not because they have taken hold. It may also be understood as teaching us to believe Him to have loosed those pains which could not possibly hold Him, but which were holding those to whom He had resolved to grant deliverance.<br>
    4. But who these were it is presumptuous for us to define. For if we say that all who were found there were then delivered without exception, who will not rejoice if we can prove this ? Especially will men rejoice for the sake of some who are intimately known to us by their literary labours, whose eloquence and talent we admire, --not only the poets and orators who in many parts of their writings have held up to contempt and ridicule these same false gods of the nations, and have even occasionally confessed the one true God, although along with the rest they observed superstitious rites, but also those who have uttered the same, not in poetry or rhetoric, but as philosophers: and for the sake of many more of whom we have no literary remains, but in regard to whom we have learned from the writings of these others that their lives were to a certain extent praiseworthy, so that (with the exception of their service of God, in which they erred, worshipping the vanities which had been set up as objects of public worship, and serving the creature rather than the Creator) they may be justly held up as models in all the other virtues of frugality, self-denial, chastity, sobriety, braving of death in their country's defence, and faith kept inviolate not only to fellow-citizens, but also to enemies. All these things, indeed, when they are practised with a view not to the great end of right and true piety, but to the empty pride of human praise and glory, become in a sense worthless and unprofitable; nevertheless, as indications of a certain disposition of mind, they please us so much that we would desire those in whom they exist, either by special preference or along with' the others, to be freed from the pains of hell, were not the verdict of human feeling different from that of the justice of the Creator.<br>
5. These things being so, if the Saviour delivered all from that place, and, to quote the terms of the question in your letter, "emptied hell, so that now from that time forward the last judgment was to be expected," the following things occasion not unreasonable perplexity on this subject, and are wont to present themselves to me in the meantime when I think on it. First, by what authoritative statements can this opinion be confirmed ? For the words of Scripture, that "the pains of hell were loosed" by the death of Christ, do not establish this, seeing that this statement may be understood as referring to Himself, and meaning that he so far loosed (that is, made ineffectual) the pains of hell that He Himself was not held by them, especially since it is added that it was "impossible for Him to be holden of them." Or if any one [objecting to this interpretation] ask the reason why He chose to descend into hell, where those pains were which could not possibly hold Him who was, as Scripture says, "free among the dead," 3 in whom the prince and captain of death found nothing which deserved punishment, the words that "the pains of hell were loosed" may be understood as referring not to the case of all, but only of some whom He judged worthy of that deliverance; so that neither is He supposed to have descended thither in vain, without the purpose of bringing benefit to any of those who were there held in prison, nor is it a necessary inference that what divine mercy and justice granted to some must be supposed to have been granted to all.<br>
    CHAP. III. 6. As to the first man, the father of mankind, it is agreed by almost the entire Church that the Lord loosed him from that prison; a tenet which must be believed to have been accepted not without reason,- from whatever source it was handed down to the Church,although the authority of the canonical Scriptures cannot be brought forward as speaking expressly in its support,4 though this seems to be the opinion which is more than any other borne out by these words in the book of Wisdom.s Some add to this [tradition] that the same favour was bestowed on the holy men of antiquity,on Abel, Seth, Noah and his house, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the other patriarchs and prophets, they also being loosed from those pains at the time when the Lord descended into hell. 7. But, for my part, I cannot see how Abra-<br>
<br>
517<br>
<br>
ham, into whose bosom also the pious beggar in the parable was received, can be understood to have been in these pains; those who are able can perhaps explain this. But I suppose every one must see it to be absurd to imagine that only two, namely, Abraham and Lazarus, were in that bosom of wondrous repose before the Lord descended into hell, and that with reference to these two alone it was said to the rich man, "Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot, neither can they pass to us that would pass from thence."' Moreover, if there were more than two there, who will dare to say that the patriarchs and prophets were not there, to whose righteousness and piety so signal testimony is borne in the word of God ? What benefit was conferred in that case on them by Him who loosed the pains of hell, in which they were not held, I do not yet understand, especially as I have not been able to find anywhere in Scripture the name of hell used in a good sense. And if this use of the term is nowhere found in the divine Scriptures, assuredly the bosom of Abraham, that is, the abode of a certain secluded rest, is not' to be believed to be a part of hell. Nay, from these words themselves of the great Master in which He says that Abraham said, "Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed," it is, as I think, sufficiently evident that the bosom of that glorious felicity was not any integral part of hell. For what is that great gulf but a chasm completely separating those places between which it not only is, but is fixed? Wherefore, if sacred Scripture had said, without naming hell and its pains, that Christ when He died went to that bosom of Abraham, I wonder ff any one would have dared to say that He "descended into hell."<br>
    8. But seeing that plain scriptural testimonies make mention of hell and its pains, no reason; can be alleged for believing that He who is the i Saviour went thither, except that He might save from its pains; but whether He did save all whom He found held in them, or some whom He judged worthy of that favour, I still ask: that He was, however, in hell, and that He conferred this benefit on persons subjected to these pains, I do not doubt. Wherefore, I have not yet found what benefit He, when He descended into hell, conferred upon those righteous ones who were in Abraham's bosom, from whom I see that, so far as regarded the beatific presence of His Godhead, He never withdrew Himself; since even on that very day on which He died, He promised that the thief should be with Him in paradise at the time when He was about to descend to loose the pains of hell. Most certainly, therefore, He was, before that time, both in paradise and the bosom of Abraham in His beatific wisdom, and in hell in His condemning power; for since the Godhead is confined by no limits, where is He not present ? At the same time, however, so far as regarded the created nature, in assuming which at a certain point of time, He, while continuing to be God, became man -- that is to say, so far as regarded His soul, He was in hell: this is plainly declared in these words of Scripture, which were both sent before in prophecy and filly expounded by apostolical interpretation: "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell." 2<br>
    9. I know that some think that at the death of Christ a resurrection such as is promised to us at the end of the world was granted to the righteous, founding this on the statement in Scripture that, in the earthquake by which at the moment of His death the rocks were rent and the graves were opened, many bodies of the saints arose and were seen with Him in the Holy City after He rose. Certainly, if these did not fall asleep again, their bodies being a second time laid in the grave, it would be necessary to see in what sense Christ can be understood to 'be "the first begotten from the dead," 3 if so many preceded Him in the resurrection. And if it be said, in answer to this, that the statement is made by anticipation, so that the graves indeed are to be supposed to have been opened by that earthquake at the time when Christ was hanging on the cross, but that the bodies of the saints did not rise then, but only after Christ had risen before them, -- although on this hypothesis of anticipation in the narrative, the addition of these words would not hinder us from still believing, on the one hand, that Christ was without doubt "the first begotten from the dead," and on the other, that to these saints permission was given, when He went before them, to rise to an eternal state of incorruption and immortality,there still remains a difficulty, namely, how in that case Peter could have spoken as he did, saying what was without doubt perfectly true, when he affirmed that in the prophecy quoted above the words, that "His flesh should not see corruption," referred not to David but to Christ, and added concerning David, "He is buried, and his sepulchre is with us to this day," 4 m a statement which would have had no force as an argument unless the body of David was still undisturbed in the sepulchre; for of course the sepulchre might still have been there even had the saint's body been raised up immediately after his death, and had thus not seen corruption. But it seems hard that David should not be<br>
<br>
518<br>
<br>
included in this resurrection of the saints, if eternal life was given to them, since it is so frequently, so clearly, and with such honourable mention of his name, declared that Christ was to be of David's seed. Moreover, these words in the Epistle to the Hebrews concerning the ancient believers, "God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect,"' will be endangered, if these believers have been already established in that incorruptible resurrection-state which is promised to us when we are to be made perfect at the end of the world.<br>
    CHAP. IV. -- 10. You perceive, therefore, how intricate is the question why Peter chose to mention, as persons to whom, when shut up in prison, the gospel was preached, those only who were unbelieving in the days of Noah when the ark was a preparing -- and also the difficulties which prevent me from pronouncing any definite opinion on the subject. An additional reason for my hesitation is, that after the apostle had said, "Which baptism now by a like figure saves you ( not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is on the right hand of God, having swallowed up death that we might be made heirs of eternal life; and having gone into heaven, angels, and authorities, and powers being made subject to Him," he added: "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God;" after which he continues: "For the time: past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousess, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: wherein Z they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you; who shall give account to Him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead." After these! words he subjoins: "For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit."2<br>
    11. Who can be otherwise than perplexed by words so profound as these? He saith, "The gospel was preached to the dead;" and if by the "dead" we understand persons who have' departed from the body, I suppose he must mean those described above as "unbelieving in the days of Noah," or certainly all those whom Christ found in hell. What, then, is meant by the words, "That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit "? For how can they be judged in the flesh, which if they be in hell they no longer have, and which if they have been loosed from the pains of hell they have not yet resumed? For even if" hell was," as you put in your question, "emptied," it is not to be believed that all who were then there have risen again in the flesh, or those who, arising, again appeared with the Lord resumed the flesh for this purpose, that they might be in it judged according to men; but how this could be taken as true in the case of those who were unbelieving in the days of Noah I do not see, for Scripture does not affirm that they were made to live in the flesh, nor can it be believed that the end for which they were loosed from the pains of hell was that they who were delivered from these might resume their flesh in order to suffer punishment. 'What, then, is meant by the words, "That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit?" Can it mean that to those whom Christ found in hell this was granted, that by the gospel they were quickened in the spirit, although at the future resurrection they must be judged in the flesh, that they may pass, through some punishment in the flesh, into the kingdom of God ? If this be what is meant, why were only the unbelievers of the time of Noah (and not also all others whom Christ found in hell when He went thither) quickened in spirit by the preaching of the gospel, to be afterwards judged in the flesh with a punishment of limited duration ? But if we take this as applying to all, the question still remains why Peter mentioned none but those who were unbelieving in the days of Noah.<br>
    12. I find, moreover, a difficulty in the reason alleged by those who attempt to give an explanation of this matter. They say that all those who were found in hell when Christ descended thither had never heard the gospel, and that that place of punishment or imprisonment was emptied of all these, because the gospel was not published to the whole world in their lifetime, and they had sufficient excuse for not believing that which had never been proclaimed to them; but that thenceforth, men despising the gospel when it was in all nations fully published and spread abroad would be inexcusable, and therefore after the prison was then emptied there still remains a just judgment, in which those who are contumacious and unbelieving shall be punished even with eternal fire. Those who hold this opinion do not consider that the same excuse is available for all those who have, even after Christ's resurrection, departed this life before the gospel came to them. For even after the Lord came back from hell, it was not the case that no one was from that time forward permitted<br>
<br>
519<br>
<br>
to go to hell without having heard the gospel, seeing that multitudes throughout the world died before the proclamation of its tidings came to them, all of whom are entitled to plead the excuse which is alleged to have been taken away from those of whom it is said, that because they had not before heard the gospel, the Lord when He descended into hell proclaimed it to them.<br>
    23. This objection may perhaps be met by saying that those also who since the Lord's resurrection have died or are now dying without the gospel having been proclaimed to them, may have heard it or may now hear it where they are, in hell, so that there they may believe what ought to be believed concerning the truth of Christ, and may also have that pardon and salvation which those to whom Christ preached obtained; for the fact that Christ ascended again from hell is no reason why the report concerning Him should have perished from recollection there, for from this earth also He has gone ascending into heaven, and yet by the publication of His gospel those who believe in Him shall be saved; moreover, He was exalted, and received a name that is above every name, for this end, I that in His name every knee should bow, not only of things in heaven and on earth, but also of things under the earth.1 But if we accept this opinion, according to which we are warranted in supposing that men who did not believe while they were in life can in hell believe in Christ, who can bear the contradictions both of reason and faith which must follow? In the first place, if this were true, we should seem to have no reason for mourning over those who have departed from the body without that grace, and there would be no ground for being solicitous and using urgent exhortation that men would accept the grace of God before they die, lest they should be punished with eternal death. If, again, it be alleged that in hell those only believe to no purpose and in vain who refused to accept here on earth the gospel preached to them, but that believing will profit those who never despised a gospel which they never had it in their power to hear another still more absurd consequence is involved, namely, that forasmuch as all men shall certainly die, and ought to come to hell wholly free from the guilt of having despised the gospel; since otherwise it can be of no use to them to believe it when they come there, the gospel ought not to be preached on earth, a sentiment not less foolish than profane.<br>
    CHAP. V. -- 14. Wherefore let us most firmly hold that which faith, resting on authority established beyond all question, maintains: "that Christ died according to the Scriptures," and that "He was buried," and that "He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures," and all other things which have been written concerning Him in records fully demonstrated to be true. Among these doctrines we include the doctrine that He was in hell, and, having loosed the pains of hell, in which it was impossible for Him to be holden, from which also He is with good ground believed to have loosed and delivered whom He would, He took again to Himself that body which He had left on the cross, land which had been laid in the tomb. These things, I say, let us firmly hold; but as to the question propounded by you from the words of the Apostle Peter, since you now perceive the difficulties which I find in it, and since other difficulties may possibly be found if the subject be more carefully studied, let us continue to investigate it, whether by applying our own thoughts to the subject, or by asking the opinion of any one whom it may be becoming and possible to consult.<br>
    15. Consider, however, I pray you, whether all that the Apostle Peter says concerning spirits shut up in prison, who were unbelieving in the days of Noah, may not after all have been written without any reference to hell, but rather to those times the typical character of which he has transferred to the present time. For that transaction had been typical of future events, so that those who do not believe the gospel in our age, when the Church is being built up in all nations, may be understood to be like those who did not believe in that age while the ark was a preparing; also, that those who have believed and are saved by baptism may be compared to those who at that time, being in the ark, were saved by water; wherefore he says, "So baptism by a like figure saves you." Let us therefore interpret the rest of the statements concerning them that believed not so as to harmonise with the analogy of the figure, and refuse to entertain the thought that the gospel was once preached, or is even to this hour being preached in hell in order to make men believe and be delivered from its pains, as if a Church had been established there as well as on earth.<br>
    16. Those who have inferred from the words, "He preached to the spirits in prison," that Peter held the opinion which perplexes you, seem to me to have been drawn to this interpretation by imagining that the term "spirits" could not be applied to designate souls which were at that time still in the bodies of men, and which, being shut up in the darkness of ignorance, were, so to speak, "in prison," -- a prison such as that from which the Psalmist sought deliverance in the prayer, "Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Thy name;"2 which is in another<br>
<br>
520<br>
<br>
place called the "shadow of death,"1 from which deliverance was granted, not certainly in hell, but in this world, to those of whom it is written, "They that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined."2 But to the men of Noah's time the gospel was preached in vain, because they believed not when God's long suffering waited for them during the many years in which the ark was being built (for the building of the ark was itself in a certain sense a preaching of mercy); even as .now men similar to them are unbelieving, who, to use the same figure, are shut up in the darkness of ignorance as in a prison, beholding in vain the Church which is being built up throughout the world, while judgment is impending, as the flood was by which at that time all the unbelieving perished; for the Lord says: "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man; they did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all."3 But because that transaction was also a type of a future event, that flood was a type both of baptism to believers and of destruction to unbelievers, as in that figure in which, not by a transaction but by words, two things are predicted concerning Christ, when He is represented in Scripture as a stone which was destined to be both to unbelievers a stone of stumbling, and to believers a foundation-stone.4 Occasionally, however, also in the same figure, whether it be in the form of a typical event or of a parable, two things are used to represent one, as believers were represented both by the timbers of which the ark was built and by the eight souls saved in the ark, and as in the gospel similitude of the sheepfold Christ is both the shepherd and the door.5<br>
    Chap. VI.-- 17. And let it not be regarded as an objection to the interpretation now given, that the Apostle Peter says that Christ Himself preached to men shut up in prison who were unbelieving in the days of Noah, as if we must consider this interpretation inconsistent with the fact that at that time Christ had not come. For although he had not. yet come in the flesh, as He came when afterwards He "showed Himself upon earth, and conversed with men,"6 nevertheless he certainly came often to this earth, from the beginning of the human race, whether to rebuke the wicked, as Cain, and before that, Adam and his wife, when they sinned, or to comfort the good, or to admonish both, so that some should to their salvation believe, others should to their condemnation refuse to believe, -- coming then not in the flesh but in the spirit, speaking by suitable manifestations of Himself to such persons and in such manner as seemed good to Him. As to this expression, "He came in the spirit," surely He, as the Son of God, is a Spirit in the essence of His Deity, for that is not corporeal; but what is at any time done by the Son without the Holy Spirit, or without the Father, seeing that all the works of the Trinity are inseparable?<br>
    18. The words of Scripture which are under consideration seem to me of themselves to make this sufficiently plain to those who carefully attend to them: "For Christ hath died once for our sins, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit: in which also He came and preached unto the spirits in prison, who sometime were unbelieving, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing." The order of the words is now, I suppose, carefully noted by you: "Christ being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit;" in which spirit He came and preached also to those spirits who had once in the days of Noah refused to believe His word; since before He came in the flesh to die for us, which He did once, He often came in the spirit, to whom He would, by visions instructing them as He would, coming to them assuredly in the same spirit in which He was quickened when He was put to death in the flesh in His passion. Now what does His being quickened in the spirit mean if not this, that the same flesh in which alone He had experienced death rose from the dead by the quickening spirit?<br>
    Chap. VII. 19. For who will dare to say that Jesus was put to death in His soul, i.e. in the spirit which belonged to Him as man, since the only death which the soul can experience is sin, from which He was absolutely free when for us He was put to death in the flesh? For if the souls of all men are derived from that one which the breath of God gave to the first man, by whom "sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men,"7 either the soul of Christ is not derived from the same source as other souls, because He had absolutely no sin, either original or personal, on account of which death could be supposed to be merited by Him, since He paid on our behalf that which was not on His own account due by Him, in whom the prince of this world, who had the power of death, found nothing8 -- and there is nothing unreasonable in the supposition that<br>
<br>
521<br>
<br>
He who created a soul for the first man should create a soul for Himself; or if the soul of Christ be derived from Adam's soul He in<br>
assuming it to Himself, cleansed it so that when. He came into this world He was born of the Virgin perfectly free from sin either actual or transmitted. If, however, the souls of men are not derived from that one soul, and it is only by the flesh that original sin is transmitted from Adam, the Son of God created a soul for Himself, as He creates souls for all other men, but He united it not to sinful flesh, but to the "likeness of sinful flesh."1 For He took, indeed, from the Virgin the true substance of flesh; not, however, "sinful flesh," for it was neither begotten nor conceived through carnal concupiscence, but mortal, and capable of change in the successive stages of life, as being like unto sinful flesh in all points, sin excepted.<br>
    20. Therefore, whatever be the true theory concerning the origin of souls, -- and on this I feel it would be rash for me to pronounce, meanwhile, any opinion beyond utterly rejecting the theory which affirms that each soul is thrust into the body which it inhabits as into a prison, where it expiates some former actions of its own of which I know nothing, it is certain, regarding the soul of Christ, not only that it is, according to the nature of all souls, immortal, but also that it was neither put to death by sin nor punished by condemnation, the only two ways in which death can be understood as experienced by the soul; and therefore it could not be said of Christ that with reference to the soul He was "quickened in the spirit." For He was quickened in that in which He had been put to death; this, therefore, is spoken with reference to His flesh, for His flesh received life again when the soul returned to it, as it also had died when the soul departed. He was therefore said to be "put to death in the flesh," because He experienced death only in the flesh, but "quickened in the spirit," because by the operation of that Spirit in which He was wont to come and preach to whom He would, that same flesh in which He came to men was quickened and rose from the grave.<br>
    21. Wherefore, passing now to the words which we find farther on concerning unbelievers, "Who shall give account to Him who is ready to judge the quick and the dead," there is no necessity for our understanding the "dead" here to be those who have departed from the body. For it may be that the apostle intended by the word "dead" to denote unbelievers, as being spiritually dead, like those of whom it was said, "Let the dead bury their dead,"2 and by the word "living" to denote those who believe in Him, having not heard in vain the call, "Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light;"3 of whom also the Lord said: "The hour is corning, and now is, when the dead shall hear the  voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall Have."4 On the same principle of interpretation, also, there is nothing compelling us to understand the immediately succeeding words of Peter -- "For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit" as describing what has been done in hell. "For for this cause has the gospel been preached" in this life "to the dead," that is, to the unbelieving wicked, "that" when they believed "they might be judged according to men in the flesh," -- that is, by means of various afflictions and by the death of the body itself; for which reason the same apostle says in another place: "The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God,"6 -- "but live according to God in the spirit," since in that same spirit they had been dead while they were held prisoners in the death of unbelief and wickedness.<br>
	22. If this exposition of the words of Peter offend any one, or, without offending, at least fail to satisfy any one, let him attempt to interpret them on the supposition that they refer to hell: and if he succeed in solving my difficulties which I have mentioned above, so as to remove the perplexity which they occasion, let him communicate his interpretation to me; and if this were done, the words might possibly have been intended to be understood in both ways, but the view which I have propounded is not thereby shown to be false.<br>
   I wrote and sent by the deacon Asellus a letter, which I suppose you have received, giving such answers as I could to the questions which you sent before, excepting the one concerning the vision of God by the bodily senses, on which a larger treatise must be attempted. In your last note, to which this is a reply, you propounded two questions concerning certain words of the Apostle Peter, and concerning the soul of the Lord, both of which I have discussed, -- the former more fully, the latter briefly.7 I beg you not to Fudge the trouble of sending me another copy of the letter containing the question whether it is possible for the substance of the Deity to be seen in a bodily form as limited to place; for it has, I know not how, gone amissing here, and though long sought for, has not been found.<br>

    CHAP. I. -- I. At last I have received your joint letter from Africa, and I do not regret the importunity with which, though you were silent, I persevered in sending letters to you, that I might obtain a reply, and learn, not through report from others, but from your own most welcome statement, that you are in health. I have not forgotten the brief query, or rather the very important theological s question, which you propounded in regard to the origin of the soul, -- does it descend from heaven, as the philosopher Pythagoras and all the Platonists and Origen think? or is it part of the essence of the Deity, as the Stoics, Manichaeus, and the Priscillianists of Spain imagine? or are souls kept in a divine treasure house wherein they were stored of old as some ecclesiastics, foolishly misled, believe? or are they daily created by God and sent into bodies, according to what is written in the gospel, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work"?4 or are souls really produced, as Tertullian, Apollinaris, and the majority of the Western divines conjecture, by propagation, so that as the body is the offspring of body, the soul is the offspring of soul, and exists on conditions similar to those regulating the existence of the inferior animals."5 I know that I have published my opinion on this question in my brief writings against Ruffinus, in reply to a treatise addressed by him to Anastasius, of holy memory, bishop of the Roman: Church, in which, while attempting to impose upon the simplicity of his readers by a slippery and artful, yet withal foolish confession, he exposed to contempt his own faith, or, rather, his own perfidy. These books are, I think, in the possession of your holy kinsman Oceanus, for they were published long ago to meet the calumnies contained in numerous writings of Ruffinus. Be this as it may, you have in Africa that holy man and learned bishop Augustin, who will be able to teach you on this subject viva race, as the saying is, and expound to you his opinion, or, I should rather say, my own opinion stated in his words.<br>
            CHAP. II. -- 2. I have long wished to begin the I volume of Ezekiel, and fulfil a promise frequently made to studious readers; but at the time when I had just begun to dictate the proposed exposition, my mind was so much agitated by the devastation of the western provinces of the empire, and especially by the sack of Rome itself by the barbarians, that, to use a common proverbial phrase, I scarcely knew my own name; and for a long while I was silent, knowing that it was a time for tears. Moreover when I had, in the course of this year, prepared three books of the Commentary, a sudden furious invasion of the barbarous tribes mentioned by your Virgil as "the widely roaming Barcaei,"6 and by sacred Scripture in the words concerning Ishmael, "He shall dwell in the presence of his brethren," swept over the whole of Egypt, Palestine, Phenice, and Syria, carrying all before them with the vehemence of a mighty torrent, so that it was only with the greatest difficulty that we were enabled, by the mercy of Christ, to escape their hands. But if, as a famous orator has said, "Laws are silent amid the clash of arms,"8 how much more may this be said of scriptural studies, which demand a multitude of books and silence, together with uninterrupted diligence of amanuenses, and especially the enjoyment of tranquillity and leisure by those who dictate! I have accordingly sent two books to my holy daughter Fabiola, of which, if you wish copies, you may borrow them from her. Through lack of time I have been unable to transcribe others; when you have read these, and have seen the portico, as it were, you may easily conjecture what the house itself is designed to be. But I trust m the mercy of God, who has helped me in the very difficult commencement of the foresaid work, that He will help me also in the predictions concerning the wars of Gog and Magog, which occupy the last division but one of the prophecy,9 and in the concluding portion itself, describing the building, the details, and the proportions of that most holy and mysterious temple.10<br>
    CHAP. III. -- 3. Our holy brother Oceanus, to whom you desire to be mentioned, is a man of such gifts and character, and so profoundly learned in the law of the Lord, that he may probably give you instruction without any request of mine, and can impart to you on all scriptural questions the opinion which, according to the measure of our joint abilities, we have formed.<br>
    May Christ, our almighty God, keep you, my truly pious lords, in safety and prosperity to a good old age!<br>

                              (A.D. 415.)<br>
              A TREATISE ON THE ORIGIN OF THE HUMAN SOUL,<br>
                         ADDRESSED TO JEROME.1<br>
<br>
    CHAP. I.-- I. Unto our God, who hath called us unto His kingdom and glory,2 I have prayed, and pray now, that what I write to you, holy brother Jerome, asking your opinion in regard to things of which I am ignorant, may by His good pleasure be profitable to us both. For although in addressing you I consult one much older than myself, nevertheless I also am becoming old; but I cannot think that it is at anytime of life too Rate to learn what we need to know, because, although it is more fitting that old men should be teachers than learners, it is nevertheless more fitting for them to learn than to continue ignorant of that which they should teach to others. I assure you that, amid the many disadvantages which I have to submit to in studying very difficult questions, there is none which grieves me more than the circumstance of separation from your Charity by a distance so great that I can scarcely send a letter to you, and scarcely receive one from you, even at intervals, not of days nor of months, but of several years; whereas my desire would be, if it were possible, to have you daily beside me, as one with whom I could converse on any theme. Nevertheless, although I have not been able to do all that I wished, I am not the less bound to do all that I can.<br>
    2. Behold, a religious young man has come to me, by name Orosius, who is in the bond of Catholic peace a brother, in point of age a son, and in honour a fellow presbyter, -- a man, of quick understanding, ready speech, and burning zeal, desiring to be in the Lord's house a vessel rendering useful service in refuting those false and pernicious doctrines, through which the souls of men in Spain have suffered much more grievous wounds than have been inflicted on their bodies by the sword of barbarians. For from the remote western coast of Spain he has come with eager haste to us, having been prompted to do this by the report that from me he could learn whatever he wished on the subjects on which he desired information. Nor has his coming been altogether in vain. In the first place, he has learned not to believe all that report affirmed of me: in the next place, I have taught him all that I could, and, as for the things in which I could not teach him, I have told him from whom he may lean them, and have exhorted him to go on to you. As he received this counsel or rather injunction of mine with pleasure, and with intention to comply with it, I asked him to visit us on his way home to his own country when he comes from you. On receiving his promise to this effect, I believed that the Lord had granted me an opportunity of writing to you regarding certain things which I wish through you to learn. For I was seeking some one whom I might send to you, and it was not easy to fall in with one qualified both by trustworthiness in performing and by alacrity in undertaking the work, as well as by experience in travelling. Therefore, when I became acquainted with this young man, I could not doubt that he was exactly such a person as I was asking from the Lord.<br>
  CHAP. II. -- 3. Allow me, therefore, to bring , before you a subject which I beseech you not to ;refuse to open up and discuss with me. Many are perplexed by questions concerning the soul, . and I confess that I myself am of this number. I shall in this letter, in the first place, state explicitly the things regarding the soul which I most assuredly believe, and shall, in the next , place, bring forward the things regarding which I am still desirous of explanation.<br>
   The soul of man is in a sense proper to itself immortal. It is not absolutely immortal, as God is, of whom it is written that He "alone hath l immortality for Holy Scripture makes mention of deaths to which the soul was able as m the saying, "Let the dead bury their dead;"4 but. because when alienated from the life of God it so dies as not wholly to cease from living in its own nature, it is found to be from a certain cause mortal, yet so as to be not without reason called at the same time immortal. The soul is not a part of God. For if it were,  it would be absolutely immutable and incorruptible, in which case it could neither go downward to be worse, nor go onward to be better; nor  could it either begin to have anything in itself which it had not before, or cease to have any-<br>
<br>
524<br>
<br>
thing which it had within the sphere of its own experience. But how different the actual facts of the case are is a point requiring no evidence from without, it is acknowledged by every one who consults his own consciousness. In vain, moreover, is it pleaded by those who affirm that the soul is a part of God, that the corruption and baseness which we see in the worst of men, and the weakness and blemishes which we see in all men, come to it not from the soul itself, but from the body; for what matters it whence the infirmity originates in that which, if it were indeed immutable, could not, from any quarter whatever, be made infirm? For that which is truly immutable and incorruptible is not liable to mutation or corruption by any influence whatever from without, else the invulnerability which the fable ascribed to the flesh of Achilles would be nothing peculiar to him, but the property of every man, so long as no accident befell him. That which is liable to be changed in any manner, by any cause, or in any part whatever, is therefore not by nature immutable; but it were impiety to think of God as otherwise than truly and supremely immutable: therefore the soul is not a part of God.<br>
    4. That the soul is immaterial is a fact of which I avow myself to be fully persuaded, although men of slow understanding are hard to be convinced that it is so. To secure myself, however, from either unnecessarily causing to others or unreasonably bringing upon myself a controversy about an expression, let me say that, since the thing itself is beyond question, it is needless to contend about mere terms. If matter be used as a term denoting everything which in any form has a separate existence, whether it be called an essence, or a substance, or by another name, the soul is material. Again, if you choose to apply the epithet immaterial only to that nature which is supremely immutable and is everywhere present in its entirety, the soul is material, for it is not at all endowed with such qualities. But if matter be used to designate nothing but that which, whether at rest or in motion, has some length, breadth, and height, so that with a greater part of itself it occupies a greater part of space, and with a smaller part a smaller space, and is in every part of it less than the whole, then the soul is not material. For it pervades the whole body which it animates, not by a local distribution of parts, but by a certain vital influence, being at the same moment present in its entirety in all parts of the body, and not less in smaller parts and greater in larger parts, but here with more energy and there with less energy, it is in its entirety present both in the whole body and in every part of it. For even that which the mind perceives in only a part of the body is nevertheless not otherwise perceived than by the whole mind; for when any part of the living flesh is touched by a fine pointed instrument, although the place affected is not only not the whole body, but scarcely discernible in its surface, the contact does not escape the entire mind, and yet the contact is felt not over the whole body, but only at the one point where it takes place. How comes it, then, that what takes place in only a part of the body is immediately known to the whole mind, unless the whole mind is present at that part, and at the same time not deserting all the other parts of the body in order to be present in its entirety at this one? For all the other parts of the body in which no such contact takes place are still living by the soul being present with them. And ira similar contact takes place in the other parts, and the contact occur in both parts simultaneously, it would in both cases alike be known at the same moment, to the whole mind. Now this presence of the mind in all parts of the body at the same moment, so that in every part of the body the whole mind is at the same moment present, would be impossible if it were distributed over these parts in the same way as we see matter distributed in space, occupying less space with a smaller portion of itself, and greater space with a greater portion. If, therefore, mind is to be called material, it is not material in the same sense as earth, water, air, and ether are material. For all things composed of these elements are larger in larger places, or smaller in smaller places, and none of them is in its entirety present at any part of itself, but the dimensions of the material substances are according to the dimensions of the space occupied. Whence it is perceived that the soul, whether it be termed material or immaterial, has a certain nature of its own, created from a substance superior to the elements of this world, -- a substance which cannot be truly conceived of by any representation of the material images perceived by the bodily senses, but which is apprehended by the understanding and discovered to our consciousness by its living energy. These things I am stating, not with the view of teaching you what you already know, but in order that I may declare explicitly what I hold as indisputably certain concerning the soul, lest any one should think, when I come to state the questions to which I desire answers, that I hold none of the doctrines which we have learned from science or from revelation concerning the soul.<br>
    5. I am, moreover, fully persuaded that the soul has fallen into sin, not through the fault of God, nor through any necessity either in the divine nature or in its own, but by its own free will; and that it can be delivered from the body of this death neither by the strength of its own will, as if that were in itself sufficient to achieve<br>
<br>
525<br>
<br>
this, nor by the death of the body itself, but only by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ ;, and that there is not one soul in the human family to whose salvation the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, is not absolutely necessary. Every soul, moreover, which may at any age whatsoever depart from this life without the grace of the Mediator and the sacrament of this grace, departs to future punishment, and shall receive again its own body at the last judgment as a partner in punishment. But if the soul after its natural generation, which was derived from Adam, be regenerated in Christ, it belongs to His fellowship,2 and shall not only have rest after the death of the body, but also receive again its own body as a partner in glory. These are truths concerning the soul which I hold most firmly.<br>
    Chap. III. -- 6. Permit me now, therefore, to bring before you the question which I desire to have solved, and do not reject me; so may He not reject you who condescended to be rejected for our sakes!<br>
    I ask where can the soul, even of an infant snatched away by death, have contracted the guilt which, unless the grace of Christ has come to the rescue by that sacrament of baptism which is administered even to infants, involves it in condemnation? I know you are not one of those who have begun of late to utter certain new and absurd opinions, alleging that there is no guilt derived from Adam which is removed by baptism in the case of infants. If I knew that you held this view, or, rather, if I did not know that you reject it, I would certainly neither address this question to you, nor think that it ought to be put to you at all. Since, however, we hold on this subject the opinion consonant with the immoveable Catholic faith, which you have yourself expressed when, refuting the absurd sayings of Jovinian, you have quoted this sentence from the book of Job: "In thy sight ,no one is clean, not even the infant, whose time of life on earth is a single day,"3 adding, "for we are held guilty in the similitude of Adam's transgression,"4 an opinion which your book on Jonah's prophecy declares in a notable and lucid manner, where you affirm that the little children of Nineveh were justly compelled to fast along with the people, because merely of their original sin? it is not unsuitable that I should address to you the question where has the soul contracted the guilt from which, even at that age, it must be delivered by the sacrament of Christian grace?<br>
    7. Some years ago, when I wrote certain books concerning Free Will, which have gone forth into the hands of many, and are now in the possession of very many readers, after referring to these four opinions as to the manner of the soul's incarnation, -- (1) that all other souls are derived from the one which was given to the first man; (2) that for each individual a new soul is made; (3) that souls already in existence somewhere are sent by divine act into the bodies; or (4) glide into them of their own accord, I thought that it was necessary to treat them in such a way that, whichever of them tight be true, the decision should not hinder the object which I had in view when contending with all my might against those who attempt to lay upon God the blame of a nature endowed with its own principle of evil, namely, the Manichaeans;6 for at that time I had not heard of the Priscillianists, who utter blasphemies not very dissimilar to these. As to the fifth opinion, namely, that the soul is a part of God, -- an opinion which, in order to omit none, you have mentioned along with the rest in your letter to Marcellinus (a man of pious memory and very dear to us in the grace of Christ), who had consulted you on this question I did not add it to the others for two reasons, first, because, in examining this opinion, we discuss not the incarnation of the soul, but its nature; secondly, because this is the view held by those against whom I was arguing, and the main design of my argument was to prove that the blameless and inviolable nature of the Creator has nothing to do with the faults and blemishes of the creature, while they, on their part, maintained that the substance of the good God itself is, in so far as it is led captive, corrupted and oppressed and brought under a necessity of sinning by the substance of evil, to which they ascribe a proper dominion and principalities. Leaving, therefore, out of the question this heretical error, I desire to know which of the other four opinions we ought to choose. For whichever of them may justly claim our preference, far be it from us to assail this article of :faith, about which we have no uncertainty, that l every soul, even the soul of an infant, requires to be delivered from the binding guilt of sin, and that there is no deliverance except through Jesus i Christ and Him crucified.<br>
    CHAP. IV -- 8. To avoid prolixity, therefore, let me refer to the opinion which you, I believe, entertain, viz. that God even now makes each soul for each individual at the time of birth. To meet the objection to this view which might be taken from the fact that God finished the whole work of creation on the sixth day and rested on the seventh day, you quote the testimony of the<br>
<br>
526<br>
<br>
words in the gospel, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."1 This you have written in your letter to Marcellinus, in which letter, moreover, you have most kindly condescended to mention my name, saying that he had me here in Africa, who could more easily explain to him the opinion held by you.2 But had I been able to do this, he would not have applied for instruction to you, who were so remote from him, though perhaps he did not write from Africa to you. For I know not when he wrote it; I only know that he knew well my hesitation to embrace any definite view on this subject, for which reason he preferred to write to you without consulting me. Yet, even if he had consulted me, I would rather have encouraged him to write to you, and would have expressed my gratitude for the benefit which might have been conferred on us all, had you not preferred to send a brief note, instead of a full reply, doing this, I suppose, to save yourself from unnecessary expenditure of effort in a place where I, whom you supposed to be thoroughly acquainted with the subject of his inquiries, was at hand. Behold, I am willing that the opinion which you hold should be also mine; but I assure you that as yet I have not embraced it.<br>
    9. You have sent to me scholars, to whom you wish me to impart what I have not yet learned myself. Teach me, therefore, what I am to teach them; for many urge me vehemently to be a teacher on this subject, and to them I confess that of this, as well as of many other things, I am ignorant, and perhaps, though they maintain a respectful demeanour in my presence, they say among themselves: "Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?"3 a rebuke which the Lord gave to one who belonged to the class of men who delighted in being called Rabbi; which was also the reason of his coming by night to the true Teacher, because perchance he, who had been accustomed to teach, blushed to take the learner's place. But, for my own part, it gives me much more pleasure to hear instruction from another, than to be myself listened to as a teacher. For I remember what He said to those whom, above all men, He had chosen: "But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your master, even Christ."4 Nor was it any other teacher who taught Moses by Jethro,5 Cornelius by Peter the earlier apostle,6 and Peter himself by Paul the later apostle;7 for by whomsoever truth is spoken, it is spoken by the gift of Him who is the Truth. What if the reason of our still being ignorant of these things, and of our having failed to discover them, even after praying, reading, thinking, and reasoning, be this: that full proof may be made not only of the love with which we give instruction to the ignorant, but also of the humility with which we receive instruction from the learned?<br>
    10. Teach me, therefore, I beseech you, what I may teach to others; teach me what I ought to hold as my own opinion; and tell me this: if souls are from day to day made for each individual separately at birth, where, in the case of infant children, is sin committed by these souls, so that they require the remission of sin in the sacrament of Christ, because of sinning in Adam from whom the sinful flesh has been derived? or if they do not sin, how is it compatible with the justice of the Creator, that, because of their being united to mortal members derived from another, they are so brought under the bond of the sin of that other, that unless they be rescued by the Church, perdition overtakes them, although it is not in their own power to secure that they be rescued by the grace of baptism? Where, therefore, is the justice of the condemnation of so many thousands of souls, which in the deaths of infant children leave this world without the benefit of the Christian sacrament, if being newly created they have, not through any preceding sin of their own, but by the will of the Creator, become severally united to the individual bodies to animate which they were created and bestowed by Him, who certainly knew that every one of them was destined, not through any fault of its own, to leave the body without receiving the baptism of Christ? Seeing, therefore, that we may riot say concerning God either that He compels them to become sinners, or that He punishes innocent souls and seeing that, on the other hand, it is not lawful for us to deny that nothing else than perdition is the doom of the souls, even of little children, which have departed from the body without the sacrament of Christ, tell me, I implore you, where anything can be found to support the opinion that souls are not all derived from that one soul of the first man, but are each created separately for each individual, as Adam's soul was made for him.<br>
    CHAP. V. -- 11. As for some other objections which are advanced against this opinion, I think that I could easily dispose of them. For example, some think that they urge a conclusive argument against this opinion when they ask, how God finished all His works an the sixth day and rested on the seventh day,8 if He is still creating new souls. If we meet them with the quotation from the gospel (given by you in<br>
<br>
527<br>
<br>
the letter to Marcellinus already mentioned), "My Father worketh hitherto," they answer that He "worketh" in maintaining those natures which He has created, not in creating new natures; otherwise, this statement would contradict the words of Scripture in Genesis, where it is most plainly declared that God finished all His works. Moreover, the words of Scripture, that He rested, are unquestionably to be understood of His resting from creating new creatures not from governing those which He had created for at that time He made things which previously did not exist, and from making these He rested because He had finished all the creatures which before they existed He saw necessary to be created, so that thenceforward He did not create and make things which previously did not exist, but made and fashioned out of things already existing whatever He did make. Thus the statements, "He rested from His works," and, "He worketh hitherto," are both true, for the gospel could not contradict Genesis.<br>
    12. When, however, these things are brought forward by persons who advance them as conclusive against the opinion that God now creates new souls as He created the soul of the first man, and who hold either that He forms them from that one soul which existed before He rested from creation, or that He now sends them forth into bodies from some reservoir or storehouse of souls which He then created, it is easy to turn aside their argument by answering, that even in the six days God formed many things out of those natures which He had already created, as, for example, the birds and fishes were formed from the waters, and the trees, the grass, and the animals from the earth, and yet it is undeniable that He was then making things which did not exist before. For there existed previously no bird, no fish, no tree, no animal, and it is clearly understood that He rested from creating those things which previously were not, and were then created, that is to say, He ceased in this sense, that, after that, nothing was made by Him which did not already exist. But if, rejecting the opinions of all who believe either that God sends forth into men souls existing already in some incomprehensible reservoir, or that He makes souls emanate like drops of dew from Himself as particles of His own substance, or that He brings them forth from that one soul of the first man, or that He binds them in the fetters of the bodily members because of sins committed in a prior state of existence, if, I say, rejecting these, we affirm that for each individual He creates separately a new soul when he is born, we do not herein affirm that He makes anything which tie had not already made. For He had already made man after His own image on the sixth day; and this work of His is unquestionably to be understood with reference to the rational soul of man. The same work He still does, not in creating what did not exist, but in multiplying what already existed. Wherefore it is true, on the one hand, that He rested from creating things which previously did not exist, and equally true, on the other hand, that He continues still to work, not only in governing what He has made, but also in making (not anything which did not previously exist, but) a larger number of those creatures which He had already made. Wherefore, either by such an explanation, or by any other which may seem better, we escape from the objection advanced by those who would make the fact that God rested from His works a conclusive argument against our believing that new souls are still being daily created, not from the first soul, but in the same manner as it was made.<br>
    13. Again, as for another objection, stated in the question, "Wherefore does He create souls for those whom He knows to be destined to an early death?" we may reply, that by the death of the children the sins of the parents are either reproved or chastised. We may, moreover, with all propriety, leave these things to the disposal of the Lord of all, for we know that he appoints to the succession of events in time, and therefore to the births and deaths of living creatures as included in these, a course which is consummate in beauty and perfect in the arrangement of all its parts; whereas we are not capable of perceiving those things by the perception of which, if it were attainable, we should be soothed with an ineffable, tranquil joy. For not in vain has the prophet, taught by divine inspiration, declared concerning God, "He bringeth forth in measured harmonies the course of time."1 For which reason music, the science or capacity of i correct harmony, has been given also by the kindness of God to mortals having reasonable souls, with a view to keep them in mind of this great truth. For if a man, when composing a song which is to suit a particular melody, knows how to distribute the length of time allowed to each word so as to make the song flow and pass on in most beautiful adaptation to the ever changeling notes of the melody, how much more shall God, whose wisdom is to be esteemed as infinitely transcending human arts, make infallible provision that not one of the spaces of time alloted to natures that are born and die -- spaces which are like the words and syllables of the successive epochs of the course of time -- shall have, in what we may call the sublime psalm of the vicissitudes of this world, a duration either more brief or more protracted than the fore-<br>
<br>
528<br>
<br>
known and predetermined harmony requires! For when I may speak thus with reference even to the leaves of every tree, and the number of the hairs upon our heads, how much more may I say it regarding the birth and death of men, seeing that every man's life on earth continues for a time, which is neither longer nor shorter than God knows to be in harmony with the plan according to which He rules the universe.<br>
    14. As to the assertion that everything which has begun to exist in time is incapable of immortality, because all things which are born die, and all things which have grown decay through age, and the opinion which they affirm to follow necessarily from this, viz. that the soul of man must owe its immortality to its having been created before time began, this does not disturb my faith; for, passing over other examples, which conclusively dispose of this assertion, I need only refer to the body of Christ, which now "death no more; death shall have no more dominion over it."1<br>
    15. Moreover, as to your remark in your book against Ruffinus, that some bring forward as against this opinion that souls are created for each individual separately at birth the objection that it seems worthy of God that He should give souls to the offspring of adulterers, and who accordingly attempt to build on this a theory that souls may possibly be incarcerated, as it were, in such bodies, to suffer for the deeds of a life spent in some prior state of being,2 -- this objection does not disturb me, as many things by which it may be answered occur to me when I consider it. The answer which you yourself have given, saying, that in the case of stolen wheat, there is no fault in the grain, but only in him who stole it, and that the earth is not under obligation to refuse to cherish the seed because the sower may have cast it in with a hand defiled by dishonesty, is a most felicitous illustration. But even before I had read it, I felt that to me the objection drawn from the offspring of adulterers caused no serious difficulty when I took a general view of the fact that God brings many good things to light, even out of our evils and our sins. Now, the creation of any living creature compels ever), one who considers it with piety and wisdom to give to the Creator praise which words cannot express; and if this praise is called forth by the creation of any living creature whatsoever, how much more is it called forth by the creation of a man! If, therefore, the cause of any act of creative power be sought for, no shorter or better reply can be given than that every creature of God is good. And [so far from such an act being unworthy of God] what is more worthy of Him than that He, being good, should make those good things which, no one else than God alone can make?<br>
    CHAP. VI. -- 16. These things, and others which I can advance, I am accustomed to state, as well as I can, against those who attempt to overthrow by such objections the opinion that souls are made for each individual, as the first man's soul was made for him.<br>
    But when we come to the penal sufferings of infants, I am embarrassed, believe me, by great difficulties, and am wholly at a loss to find an answer by which they are solved; and I speak here not only of those punishments in the life to come, which are involved in that perdition to which they must be drawn down if they depart l from the body without the sacrament of Christian grace, but also of the sufferings which are to our sorrow endured by them before our eyes in this present life, and which are so various, that time rather than examples would fail me if I were to attempt to enumerate them. They are liable to wasting disease, to racking pain, to the agonies of thirst and hunger, to feebleness of limbs, to privation of bodily senses, and to vexing assaults of unclean spirits. Surely it is incumbent on us to show how it is compatible with justice that infants suffer all these things without any evil of their own as the procuring cause. For it would be impious to say, either that these things take place without God's knowledge, or that He cannot resist those who cause them, or that He unrighteously does these things, or permits them to be done. We are warranted in saying that irrational animals are given by God to serve creatures possessing a higher nature, even though they be wicked, as we see most plainly in the gospel that the swine of the Gadarenes were given to the legion of devils at their request; but could we ever be warranted in saying this of men? Certainly not. Man is, indeed, an animal, but an animal endowed with reason, though mortal. In his members dwells a reasonable soul, which in these severe afflictions is enduring a penalty. Now God is good, God is just, God is omnipotent -- none but a madman would doubt that he is so;let the great sufferings, therefore, which infant children experience be accounted for by some reason compatible with justice. When older people suffer such trials, we are accustomed, certainly, to say, either that their worth is being proved, as in Job's case, or that their wickedness is being punished, as in Herod's; and from some examples, which it has pleased God to make perfectly clear, men are enabled to conjecture the nature of others which are more obscure; but this is in regard to persons of mature age. Tell me, therefore, what we must answer in regard to infant children; is it true that, although they<br>
529<br>
<br>
suffer so great punishments, there are no sins in them deserving to be punished? for, of course, there is not in them at that age any righteousness requiring to be put to the proof.<br>
    17. What shall I say, moreover, as to the [difficulty which besets the theory of the creation of each soul separately at the birth of the individual in connection with the] diversity of talent in different souls, and especially the absolute privation of reason in some? This is, indeed, not apparent in the first stages of infancy, but being developed continuously from the beginning of life, it becomes manifest in children, of whom some are so slow and defective in memory that they cannot learn even the letters of the alphabet, and some (commonly called idiots) so imbecile that they differ very little, from the beasts of the field. Perhaps I am told, in answer to this, that the bodies are the cause of these imperfections. But surely the opinion which we wish to see vindicated from objection does not require us to affirm that the soul chose for itself the body which so impairs it, and, being deceived in the choice, committed a blunder; or that the soul, when it was compelled, as a necessary consequence of being born, to enter into some body, was hindered from finding another by crowds of souls occupying the other bodies before it came, so that, like a man who takes whatever seat may remain vacant for him in a theatre, the soul was guided in taking possession of the imperfect body not by its choice, but by its circumstances. We, of course, cannot say and ought not to believe such things. Tell us, therefore, what we ought to believe and to say in order to vindicate from this difficulty the theory that for each individual body a new soul is specially created.<br>
    CHAP. VII. -- 18. In my books on Free Will, already referred to, I have said something, not l in regard to the variety of capacities in different souls, but, at least, in regard to the pains which I infant children suffer in this life. The nature of the opinion which I there expressed, and the reason why it is insufficient for the purposes of our present inquiry, I will now submit to you, and will put into this letter a copy of the passage in the third book to which I refer. It is as follows: -- "In connection with the bodily sufferings experienced by the little children who, by reason of their tender age, have no sins -- if the souls which animate them did not exist before they were born into the human family -- a more grievous and, as it were, compassionate complaint is very commonly made in the remark, 'What evil have they done that they should suffer these things?' as if there could be a meritorious innocence in any one before the time at which it is possible for him to do anything wrong I Moreover, if God accomplishes, in any measure, the correction of the parents when they are chastised by the sufferings or by the death of the children that are dear to them, is there any reason why these things should not take place, seeing that, after they are passed, :they will be, to those who experienced them, as if they had never been, while the persons on whose account they were inflicted will either become better, being moved by the rod of temporal afflictions to choose a better mode of life, or be left without excuse under the punishment awarded at the coming judgment, if, notwithstanding the sorrows of this life, they have refused to turn their desires towards eternal life? Morever, who knows what may be given to the little children by means of whose sufferings the parents have their obdurate hearts subdued, or their faith exercised, or their compassion proved? Who knows what good recompense God may, in the secret of his judgments, reserve for these little ones? For although they have done no righteous action, nevertheless, being free from any transgression of their own, they have suffered these trials. It is certainly not without reason that the Church exalts to the honourable rank of martyrs those children who were slain when Herod sought our Lord Jesus Christ to put Him to death."1<br>
    19. These things I wrote at that time when I was endeavouring to defend the opinion which is now under discussion. For, as I mentioned shortly before, I was labouring to prove that whichever of these four opinions regarding the soul's incarnation may be found true, the substance of the Creator is absolutely free from blame, and is completely removed from all share in our sins. And, therefore, whichever of these opinions might come to be established or demolished by the truth, this had no bearing oft the object aimed at in the work which I was then attempting, seeing that whichever opinion might win the victory over all the rest, after they had been examined in a more thorough discussion, this would take place without causing me any disquietude, because my object then was to prove that, even admitting all these opinions, the doctrine maintained by me remained unshaken. But now my object is, by the force of sound reasoning, to select, if possible, one opinion out of the four; and, therefore, when I carefully consider the words now quoted from that book, I do not see that the arguments there used in defending the opinion which we are now discussing are valid and conclusive.<br>
    20. For what may be called the chief prop of my defence is in the sentence, "Moreover, who knows what may be given to the little children, by means of whose sufferings the parents have<br>
<br>
530<br>
<br>
their obdurate hearts subdued, or their faith exercised, or their compassion proved? Who knows what good recompense God may, in the secret of His judgments, reserve for these little ones?" I see that this is not an unwarranted conjecture in the case of infants who, in any way, suffer (though they know it not) for the sake of Christ and in the cause of true religion, and of infants who have already been made partakers of the sacrament of Christ; because, apart from union to the one Mediator, they cannot be delivered from condemnation, and so put in a position in which it is even possible that a recompense could be made to them for the evils which, in diverse afflictions, they have endured in this world. But since the question cannot be fully solved, unless the answer include also the case of those who, without having received the sacrament of Christian fellowship, die in infancy after enduring the most painful sufferings, what recompense can be conceived of in their case, seeing that, besides all that they suffer in this life, perdition awaits them in the life to come? As to the baptism of infants, I have, in the same book, given an answer, not, indeed, fully, but so far as seemed necessary for the work which then occupied me, proving that it profits children, even though they do not know what it is, and have, as yet, no faith of their own; but on the subject of the perdition of those infants who depart from this life without baptism, I did not think it necessary to say anything then, because the question under discussion was different from that with which we are now engaged.<br>
    21. If, however, we pass over and make no account of those sufferings which are of brief continuance, and which, when endured, are not to be repeated, we certainly cannot, in like manner, make no account of the fact that "by one man death came, and by one man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."1 For, according to this apostolical, divine, and perspicuous declaration, it is sufficiently plain that no one goes to death otherwise than through Adam, and that no one goes to life eternal otherwise; than through Christ. For this is the force of all in the two parts of the sentence; as all men, by their first, that is, their natural birth, belong to Adam, even so all men, whoever they be, who come to Christ come to the second, that is, the spiritual birth. For this reason, therefore, the word all is used in both clauses, because as all who die do not die otherwise than in Adam, so all who shall be made alive shall not be made alive otherwise than in Christ. Wherefore whosoever tells us that any man can be made alive in the resurrection of the dead otherwise than in Christ, he is to be detested as a pestilent enemy to the common faith. Likewise, whosoever says that those children who depart out of this life without partaking of that sacrament shall be made alive in Christ, certainly contradicts the apostolic declaration, and condemns the universal Church, in which it is the practice to lose i no time and run in haste to administer baptism to infant children, because it is believed, as an i indubitable truth, that otherwise they cannot be made alive in Christ. Now he that is not made alive in Christ must necessarily remain under the condemnation, of which the apostle says, that "by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation."2 That infants are born under the guilt of this offence is believed by the whole Church. It is also a doctrine which you have most faithfully set forth, both in your treatise against Jovinian and your exposition of Jonah, as I mentioned above, and, if I am not mistaken, in other parts of your works which I have not read or have at present forgotten. I therefore ask, what is the ground of this condemnation of unbaptized infants ? For if new souls are made for men, individually, at their birth, I do not see, on the one hand, that they could have any sin while yet in infancy, nor do I believe, on the other hand, that God condemns any soul which He sees to have no sin.<br>
    CHAP. VIII. -- 22. Are we perchance to say, in answer to this, that in the infant the body alone is the cause of sin; but that for each body a new soul is made, and that if this soul live according to the precepts of God, by the help of the grace of Christ, the reward of being made incorruptible may be secured for the body itself, when subdued and kept under the yoke; and that inasmuch as the soul of an infant cannot yet do this, unless it receive the sacrament of Christ, that which could not yet be obtained for the body by the holiness of the soul is obtained for it by the grace of this sacrament; but if the soul of an infant depart without the sacrament, it shall itself dwell in life eternal, from which it could not be separated, as it had no sin, while, however, the body which it occupied shall not rise again in Christ, because the sacrament had not been received before its death?<br>
    23. This opinion I have never heard or read anywhere. I have, however, certainly heard and believed the statement which led me to speak thus, namely, "The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life," -- the resurrection, namely, of which it is said that "by one man came the resurrection of the dead," and in which "all shall be made alive in Christ," -- "and they<br>
<br>
531<br>
<br>
that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."1 Now, what is to be understood regarding infants which, before they could do good or evil, have quitted the body without baptism? Nothing is said here concerning them. But if the bodies of these infants shall not rise again, because they, have never done either good or evil, the bodies of the infants that have died after receiving the grace of baptism shall also: have no resurrection, because they also were not: in this life able to do good or evil. If, however,. these are to rise among the saints, i.e. among: those who have done good, among whom shall the others rise again but among those who have done evil -- unless we are to believe that some human souls shall not receive, either in the resurrection of life, or in the resurrection of damnation, the bodies which they lost in death? This opinion, however, is condemned, even before it is formally refuted, by its absolute novelty; and besides this, who could bear to think that those who run with their infant children to have them baptized, are prompted to do so by a regard for their bodies, not for their souls? The blessed Cyprian, indeed, said, in order to correct those who thought that an infant should not be baptized before the eighth day, that it was not the body but the soul which behoved to be saved from perdition -- in which statement he was not inventing any new doctrine, but preserving the firmly established faith of the Church; and he, along with some of his colleagues in the episcopal office, held that a child may be properly baptized immediately after its birth.2<br>
    24. Let every man, however, believe anything which commends itself to his own judgment, even though it run counter to some opinion of Cyprian, who may not have seen in the matter! what should have been seen. But let no man believe anything which runs counter to the perfectly unambiguous apostolical declaration, that by the offence of one all are brought into condemnation, and that from this condemnation nothing sets men free but the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom alone life is given to all who are made alive. And let no man believe anything which runs counter to the firmly grounded practice of the Church, in which, if the sole reason for hastening the administration of baptism were to save the children, the dead as well as the living would be brought to be baptized.<br>
    25. These things being so, it is necessary still to investigate and to make known the reason! why, if souls are created new for every individual at his birth, those who die in infancy without the sacrament of Christ are doomed to perdition; for that they are doomed to this if they so depart from the body is testified both by Holy Scripture and by the holy Church. Wherefore, as to that opinion of yours concerning the creation of new souls, if it does not contradict this firmly grounded article of faith, let it be mine also; but if it does, let it be no longer yours.<br>
    26. Let it not be said to me that we ought to receive as supporting this opinion the words of Scripture in Zechariah, "He formeth the spirit of man within him,"3 and in the book of Psalms, "He formeth their hearts severally."4 We must seek for the strongest and most indisputable proof, that we may not be compelled to believe that God is a judge who condemns any soul which has no fault. For to create signifies either as much or, probably, more than to form [fingere]; nevertheless it is written, "Create in me a clean heart, O God,"5 and yet it cannot be supposed that a soul here expresses a desire to be made before it has begun to exist. Therefore, as it is a soul already existing which is created by being renewed in righteousness, so it is a soul already existing which is formed by the moulding power of doctrine. Nor is ),our opinion, which I would willingly make my own, supported by that sentence in Ecclesiastes, "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it."6 Nay, it rather favours those who think that all souls are derived from one; for they say that, as the dust returns to the earth as it was, and yet the body of which this is said returns not to the man from whom it was derived, but to the earth from which the first man was made, the spirit in like manner, though derived from the spirit of the first man, does not return to him but to the Lord, by whom it was given to our first parent. Since, however, the testimony of this passage in their favour is not so decisive as to make it appear altogether opposed to the opinion which shall gladly see vindicated, I thought proper to submit these remarks on it to your judgment, to prevent you from endeavouring to deliver me from my perplexities by quoting passages such as these. For although no man's wishes can make that true which is not true, nevertheless, were this possible, I would wish that this opinion should be true, as I do wish that, if it is true, it should be most clearly and unanswerably vindicated by you.<br>
    CHAP. IX. -- 27. The same difficulty attends those also who hold that souls already existing elsewhere, and prepared from the beginning of the works of God, are sent by Him into bodies. For to these persons also the same question may<br>
<br>
532<br>
<br>
be put: If these souls, being without any fault, go obediently to the bodies to which they are sent, why are they subjected to punishment in the case of infants, if they come without being baptized to the end of this life ? The same difficulty unquestionably attaches to both opinions. Those who affirm that each soul is, according to the deserts of its actions in an earlier state of being, united to the body alloted to it in this life, imagine that they escape more easily from this difficulty. For they think that to "die in Adam" means to suffer punishment in that flesh which is derived from Adam, from which condition of guilt the grace of Christ, they say, delivers the young as well as the old. So far, indeed, they teach what is right, and true, and excellent, when they say that the grace of Christ delivers the young as well as the old from the guilt of sins. But that souls sin in another earlier life, and that for their sins in that state of being they are cast down into bodies as prisons, I do not believe: I reject and protest against such an opinion. I do this, in the first place, because they affirm that this is accomplished by means of some incomprehensible revolutions, so that after I know not how many cycles the soul must return again to the same burden of corruptible flesh and to the endurance of punishment, -- than which opinion I do not know that anything more horrible could be conceived. In the next place, who is the righteous man gone from the earth about whom we should not (if what they say is true) feel afraid lest, sinning in Abraham's bosom, he should be cast down into the flames which tormented the rich man in the parable?1 For why may the soul not sin after leaving the body, if it can sin before entering it ? Finally, to have sinned in Adam (in regard to which the apostle says that in him all have sinned) is one thing, but it is a wholly different thing to have sinned, I know not where, outside of Adam, and then because of this to be thrust into Adam -- that is, into the body, which is derived from Adam, as into a prison-house. As to the other opinion mentioned above, that all souls are derived from one, I will not begin to discuss it unless I am under necessity to do so; and my desire is, that if the opinion which we are now discussing is true, it may be so vindicated by you that there shall be no longer any necessity for examining the other.<br>
    28. Although, however, I desire and ask, and with fervent prayers wish and hope, that by you the Lord may remove my ignorance on this subject, if, after all, I am found unworthy to obtain this, I will beg the grace of patience from the Lord our God, in whom we have such faith, that even if there be some things which He does not open to us when we knock, we know it would be wrong to murmur in the least against Him.<br>
remember what He said to the apostles themselves: "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now."2 Among these things, so far at least as I am concerned, let me still reckon this, and let me guard against being angry that I am deemed unworthy to possess this knowledge, lest by such anger I be all the more clearly proved to be unworthy. I am equally ignorant of many other things, yea, of more than I could name or even number; and of this I would be more patiently ignorant, were it not that I fear lest some one of these opinions, involving the contradiction of truth which we most assuredly believe, should insinuate itself into the minds of the unwary. Meanwhile, though I do not yet know which of these opinions is to be preferred, this one thing I profess as my deliberate conviction, that the opinion which is true does not conflict with that most firm and well grounded article in the faith of :he Church of Christ, that infant children, even when they are newly born, can be delivered from perdition in no other way than through the grace of Christ's name, which He has given in His sacraments.<br>
<br>
                      LETTER CLXVII. (A.D. 415.)<br>
               FROM AUGUSTIN TO JEROME ON JAMES II. 10.<br>
<br>
    CHAP. I. -- I. My brother Jerome, esteemed worthy to be honoured in Christ by me, when I wrote to you propounding this question concerning the human soul, -- if a new soul be now created for each individual at birth, whence do souls contract the bond of guilt which we assuredly believe to be removed by the sacrament of the grace of Christ, when administered even to new-born children? -- as the letter on that subject grew to the size of a considerable volume, I was unwilling to impose the burden of any other question at that time; but there is a subject which has a much stronger claim on my attention, as it presses more seriously on my mind. I therefore ask you, and in God's name beseech you, to do something which will, I believe, be of great service to many, namely, to explain to me (or to direct me to any work in which you or any other commentator has already expounded) the sense in which we are to understand these words in the Epistle of James, "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."3 This subject is of such importance that I very greatly<br>
<br>
533<br>
<br>
regret that I did not write to you in regard to it long ago.<br>
    2. For whereas in the question which I thought it neccessary to submit to you concerning the soul, our inquiries were engaged with the investigation of a life wholly past and sunk out of sight in oblivion, in this question we study this present life, and how it must be spent if we would attain to eternal life. As an apt illustration of this remark let me quote an entertaining anecdote. A man had fallen into a well where the quantity of water was sufficient to break his fall and save him from death, but not deep enough to cover his mouth and deprive him of speech. Another man approached, and on seeing him cries out in surprise: "How did you fall in here?" He answers: "I beseech you to plan how you can get me out of this, rather than ask how I fell in." So, since we admit and hold as an article of the Catholic faith, that the soul of even a little infant requires to be delivered out of the guilt of sin, as out of a pit, by the grace of Christ, it is sufficient for the soul of such a one that we know the way in which it is saved, even though we should never know the way in which it came into that wretched condition. But I thought it our duty to inquire into this subject, lest we should incautiously hold any one of those opinions concerning the manner of the soul's becoming united with the body which might contradict the doctrine that the souls of little children require to be delivered, by denying that they are subject to the bond of guilt. This, then, being very firmly held by us, that the soul of every infant needs to be freed from the guilt of sin, and can be freed in no other way except by the grace of. God through Jesus Christ our Lord, if we can ascertain the cause and origin of the evil itself, we are better prepared and equipped for resisting adversaries whose empty talk I call not reasoning but quibbling; if, however, we cannot: ascertain the cause, the fact that the origin of, this misery is hid from us is no reason for our being slothful in the work which compassion demands from us. In our conflict, however, with those who appear to themselves to know what they do not know, we have an additional strength and safety in not being ignorant of our ignorance on this subject. For there are some things which it is evil not to know; there are other things which cannot be known, or are not necessary to be known, or have no bearing on the life which we seek to obtain; but the question which I now submit to you from the writings of the Apostle James is intimately connected with the course of conduct in which we live, and in which, with a view to life eternal, we endeavour to please God.<br>
    3. How, then, I beseech you, are we to understand the words: "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all"? Does this affirm that the person who shall have committed theft, nay, who even shall have said to the rich man, "Sit thou here" and to the poor man, "Stand thou there," is guilty of homicide, and adultery, and sacrilege ? And if he is not so, how can it be said that a person who has offended in one point has become guilty of all? Or are the things which the apostle said concerning the rich man and the poor man not to be reckoned among those things in one of which if any man offend he becomes guilty of all ? But we must remember whence I that sentence is taken, and what goes before it, and in what connection it occurs. "My brethren," he says, "have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory, with respect of persons. For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool; are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts ? Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him ? But ye have despised the poor,"1 -- inasmuch as you have said to the poor man, "Stand thou there," when you would have said to a man with a gold ring, "Sit thou here in a good place." And then there follows a passage explaining and enlarging upon that same conclusion: "Do not rich men oppress you by their power, and draw you before the judgment-seats? Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? If ye fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors." See how the apostle calls those transgressors of the law who say to the rich man, "Sit here," and to the poor, "Stand there." See how, lest they should think it a trifling sin to transgress the law in this one thing, he goes on to add: "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty Of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou do not kill, yet, if thou commit adultery, thou art become a transgressor of the law," according to that which he had said: "Ye are convinced of the law as transgressors." Since these things are so, it seems to follow, unless it can be shown that we are to understand it in some other way,<br>
<br>
534<br>
<br>
that he who says to the rich man, "Sit here," and to the poor, "Stand there," not treating the one with the same respect as the other, is to be judged guilty as an idolater, and a blasphemer, and an adulterer, and a murderer -- in short, -- not to enumerate all, which would be tedious, -- as guilty of all crimes, since, offending in one, he is guilt), of all."<br>
    CHAP. II. -- 4. But has he who has one virtue all virtues? and has he no virtues who lacks one? If this be true, the sentence of the apostle is thereby confirmed. But what I desire is to have the sentence explained, not confirmed, since of itself it stands more sure in our esteem than all the authority of philosophers could make it. And even if what has just been said concerning virtues and vices were true, it would not follow that therefore all sins are equal. For as to the inseparable co-existence of the virtues, this is a doctrine in regard to which, if I remember rightly, what, indeed, I have almost forgotten (though perhaps I am mistaken), all philosophers who affirm that virtues are essential to the right conduct of life are agreed. The doctrine of the equality of sins, however, the Stoics alone dared to maintain in opposition to the unanimous sentiments of mankind: an absurd tenet, which in writing against Jovinianus (a Stoic in this opinion, but an Epicurean in following after and defending pleasure) you have most clearly refuted from the Holy Scriptures.1 In that most delightful and noble dissertation you have made it abundantly plain that it has not been the doctrine of our authors, or rather of the Truth Himself, who has spoken through them, that all sins are equal. I shall now do my utmost in endeavouring, with the help of God, to show how it can be that, although the doctrine of philosophers concerning virtues is true, we are nevertheless not compelled to admit the Stoics' doctrine that all sins are equal. If I succeed, I will look for your approbation, and in whatever respect I come short, I beg you to supply my deficiencies.<br>
	   5. Those who maintain that he who has one virtue has all, and that he who lacks one lacks] all, reason correctly from the fact that prudence cannot be cowardly, nor unjust, nor intemperate; for if it were any of these it would no longer be prudence. Moreover, if it be prudence only when it is brave, and just, and temperate, assuredly wherever it exists it must have the other virtues along with it. In like manner, also, courage cannot be imprudent, or intemperate, or unjust; temperance must of necessity be prudent, brave, and just; and justice does not exist unless it be prudent, brave, and temperate. Thus, wherever any one of these virtues truly exists, the others likewise exist; and where some are absent, that which may appear in some measure to resemble virtue is not really present.<br>
    6. There are, as you know, some vices opposed to virtues by a palpable contrast, as imprudence is the opposite of prudence. But there are some vices opposed to virtues simply because they are vices which, nevertheless, by a deceitful appearance resemble virtues; as, for example, in the relation, not of imprudence, but of craftiness to the said virtue of prudence. I speak here of that craftiness 2 which is wont to be understood and spoken of in connection with the evilly disposed, not in the sense in which the word is usually employed in our Scriptures, where it is often used in a good sense, as, "Be crafty as serpents,"3 and again, to give craftiness to the simple."4 It is true that among heathen writers one of the most accomplished of Latin authors, speaking of Catiline, has said: "Nor was there lacking on his part craftiness to guard against danger,"5 using "craftiness" (astutia) in a good sense; but the use of the word in this sense is among them very rare, among us very common. So also in regard to the virtues classed under temperance. Extravagance is most manifestly opposite to the virtue of frugality; but that which the common people are . wont to call niggardliness is indeed a vice, yet one which, not in its nature, but by a very deceitful similarity of appearance, usurps the name of frugality. In the same manner injustice is by , a palpable contrast opposed to justice; but the desire of avenging oneself is wont often to be a counterfeit of justice, but it is a vice. There is an obvious contrariety between courage and cowardice; but hardihood, though differing from courage in nature, deceives us by its resemblance to that virtue. Firmness is a part of virtue; fickleness is a vice far removed from and undoubtedly opposed to it; but obstinacy lays claim to the name of firmness, yet is wholly different, because firmness is a virtue, and obstinacy is a vice.<br>
    7. To avoid the necessity of again going over the same ground, let us take one case as an example, from which all others may be understood. Catiline, as those who have written concerning him had means of knowing, was capable of enduring cold, thirst, hunger, and patient in fastings, cold, and watchings beyond what any one could believe, and thus he appeared, both to himself and to his followers, a man endowed , with great courage.6 But this courage was not prudent, for he chose the evil instead of the<br>
<br>
535<br>
<br>
good; was not temperate, for his life was disgraced by the lowest dissipation; was not just, for he conspired against his country; and therefore it was not courage, but hardihood usurping the name of courage to deceive fools; for if it had been courage, it would not have been a vice but a virtue, and if it had been a virtue, it would never have been abandoned by fie other virtues, its inseparable companions.<br>
    8. On this account, when it is asked also concerning vices, whether where one exists all in like manner exist, or where one does not exist none exist, it would be a difficult matter to show this, because two vices are wont to be opposed to one virtue, one that is evidently opposed, and another that bears an apparent likeness. Hence the hardihood of Catiline is the more easily seen not to have been courage, since it had not along with it other virtues; but it may be difficult to convince men that his hardihood was cowardice, since he was in the habit of enduring and patiently submitting to the severest hardships to a degree almost incredible. But perhaps, on examining the matter more closely, this hardihood itself is seen to be cowardice, because he shrunk from the toil of those liberal studies by which true courage is acquired. Nevertheless, as there are rash men who are not guilty of cowardice, and there are cowardly men who are not guilty of rashness, and since.in both there is vice, for the truly brave man neither ventures rashly nor fears without reason, we are forced to admit that vices are more numerous than virtues.<br>
    9. Accordingly, it happens sometimes that one vice is supplanted by another, as the love of money by the love of praise. Occasionally, one vice quits the field that more may take its place, as in the case of the drunkard, who, after becoming temperate m the use of drink, may come under the power of niggardliness and ambition. It is possible, therefore, that vices may give place to vices, not to virtues, as their successors, and thus they are more numerous. When one virtue, however, has entered, there will infallibly be (since it brings all the other virtues along with it) a retreat of all vices whatsoever that were in the man; for all vices were not in him, but at one time so many, at another a greater or smaller number might occupy their place.<br>
    CHAP. III. -- 10. We must inquire more carefully whether these things are so; for the statement that "he who has one virtue has all, and that all virtues are awanting to him who lacks one," is not given by inspiration, but is the view held by many men, ingenious, indeed, and studious, but still men. But I must avow that, in the case -- I shall not say of one of those from whose name the word virtue is said to be derived,1 but even of a woman who is faithful to her husband, and who is so from a regard to the commandments and promises of God, and, first of all, is faithful to Him, I do not know how I could say of her that she is unchaste, or that chastity is no virtue or a trifling one. I should feel the same in regard to a husband who is faithful to his wife; and yet there are many such, none of whom I could affirm to be without any sins, and doubtless the sin which is in them, whatever it be, proceeds from some Vice. Whence it follows that though conjugal fidelity in religious men and women is undoubtedly a virtue, for it is neither a nonentity nor a vice, yet it does not bring along with it all virtues, for if all virtues were there, there would be no vice, and if there were no vice, there would be no sin; but where is the man who is altogether without sin ? Where, therefore, is the man who is without any vice, that is, fuel or root, as it were, of sin, when he who reclined on the breast of the Lord says, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us"?2 It is not necessary for us to urge this at greater length in writing to you, but I make the statement for the sake of others who perhaps shall read this. For you, indeed, in that same splendid work against Jovinianus, have carefully proved this from the Holy Scriptures; in which work also you have quoted the words, "in many things we all offend,"3 from this very epistle in which occur the words whose meaning we are now investigating. For though it is an apostle of Christ who is speaking, he does not say, "ye offend," but, "we offend;" and although in the passage under consideration he says, "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all," 4 in the words just quoted he affirms that we offend not in one i thing but in many, and not that some offend but that we all offend.<br>
    11. Far be it, however, from any believer to think that so many thousands of the servants of Christ, who, lest they should deceive themselves, and the truth should not be in them, sincerely confess themselves to have sin, are altogether without virtues For wisdom is a great virtue, and wisdom herself has said to man, "Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom."5 Far be it from us, then, to say that so many and so great believing and pious men have not the fear of the Lord, which the Greeks call &lt;greek>eusebeia&lt;/greek>, or more literally and fully, &lt;greek>qeosebeia&lt;/greek> And what is the fear of the Lord but His worship ? and whence is He truly worshipped except from love? Love, then, out of a pure heart, and a<br>
<br>
536<br>
<br>
good conscience, and faith unfeigned, is the great and true virtue, because it is "the end of the commandment."1 Deservedly is love said to be "strong as death,"2 because, like death, it is vanquished by none; or because the measure of love in this life is even unto death, as the Lord says, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends;"3 or, rather, because, as death forcibly separates the soul from the senses of the body, so love separates it from fleshly lusts. Knowledge, when it is of the right kind, is the handmaid to love, for without love "knowledge puffeth up,"4 but where love, by edifying, has filled the heart, there knowledge will find nothing empty i which it can puff up. Moreover, Job has shown, what is that useful knowledge by defining it where, after saying, "The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom" he adds "and to depart from evil, I that is understanding."5 Why do we not then say that the man who has this virtue has all virtues, since "love is the fulfilling of the law?"6. Is it not true that, the more love exists in a man the more he is endowed with virtue, and the less love he has the less virtue is in him, for love is itself virtue; and the less virtue there is in a man so much the more vice will there be in him ?: Therefore, where love is full and perfect, no vice will remain.<br>
    12. The Stoics, therefore, appear to me to be mistaken in refusing to admit that a man who is advancing in wisdom has any wisdom at all, and in affirming that he alone has it who has become altogether perfect in wisdom. They do not, ! indeed, deny that he has made progress, but they say that he is in no degree entitled to be called wise, unless, by emerging, so to speak, from the depths, he suddenly springs forth into the free air of wisdom. For, as it matters not when a man is drowning whether the depth of water above him be many stadia or only the breadth of a hand or finger, so they say in regard to the progress of those who are advancing towards wisdom, that they are like men rising from the bottom of a whirlpool towards the air, but that unless they by their progress, so escape as to emerge wholly from folly as from an overwhelming flood, they have not virtue and are not wise; but that, when they have so escaped, they immediately have wisdom in perfection, and not a vestige of folly whence any sin could be originated remains.<br>
    12. This simile, in which folly is compared to water and wisdom to air, so that the mind emerging, as it were, from the stifling influence of folly breathes suddenly the free air of wisdom, does not appear to me to harmonize sufficiently with the authoritative statement of our Scriptures; a better simile, so far, at least, as illustration of spiritual things can be borrowed from material things, is that which compares vice or folly to darkness, and virtue or wisdom to light. The way to wisdom is therefore not like that of a man rising from the water into the air, in which, in the moment of rising above the surface of the water, he suddenly breathes freely, but, like that of a man proceeding from darkness into light, on whom more light gradually shines as he advances. So long, therefore, as this is not fully accomplished, we speak of the man as of one going from the dark recesses of a vast cavern towards its entrance, who is more and more influenced by the proximity of the light as he comes nearer to the entrance of the cavern; so that whatever light he has proceeds from the light to which he is advancing, and whatever darkness still remains in him proceeds from the darkness out of which he is emerging. Therefore it is true that in the sight of God "shall no man living be justified,"7 and yet that "the just shall live by his faith."8 On the one hand, "the saints are clothed with righteousness,"9 one more, another less; on the other hand, no one lives here wholly without sin -- one sins more, another less, and the best is the man who sins least.<br>
    CHAP. IV. -- 14. But why have I, as if forgetting to whom I address myself, assumed the tone of a teacher in stating the question regarding which I wish to be instructed by you ? Nevertheless, as I had resolved to submit to your examination my opinion regarding the equality of sins (a subject involving a question closely bearing on the matter on which I was writing), let me now at last bring my statement to a conclusion. Even though it were true that he who has one virtue has all virtues, and that he who lacks one virtue has none, this would not involve the consequence that all sins are equal; for although it is true that where there is no virtue there is nothing right, it by no means follows that among bad actions one cannot be worse than another, or that divergence from that which is right does not admit of degrees. I think, however, that it is more agreeable to truth and consistent with the Holy Scriptures to say, that what is true of the members of the body is true i of the different dispositions of the soul (which, though not seen occupying different places, are by their distinctive workings perceived as plainly as the members of the body), namely, that as in the same body one member is more fully<br>
<br>
537<br>
<br>
shone upon by the light, another is less shone upon, and a third is altogether without light, and remains in the dark under some impervious covering, something similar takes place in regard to the various dispositions of the soul. If this be so, then according to the manner in which every man is shone upon by the light of holy love, he may be said to have one virtue and to lack another virtue, or to have one virtue in larger and another in smaller measure. For in reference to that love which is the fear of God, we may correctly say both that it is greater in one man than in another, and tim there is some of it in one man, and none of it in another; we may also correctly say as to an individual that he has greater chastity than patience, and that he has either virtue in a higher degree than he had yesterday, if he is making progress, or tim he still lacks self-control, but possesses, at the same time, a large measure of compassion.<br>
    15. To sum up generally and briefly the view which, so far as relates to holy living, I entertain concerning virtue, -- virtue is tile love with which that which ought to be loved is loved. This is in some greater, in others less, and there are men in whom it does not exist at all; but in the absolute fulness which admits of no increase, it exists in no man while living on this earth; so long, however, as it admits of being increased there can be no doubt that, in so far as it is less than it ought to be, the shortcoming proceeds from vice. Because of this vice there is "not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not;"1 because of this vice, "in God's sight shall no man living be justified."2 On account of this vice, "if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."3 On account of this also, whatever progress we may have made, we must say, "Forgive us our debts,"4 although all debts in word, deed, and thought were washed away in baptism. He, then, who sees aright, sees whence, and when, and where he must hope for that perfection to which nothing can be added. Moreover, if there had been no commandments, there would have been no means whereby a man might certainly examine himself and see from what things he ought to turn aside, whither he should aspire, and in what things he should find occasion for thanksgiving or for prayer. Great, therefore, is the benefit of commandments, if to free will so much liberty be granted that the grace of God may be more abundantly honoured.<br>
    CHAP. V. -- 16. If these things be so, how shall a man who shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, be guilty of all ? May it not be, that since the fulfilling of the law is that love wherewith we love God and our neighbour, on which commandments of love "hang all the law and the prophets,"5 he is justly held to be guilty of all who violates that on which all hang? Now, no one sins without violating this love; "for this, thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shall do no murder; thou shall not steal; thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."6 No one, however, loves his neighbour who does not out of his love to God do all in his power to bring his neighbour also, whom he loves as himself, to love God, whom if he does not love, he neither loves himself nor his neighbour. Hence it is true that if a man shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he becomes guilty of all, because he does what is contrary to the love on which hangs the whole law. A man, therefore, becomes guilty of all by doing what is contrary to that on which all hang.<br>
    17. Why, then, may not all sins be said to be equal ? May not the reason be, that the transgression of the law of love is greater in him who commits a more grievous sin, and is less in him who commits a less grievous sin? And in the mere fact of his committing any sin whatever, he becomes guilty of all; but in committing a more grievous sin, or in sinning in more respects than one, he becomes more guilty; committing a less grievous sin, or sinning in fewer respects, he becomes less guilty, -- his guilt being thus so much the greater the more he has sinned, the less the less he has sinned. Nevertheless, even though it be only in one point that he offend, he is guilty of all, because he violates that love on which all hang. If these things be true, an explanation is by this means found, clearing up that saying of the man of apostolic grace, "In many things we offend all."7 For we all offend, but one more grievously, another more slightly, according as each may have committed a more grievous or a less grievous sin .; every one being great in the practice of sin in proportion as he is deficient in loving God and his neighbour, and, on the other hand, decreasing in the practice of sin in proportion as he increases in the ;love of God and of his neighbour. The more, therefore, that a man is deficient in love, the more is he full of sin. And perfection in love i is reached when nothing of sinful infirmity remains in us.<br>
    18. Nor, indeed, in my opinion, are we to esteem it a trifling sin "to have the faith of our<br>
<br>
538<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons," if we take the difference between sitting and standing, of which mention is made in the context, to refer to ecclesiastical honours; for who can bear to see a rich man chosen to a place of honour in the Church, while a poor man, of superior qualifications and of greater holiness. is despised? If, however, the apostle speaks there of our daily assemblies, who does not offend in the matter? At the same time, only those really offend here who cherish in their hearts the opinion that a man's worth is to be estimated according to his wealth; for this seems to be the meaning of the expression, "Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"<br>
    19. The law of liberty, therefore, the law of love, is that of which he says: "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.1 And then (after the difficult sentence, "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all," concerning which I have with sufficient fulness stated my opinion), making mention of the same law of liberty, he says: "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." And as he knew by experience what he had said a little before, "in many things we offend all," he suggests a sovereign remedy, to be applied, as it l were day by day, to those less serious but real] wounds which the soul suffers day by day, for he says: "He shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy."2 For with the same purpose the Lord says: "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: give, and it shall be given unto you."3 After which the apostle says: "But mercy rejoiceth over judgment: it's not said that mercy prevails over judgment, for it is not an adversary of judgment, but it "rejoiceth" over judgment, because a greater number are gathered in by mercy; but they are those who have shown mercy, for, "Blessed are the merciful, for God shall have mercy on them."4<br>
    20. It is, therefore, by all means just that they be forgiven, because they have forgiven others, and that what they need be given to them, because they have given to others. For God uses mercy when He judgeth, and uses judgment when He showeth mercy. Hence the Psalmist says: "I will sing of mercy and of judgment unto Thee, O Lord."5 For if any man, thinking himself too righteous to require mercy, presumes, as if he had no reason for anxiety, to wait for judgment without mercy, he provokes that most righteous indignation through fear of which the Psalmist said: "Enter not into judgment with Thy servant."6 For this reason the Lord says to a disobedient people: "Wherefore will ye contend with me in judgment? 7 For when the righteous King shall sit upon His throne, who shall boast that he has a pure heart, or who shall boast that he is clean from sin ? What hope is there then unless mercy shall "rejoice over" judgment? But this it will do only in the case of those who have showed mercy, saying with sincerity, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors," and who have given without murmuring, for "the Lord loveth a cheerful giver."8 To conclude, St. James is led to speak thus concerning works of mercy in this passage, in order that he may console those whom the statements immediately foregoing might have greatly alarmed, his purpose being to admonish us ]low those daily sins from which our life is never free here below may also be expiated by daily remedies; lest any man, becoming guilty of all when he offends in even one point, be brought, by offending in many points (since "in many things we all offend"), to appear before the bar of the Supreme Judge under the enormous amount of guilt which has accumulated by degrees, and find at that tribunal no mercy, because he showed no mercy to others, instead of rather meriting the forgiveness of his own sins, and the enjoyment of the gifts promised in Scripture, by his extending forgiveness and bounty to others.<br>
    21. I have written at great length, which may perhaps have been tedious to you, as you, although approving of tile statements now made, do not expect to be addressed as if you were but learning truths which you have been accustomed to teach to others. If, however, there be anything in these statements -- not in the style of language in which they are expounded, for I am not much concerned as to mere phrases, but in the substance of the statements -- which your erudite judgment condemns, I beseech you to point this out to me in your reply, and do not hesitate to correct my error. For I pity the man who, in view of the unwearied labour and sacred character of your studies, does not on account of them both render to you the honour which you deserve, and give thanks unto our Lord God by whose grace you are what you are. Wherefore, since I ought to be more willing to learn from any teacher the things of which to my disadvantage I am ignorant, than prompt to teach any others what I know, with how much greater reason do I claim the payment of<br>
539<br>
<br>
this debt of love from you, by whose learning ecclesiastical literature in the latin tongue has been, in the Lord's name, and by His help, advanced to an extent which had been previously unattainable. Especially, however, I ask attention to the sentence: "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and offend in one point, is guilty of all." If you know any better way, my beloved brother, in which it can be explained, I beseech you by the Lord to favour us by communicating to us your exposition.<br>

<br>
                  BISHOP AUGUSTIN TO BISHOP EVODIUS.<br>
<br>
           CHAP, I. -- I. If acquaintance with the treatises<br>
which specially occupy me, and from which I am unwilling to be turned aside to anything else, is so highly valued by your Holiness, let some one be sent to copy them for you. For I have now finished several of those which had been commenced by me this year before Easter, near the beginning of Lent. For, to the three books on the City of God, in opposition to its enemies, the worshippers of demons, I have added two others, and in these five books I think enough has been said to answer those who maintain that the [heathen] gods must be worshipped in order to secure prosperity in this present life, and who are hostile to the Christian name from an idea that that prosperity is hindered by us. In the sequel I must, as I promised in the first book, answer those who think that the worship of their gods is the only way to obtain that life after death with a view to obtain which we are Christians. I have dictated also, in volumes of considerable size, expositions of three Psalms, the 68th, the 72d, and the 78th. Commentaries on the other Psalms -- not yet dictated, nor even entered on -- are eagerly expected and demanded from me. From these studies I am unwilling to be called away and hindered by any questions thrusting themselves upon me from another quarter; yea, so unwilling, that I do not wish to turn at present even to the books on the Trinity, which I have long had on hand and have not yet completed, because they require a great amount of labour, and I believe that they are of a nature to be understood only by few; on which account they claim my attention less urgently than writings which may, I hope, be useful to very many.<br>
    2. For the words, "He that is ignorant shall be ignored were not used by the apostle in reference to this subject, as your letter affirms; as if this punishment were to be inflicted on the man who is not able to discern by the exercise of his intellect the ineffable unity of the Trinity, in the same way as the unity of memory, understanding, and will in the soul of man is discerned. The apostle said these words with a wholly different design. Consult the passage and you will see that he was speaking of those things which might be for the edification of the many in faith and holiness, not of those which might with difficulty be comprehended by the few, and by them only in the small degree in which the comprehension of so great a subject is attainable in this life. The positions laid down by him were,that prophesying was to be preferred to speaking with tongues; that these gifts should not be exercised in a disorderly manner, as if the spirit of prophecy compelled them to speak even against their will; that women should keep silence in the Church; and that all things should be done decently and in order. While treating of these things he says: "If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things which I write to you, for they are the commands of the Lord. If any man be ignorant, he shall be ignored;" intending by these words to restrain and call to order persons who were specially ready to cause disorder in the Church, because they imagined themselves to excel in spiritual gifts, although they were disturbing everything by their presumptions conduct. "If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know," he says, "the things which I write to you, for they are the commands of the Lord." If any man thinks himself to be, and in reality is not, a prophet, for he who is a prophet undoubtedly knows and does not need admonition and exhortation, because "he judgeth all things, and is himself judged of no manY s Those persons, therefore, caused confusion and trouble in the Church who thought themselves to be in the Church what they were not. He teaches these to know the commandments of the Lord, for he is not a "God of confusion, but of peace. But "if any one is ignorant, he shall be ignored," that is to say, he shall be rejected; for God is not ignorant -- so far as mere knowledge is concerned -- in regard to the persons to whom He shall one day say, "I know you not," s but their rejection is signified by this expression.<br>
    3. Moreover, since the Lord says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,"6 and that sight is promised to us as the highest reward at the last, we have no reason to fear lest, if we axe now unable to see clearly those things which we believe concerning the nature of God,<br>
<br>
540<br>
<br>
this defective apprehension should bring us under the sentence, "He that is ignorant shall be ignored." For when "in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believed." This foolishness of preaching and "foolishness of God which is wiser than man"1 draws many to salvation, in such a way that not only those who are as yet incapable of perceiving with clear intelligence the nature of God which in faith they hold, but even those who have not yet so learned the nature of their own soul as to distinguish between its incorporeal essence and the body as a whole with the same certainty with which they perceive that they live, understand, and will, are not on this account shut out from that salvation which that foolishness of preaching bestows on believers.<br>
    4. For if Christ died for those only who with clear intelligence can discern these things, our labour in the Church is almost spent in vain. But if, as is the fact, crowds of common people, possessing no great strength of intellect, run to the Physician m the exercise of faith, with the result of being healed by Christ and Him crucified, that "where sin has abounded, grace may much more abound," it comes in wondrous ways to pass, through the depths of the riches of the. wisdom and knowledge of God and His unsearchable judgments, that, on the one hand, some who do discern between the material and: the spiritual in their own nature, while pluming themselves on this attainment, and despising that foolishness of preaching by which those who believe are saved, wander far from the only path which leads to eternal life; and, on the other hand, because not one perishes for whom Christ died? many glorying in the cross of Christ, and not withdrawing from that same path, attain, notwithstanding their ignorance of those things which some with most profound subtlety investigate, unto that eternity, truth, and love, -- that is, unto that enduring, clear, and full felicity,in which to those who abide, and see, and love, all things are plain.<br>
    Chap. II. -- 5. Therefore let us with steadfast piety believe in one God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; let us at the same time believe that the Son is not [the person] who is the Father, and the Father is not [the person] who is the Son, and neither the Father nor the Son is [the person] who is the Spirit of both the Father and the Son. Let it not be supposed that in this Trinity there is any separation in respect of time or place, but that these Thee are equal and co-eternal, and absolutely of one nature: and that the creatures have been made, not some by the Father, and some by the Son, and some by the Holy Spirit, but that each and all that have been or are now being created subsist in the Trinity as their Creator; and that no one is saved by the Father without the Son and the Holy Spirit, or by the Son without the Father and the Holy Spirit, or by the Holy Spirit without the Father and the Son, but by the ,Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the only one, true, and truly immortal (that is, absolutely unchangeable) God. At the same time, we believe that many things are stated in Scripture separately concerning each of the Three, in order to teach us that, though they are an inseparable Trinity, yet they are a Trinity. For, just as when their names are pronounced in human language they cannot be named simultaneously, although their existence in inseparable union is at every moment simultaneous, even so in some places of Scripture also, they are by certain created things presented to us distinctively and in mutual relation to each other: for example, [at the baptism of Christ] the Father is heard in the voice which said, "Thou art my Son;" the Son is seen in the human nature which, in being born of the Virgin, He assumed; the Holy Spirit is seen in the bodily form of a dove,4 -- these things presenting the Three to our apprehension separately, indeed, but in no wise separated.<br>
    6. To present this in a form which the intellect may apprehend, we borrow an illustration from the Memory, the Understanding, and the Will. For although we can speak of each of these faculties severally in its own order, and at a separate time, we neither exercise nor even mention any one of them without the other two. It must not, however, be supposed, from our using this comparison between these three faculties and the Trinity, that the things compared agree in every particular, for where, in any process of reasoning, can we find an illustration in which the correspondence between the things compared is so exact that it admits of application in every point to that which it is intended to illustrate? In the first place, therefore, the similarity is found to be imperfect in this respect, i that whereas memory, understanding, and will are not the soul, but only exist in the soul, the i Trinity does not exist in God, but is God. In the Trinity, therefore, there is manifested a singleness [simplicitas] commanding our astonishment, because in this Trinity it is not one thing to exist, and another thing to understand, or do anything else which is attributed to the nature of God; but in the soul it is one thing that it exists, and another thing that it understands, for even when it is not using the understand-<br>
<br>
541<br>
<br>
ing it still exists. In the second place, who would dare to say that the Father does not understand by Himself but by the Son, as memory does not understand by itself but by the understanding, or, to speak more correctly, the soul in which these faculties are understands by no other faculty than by the understanding, as it remembers only by memory, and exercises volition only by the will? The point, therefore, to which the illustration is intended to apply is this, -- that, whatever be the manner in which we understand, in regard to these three faculties in the soul, that when the several names by which they are severally represented are uttered, the utterance of each separate name is nevertheless accomplished only in the combined operation of all the three, since it is by an act of memory and of understanding and of will that it is spoken, -- it is in the same manner that we understand, in regard to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that no created thing which may at any time be employed to present only one of the Three to our minds is produced otherwise than by the simultaneous, because essentially inseparable, operation of the Trinity; and that, consequently, neither the voice of the Father, nor the body and soul of the Son, nor the dove of the Holy Spirit, was produced in any other way than by the combined operation of the Trinity.<br>
    7. Moreover, that sound of a voice was certainly not made indissolubly one with the person of the Father, for so soon as it was uttered it ceased to be. Neither was that form of a dove made indissolubly one with the person of Holy Spirit, for it also, like the bright cloud which covered the Saviour and His three disciples on the mount, or rather like the tongues of flame which once represented the same Holy Spirit, ceased to exist as soon as it had served its purpose as a symbol. But it was otherwise with the body and soul in which the Son of God was manifested: seeing that the deliverance of men was the object for which all these things were done, the human nature in which He appeared was, in a way marvellous and unique, assumed into real union with the person of the Word of God, that is, of the only Son of God,-- the Word remaining unchangeably in His own nature, wherein it is not conceivable that there should be composite elements in union with which any mere semblance of a human soul could subsist. We read, indeed, that "the Spirit of wisdom is manifold;"2 but it is as properly termed simple. Manifold it is, indeed, because there are many things which it possesses; but simple, because it is not a different thing from what it possesses, as the Son is said to have life in Himself, and yet He is Himself that life. The human nature came to the Word; the Word did not come, with susceptibility of change, into the human nature; 3 and therefore, in His union to the human nature which He has assumed, He is still properly called the Son of God; for which reason the same person is the Son of God immutable and co-eternal with the Father, and the Son of God who was laid in the grave, -- the former being true of Him only as the Word, the latter true of Him only as a man.<br>
    8. Wherefore it behoves us, in reading any statements made concerning the Son of God, to observe in reference to which of these two natures they are spoken. For by His assumption of the soul and body of a man, no increase was made in the number of Persons: the Trinity remained as before. For just as in every man, with the exception of that one whom alone He assumed into personal union, the soul and body constitute one person, so in Christ the Word and His human soul and body constitute one person. And as the name philosopher, for example, is given to a man certainly with reference only to his soul, and yet it is nothing absurd, but only a most suitable and ordinary use of language, for us to say the philosopher was killed, the philosopher died, the philosopher was buried, although all these events befell him in his body, not in that part of him in which he was a philosopher; in like manner the name of God, or Son of God, or Lord of Glory, or any other such name, is given to Christ as the Word, and it is, nevertheless, correct to say that God was crucified, seeing that there is no question that He suffered this death in his human nature, not in that in which He is the Lord of Glory.4<br>
    9. As for the sound of the voice, however, and the bodily form of a dove, and the cloven tongues which sat upon each of them, these, like the terrible wonders wrought at Sinai,s and like the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night,6 were produced only as symbols, and vanished when this purpose had been served. The thing which we must especially guard against in connection with them is, lest any one should believe that the nature of God -- whether of the Father, or of the Son, or of the Holy Spirit -- is susceptible of change or transformation. And we must not be disturbed by the fact that the sign sometimes receives the name of the thing signified, as when the Holy Spirit is said to have descended in a bodily form as a dove and abode upon Him; for in like manner the smitten rock is called Christ,z because it was a symbol of Christ.<br>
<br>
542<br>
<br>
    CHAP. III. -- 10. I wonder, however, that, although you believe it possible for the sound of the voice which said, "Thou art my Son," to have been produced through a divine act, without the intermediate agency of a soul, by something the nature of which was corporeal, you nevertheless do not believe that a bodily form and movements exactly resembling those of any real living creature whatsoever could be produced in the same way, namely, through a divine act, without the intermediate agency of a spirit imparting life. i For if inanimate matter obeys God without the instrumentality of an animating spirit, so as to emit sounds such as are wont to be emited by animated bodies, in order to bring to the human ear words articulately spoken, why should it not obey Him, so as to present to the human eye the figure and motions of a bird, by the same power of the Creator without the instrumentalist of any animating spirit? The objects of both sight and hearing m the sound which strikes the ear and the appearance which meets the eye, the articulations of the voice and the outlines of the members, every audible and visible motion -- are both alike produced from matter contiguous to us; is it, then, granted to the sense of hearing, and not to the sense of sight, to tell us regarding the body which is perceived by this bodily sense, both that it is a true body, and that it is nothing beyond what the bodily sense perceives it to be? For in every living creature the soul is, of course, not perceived by any bodily sense. We do not, therefore, need to inquire how the bodily form of the dove appeared to the eye, just as we do not need to inquire how the voice of a bodily form capable of speech was made to fall upon the ear. For if it was possible to dispense with the intermediate agency of a soul in the case in which a voice, not something like a voice, is said to have been produced, how  much more easily was it possible in the case in which it is said that the Spirit descended "like a dove," a phrase which signifies that a mere bodily form was exhibited to the eye, and does not affirm that a real living creature was seen! In like manner, it is said that on the day of Pentecost, "suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty rushing wind, and there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire,"1 in which something like wind and like fire, i.e. resembling these common and familiar natural phenomena, is said to have been perceived, but it does not seem to be indicated that these common and familiar natural phenomena were actually produced.<br>
    11. If, however, more subtle reasoning or more thorough investigation of the matter result in demonstrating that that which is naturally destitute of motion both in time and in space [i.e. matter] cannot be moved otherwise than through the intermediate agency of that which is capable of motion only in time, not in space [i.e. spirit], it will follow from this that all those things must have been done by the instrumentality of a living creature, as things are done by angels, on which subject a more elaborate discussion would be tedious, and is not necessary. To this it must be added, that there are visions which appear to the spirit as plainly as to the senses of the body, not only in sleep or delirium, but also to persons of sound mind in n their waking hours, -- visions which are due not to the deceitfulness of devils mocking men, but to some spiritual revelation accomplished by means of immaterial forms resembling bodies, and which cannot by any means be distinguished from real objects, unless they are by divine assistance more fully revealed and discriminated by the mind's intelligence, which is done sometimes (but with difficulty) at the time, but for the most part after they have disappeared. This being the case in regard to these visions which, whether their nature be really material, or material only in appearance but really spiritual, seem to manifest themselves to our spirit as if they were perceived by the bodily senses, we ought not, when these things are recorded in sacred Scripture, to conclude hastily to which of these two classes they are to be referred, or whether, if they belong to the former, they are produced by the intermediate agency of a spirit; while, at the same time, as to the invisible and immutable nature of the Creator, that is, of the supreme and ineffable Trinity, we either simply, without any doubt, believe, or, in addition to this, with some degree of intellectual apprehension, understand that it is wholly removed and separated both from the senses of fleshly mortals, and from all susceptibility of being changed either for the worse or for the better, or to anything whatever of a variable nature.<br>
    CHAP. IV. -- 12. These things I send you in reference to two of your questions, -- the one concerning the Trinity, and the other concerning the dove in which the Holy Spirit, not in His own nature, but in a symbolical form, was manifested, as also the Son of God, not in His eternal Sonship (of which the Father said: "Before the morning star I have begotten Thee "but in that human nature which He assumed from the Virgin's womb, was crucified .by the Jews: observe that to you who are at leisure I have been able, notwithstanding immense pressure of business, to write so much. I have not, however, deemed it necessary to discuss everything which you have brought forward in your<br>
<br>
543<br>
<br>
letter; but on these two questions which you wished me to solve, I think I have written as much as is exacted by Christian charity, though I may not have satisfied your vehement desire.<br>
    13. Besides the two books added to the first three in the City of God, and the exposition of three psalms, as above mentioned,1 I have also written a treatise to the holy presbyter Jerome concerning the origin of the soul? asking him, in regard to the opinion which, in writing to Marcellinus of pious memory, he avowed as his own, that a new soul is made for each individual at birth, how this can be maintained without overthrowing that most surely established article of the Church's faith, according to which we firmly believe that all die in Adam,3 and are brought down under condemnation unless they be delivered by the grace of Christ, which, by means of His sacrament, works even in infants. I have, moreover, written to the same person to inquire his opinion as to the sense in which the words of James, "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all," are to be understood.4 In this letter I have also stated my own opinion: in the other, concerning the origin of the soul, I have only asked what was his opinion, submitting the matter to his judgment, and at the same I time discussing it to some extent. I wrote these I to Jerome because I did not wish to lose an opportunity of correspondence afforded by a certain very pious and studious young presbyter, Orosius, who, prompted only by burning zeal in regard to the Holy Scriptures, came to us from I the remotest part of Spain, namely, from the shore of the ocean, and whom I persuaded to go on from us to Jerome. In answer to certain questions of the same Orosius, as to things which troubled him in reference to the heresy of the Priscillianists, and some opinions of Origen which the Church has not accepted, I have written a treatise of moderate size with as much brevity and clearness as was in my power. I have also written a considerable book against the heresy of Pelagius,5 being constrained to do this by some brethren whom he had persuaded to adopt his fatal error, denying the grace of Christ. If you wish to have all these, send some one to copy them all for you. Allow me, however, to be free from distraction in studying and dictating to my clerks those things which, being urgently required by many, claim in my opinion precedence over your questions, which are of interest to very few.<br>

                            LETTER CLXXII.&nbsp;<br>
                              (A.D. 416.)<br>
<br>
	TO AUGUSTIN, MY TRULY PIOUS LORD AND FATHER, WORTHY OF MY UTMOST AFFECTION AND VENERATION, JEROME SENDS GREETING IN CHRIST.<br>
<br>
    I. That honourable man, my brother, and your Excellency's son, the presbyter Orosius, I have, both on his own account and in obedience to your request, made welcome. But a most trying time has come upon us,6 in which I have found it better for me to hold my peace than to speak, so that our studies have ceased, lest what Appius calls "the eloquence of dogs" should be provoked into exercise.7 For this reason I have not been able at the present time to give to those two books dedicated to my name-books of profound erudition, and brilliant with every charm of splendid eloquence -- the answer which I would otherwise have given; not that I think anything said in them demands correction, but because I am mindful of the words of the blessed apostle in regard to the variety of men's judgments, "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."8 Certainly, whatever can be said on the topics there discussed, and whatever can be drawn by commanding genius from the fountain of sacred Scripture regarding them, has been in these letters stated in your positions, and illustrated by your arguments. But I beg your Reverence to allow me for a little to praise your genius. For in any discussion between us, the object aimed at by both of us is advancement in learning. But our rivals, and especially heretics, if they see different opinions maintained by us, will assail us with the calumny that our differences are due to mutual jealousy. For my part, however, I am resolved to love you, to look up to you, to reverence and admire you, and to defend your opinions as my own. I have also in a dialogue, which I recently published, made allusion to your Blessedness in suitable terms. Be it ours, therefore, rather to rid the Church of that most pernicious heresy which always feigns repentance, in order that it may have liberty to teach in our churches, and may not be expelled and extinguished, as it would be if it disclosed its real character in the light of day.<br>
    5. Your pious and venerable daughters, Eusto-<br>
<br>
544<br>
<br>
chium and Paula, continue to walk worthy of their own birth and of your counsels, and they send special salutations to your Blessedness: in which they are joined by the whole brotherhood of those who with us labour to serve the Lord our Saviour. As for the holy presbyter Firmus, we sent him last year to go on business of Eustochium and Paula, first to Ravenna, and afterwards to Africa and Sicily, and we suppose that he is now detained somewhere in Africa. I beseech you to present my respectful salutations to the saints who are associated with you. I have also sent to your care a letter from me to the holy presbyter Firmus; if it reaches you, I beg you to take the trouble of forwarding it to him. May Christ the Lord keep you in safety, and mindful of me, my truly pious lord and most blessed father.<br>
    (As a postscript.) We suffer in this province from a grievous scarcity of clerks acquainted with the Latin language; this is the reason why we are not able to comply with your instructions, especially in regard to that version of the Septuagint which is furnished with distinctive asterisks and obelisks ; for we have lost, through some one's dishonesty, the most of the results of our earlier labour.<br>
<br>
                      LETTER CLXXIII. (A.D. 416.)<br>
<br>
	TO DONATUS, A PRESBYTER OF THE DONATIST PARTY, AUGUSTIN, A BISHOP OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    I. If you could see the sorrow of my heart and my concern for your salvation, you would perhaps take pity on your own soul, doing that which is pleasing to God, by giving heed to the: word which is not ours but His; and would no longer give to His Scripture only a place in your memory, while shutting it out from your heart. You are angry because you are being drawn to salvation, although you have drawn so many of our fellow Christians to destruction. For what did we order beyond this, that you should be arrested, brought before the authorities, and guarded, in order to prevent you from perishing? As to your having sustained bodily injury, you have yourself to blame for this, as you would not use the horse which was immediately brought to you, and then dashed yourself violently to the ground; for, as you well know, your companion, who was brought along with you, arrived uninjured, not having done any harm to himself as you did.<br>
    2. You think, however, that even what we have done to you should not have been done, because, in your opinion, no man should be compelled to that which is good. Mark, therefore, the words of the apostle: "If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work," and yet, in order to make the office of a bishop be accepted by many men, they are seized against their will subjected to importunate persuasion, shut up and detained in custody, and made to suffer so many things which they dislike, until a willingness to undertake the good work is found in them. How much more, then, is it fitting that you should be drawn forcibly away from a pernicious error, in which you are enemies to your own souls, and brought to acquaint yourselves with the truth, or to choose it when known, not only in order to your holding in a safe and advantageous way the honour belonging to your office, but also in order to preserve you from perishing miserably! You say that God has given us free will, and that therefore no man should be compelled even to good. Why, then, are those whom I have above referred to compelled to that which is good? Take heed, therefore, to something which you do not wish to consider. The aim towards which a good will compassionately devotes its efforts is to secure that a bad will be rightly directed. For who does not know that a man is not condemned on any other ground than because his bad will deserved it, and that no man is saved who has not a good will? Nevertheless, it does not follow from this that those who are loved should be cruelly left to yield themselves with impunity to their bad will; but in so far as power is given, they ought to be both prevented from evil and compelled to good.<br>
    3. For if a bad will ought to be always left to its own freedom, why were the disobedient and murmuring Israelites restrained from evil by such severe chastisements, and compelled to come into the land of promise? If a bad will ought always to be left to its own freedom, why was Paul not left to the free use of that most perverted will with which he persecuted the Church? Why was he thrown to the ground that he might be blinded, and struck blind that he might be changed, and changed that he might be sent as :an apostle, and sent that he might suffer for the truth's sake such wrongs as he had inflicted on others when he was in error? If a bad will ought always to be left to its own freedom, why is a father instructed in Holy Scripture not only to correct an obstinate son by words of rebuke, but also to beat his sides, in order that, being compelled and subdued, he may be guided to good conduct?3 For which reason Solomon<br>
<br>
545<br>
<br>
also says: "Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell."1 If a bad will ought always to be left to its own freedom, why are negligent pastors reproved? and why is it said to them, "Ye have not brought back the wandering sheep, ye have not sought the perishing"?2 You also are sheep belonging to Christ, you bear the Lord's mark in the sacrament which you have received, but you are wandering and perishing. Let us not, therefore, incur your displeasure because we bring back the wandering: and seek the perishing; for it is better for us! to obey the will of the Lord, who charges us to compel you to return to His fold, than to yield consent to the will of the wandering sheep, so as to leave you to perish. Say not, therefore, what I hear that you are constantly saying, "I wish thus to wander; I wish thus to perish;" for it is better that we should so far as is in our power absolutely refuse to allow you to wander and perish.<br>
    4. When you threw yourself the other day into a well, in order to bring death upon yourself, you did so no doubt with your free will. But how cruel the servants of God would have been if they had left you to the fruits of this bad will, and had not delivered you from that death ! Who would not have justly blamed them? Who would not have justly denounced them as inhuman? And yet you, with your own free will, threw yourself into the water that you might be drowned. They took you against your will out of the water, that you might not be drowned. You acted according to your own will, but with a view to your destruction; they dealt with you against your will, but in order to your preservation. If, therefore, mere bodily safety behoves to be so guarded that it is the duty of those who love their neighhour to preserve him even against his own will from harm, how much more is this! duty binding in regard to that spiritual health i in the loss of which the consequence to be dreaded is eternal death! At the same time let me remark, that in that death which you wished to bring upon yourself you would have died not for time only but for eternity, because even though force had been used to compel you -- not to accept salvation, not to enter into the peace of the Church, the unity of Christ's body, the holy indivisible charity, but -- to suffer some evil things, it would not have been lawful for you to take away your own life.<br>
    5. Consider the divine Scriptures, and examine them to the utmost of your ability, and see whether this was ever done by any one of the just and faithful, though subjected to the most grievous evils by persons who were endeavouring to drive them, not to eternal life, to which you are being compelled by us, but to eternal death. I have heard that you say that the Apostle Paul intimated the lawfulness of suicide, when he said, "Though I give my body to be burned," a supposing that because he was there enumerating all the good things which are of no avail without charity, such as the tongues of men and of angels, and all mysteries, and all knowledge, and all prophecy, and the distribution of one's goods to the poor, he intended to include among these good things the act of bringing death upon one. self. But observe carefully and learn in what .sense Scripture says that any man may give his body to be burned. Certainly not that any man may throw himself into the fire when he is harassed by a pursuing enemy, but that, when he is compelled to choose between doing wrong and suffering wrong, he should refuse to do wrong rather than to suffer wrong, and so give his body into the power of the executioner, as those three men did who were being compelled to worship the golden image, while he who was compelling them threatened them with the burning fiery furnace if they did not obey. They refused to worship the image: they did not cast themselves into the fire, and yet of them it is written that they "yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God."4 This is the sense in which the apostle said, "If I give my body to be burned."<br>
    6. Mark also what follows: -- "If I have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." To that charity you are called; by that charity you are prevented from perishing: and yet you think, forsooth, that to throw yourself headlong to destruction, by your own act, will profit you in some measure, although, even if you suffered death at the hands of another, while you remain an enemy to charity it would profit you nothing. Nay, more, being in a state of exclusion from the Church, and severed from the body of unity and the bond of charity, you would be punished with eternal misery even though you were burned alive for Christ's name; for this is the apostle's declaration, "Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." Bring your mind back, therefore, to rational reflection and sober thought; consider carefully whether it is to error and to impiety that you are being called, and, if you still think so, submit patiently to any hardship for the truth's sake. If, however, the fact rather be that you are living in error and in impiety, mad that in the Church to which you are called truth and piety are found, because there is Christian unity and the love (charitas) of the Holy Spirit, why<br>
<br>
546<br>
<br>
do you labour any longer to be an enemy to yourself?<br>
    7. For this end the mercy of the Lord appointed that both we and your bishops met at Carthage in a conference which had repeated meetings, and was largely attended, and reasoned together in the most orderly manner in regard to the grounds of our separation from each other. The proceedings of that conference were written down; our signatures are attached to the record: read it, or allow others to read it to you, and then choose which party you prefer. I have heard that you have said that you could to some extent discuss the statements in that record with us if we would omit these words of your bishops: "No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person." You wish us to leave out these words, in which, although they knew it not, the truth itself spoke by them. You will say, indeed, that here they made a mistake, and fell through want of consideration into a false opinion. But we affirm that here they said what was true, and we prove this very easily by a reference to yourself. For if in regard to these bishops of your own, chosen by the whole party of Donatus on the understanding that they should act as representatives, and that all the rest should regard whatever they did as acceptable and satisfactory, you nevertheless refuse to allow them to compromise your position by what you think to have been a rash and mistaken utterance on their part, in this refusal you confirm the truth of their saying: "No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person." And at the same time you ought to acknowledge, that if you refuse to allow the conjoint authority of so many of your bishops represented in these seven to compromise Donatus, presbyter in Mutugenna, it is incomparably less reasonable that one person, Caecilianus, even had some evil been found in him, should compromise the position of the whole unity of Christ, the Church, which is not shut up within the one village of Mutugenna, but spread abroad throughout the entire world.<br>
    8. But, behold, we do what you have desired; we treat with you as if your bishops had not said: "No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person." Discover, if you can, what they ought, rather than this, to have said in reply, when there was alleged against them the case and the person of Primianus,1 who, notwithstanding his joining the rest of the bishops in passing sentence of condemnation on those who had passed sentence of condemnation upon him, nevertheless received back into their former honours those whom he had condemned and denounced, and chose to acknowledge and accept rather than despise and repudiate the baptism administered by these men while they were "dead" (for of them it was said in the notable decree [of the Council of Bagai], that "the shores were full of dead men"), and by so doing swept away the argument which you are accustomed to rest on a perverse interpretation of the words: "Qui baptizatur a mortuo quid ei prodest lavacrum ejus?"2 If, therefore, your bishops had not said: "No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person," they would have been compelled to plead guilty in the case of Primianus; but, in saying this, they declared the Catholic Church to be, as we mentioned, not guilty in the case of Caecilianus.<br>
    9. However, read all the rest and examine it well. Mark whether they have succeeded in proving any charge of evil brought against Caecilianus himself, through whose person they attempted to compromise the position of the Church. Mark whether they have not rather brought forward much that was in his favour, and confirmed the evidence that his case was a good one, by a number of extracts which, to the prejudice of their own case, they produced and read. Read these or let them be read to you. Consider the whole matter, ponder it carefully, and choose which you should follow: whether you should, in the peace of Christ, in the unity of the Catholic Church, in the love of the brethren, be partaker of our joy, or, in the cause of wicked discord, the Donatist faction and impious schism, continue to suffer the annoyance caused to you by the measures which out of love to you we are compelled to take.<br>
    10. I hear that you have remarked and often quote the fact recorded in the gospels, that the seventy disciples went back from the Lord, and that they had been left to their own choice in this wicked and impious desertion, and that to the twelve who alone remained the Lord said, "Will ye also go away?"3 But you have neglected to remark, that at that time the Church was only beginning to burst into life from the recently planted seed, and that there was not yet fulfilled in her the prophecy: "All kings shall fall down before Him; yea, all nations shall serve<br>
<br>
547<br>
<br>
Him;"1 and it is in proportion to the more enlarged accomplishment of this prophecy that the Church wields greater power, so that she may not only invite, but even compel men to embrace what is good. This our Lord intended then to illustrate, for although He had great power, He chose rather to manifest His humility. This also He taught, with sufficient plainness, in the parable of the Feast, in which the master of the house, after He had sent a message to the invited guests, and they had refused to come, said to his servants: "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. And the Lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.", Mark, now, how it was said in regard to those who came first, "bring them in;" it was not said, "compel them to come in," -- by which was signified the incipient condition of the Church, when it was only growing towards the position in which it would have strength to compel men to come in. Accordingly, because it was right that when the Church had been strengthened, both in power and in extent, men should be compelled to come in to the feast of everlasting salvation, it was afterwards added in the parable, "The servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. And the Lord said unto the servants, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in." Wherefore, if you were walking peaceably, absent from this feast of everlasting salvation and of the holy unity of the Church, we should find you, as it were, in the "highways;" but since, by multiplied injuries and cruelties, which you perpetrate on our people, you are, as it were, full of thorns and roughness, we find you as it were in the "hedges," and we compel you to come in. The sheep which is compelled is driven whither it would not wish to go, but after it has entered, it feeds of its own accord in the pastures to which it was brought. Wherefore restrain your, perverse and rebellious spirit, that in the true Church of Christ you may find the feast of salvation.<br>

                            LETTER CLXXX.&nbsp;<br>
                             (A.D. 416.)<br>
<br>
	TO OCEANUS, HIS DESERVEDLY BELOVED LORD AND BROTHER, HONOURED AMONG THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    I. I received two letters from you at the same time, in one of which you mention a third, and state that you had sent it before the others. This letter I do not remember having received, or, rather, I think I may say the testimony of :my memory is, that I did not receive it; but in regard to those which I have received, I return you many thanks for your kindness to me. To these I would have returned an immediate answer, had I not been hurried away by a constant succession of other matters urgently demanding attention. Having now found a moment's leisure from these, I have chosen rather to send some reply, however imperfect, than continue towards a friend so true and kind a protracted silence, and become more annoying to you by saying nothing than by saying too much.<br>
    2. I already knew the opinion of the holy Jerome as to the origin of souls, and had read the words which in your letter you have quoted from his book. The difficulty which perplexes some in regard to this question, "How God can justly bestow souls on the offspring of persons guilty of adultery?" does not embarrass me, seeing that not even their own sins, much less the sins of their parents, can prove prejudicial to persons -- of virtuous lives, converted to God,  and living in faith and piety. The really difficult question is, if it be true that a new soul !created out of nothing is imparted to each child lot its birth, how can it be that the innumerable souls of those little ones, in regard to whom God knew with certainty that before attaining the age of reason, and before being able to know or understand what is right or wrong, they were to leave the body without being baptized, are justly given over to eternal death by Him with whom "there is no unrighteousness!"3 It is unnecessary to say more on this subject, since you know what I intend, or rather what I do not at present intend to say. I think what I have i said is enough for a wise man. If, however, you have either read, or heard from the lips of Jerome, or received from the Lord when meditating on this difficult question, anything by which it can be solved, impart it to me, I beseech you, that I may acknowledge myself under yet greater obligation to you.<br>
    3. As to the question whether lying is in any case justifiable and expedient, it has appeared to you that it ought to be solved by the example of our Lord's saying, concerning the day and hour of the end of the world, "Neither doth the Son know it." 4 When I read this, I was charmed with it as an effort of your ingenuity; but I am by no means of opinion that a figurative mode of expression can be rightly termed a falsehood. For it is no falsehood to call a day joyous because it renders men joyous, or a lupine harsh because by its bitter flavour it imparts harshness<br>
<br>
548<br>
<br>
to the countenance of him who tastes it, or to say that God knows something when He makes man know it (an instance quoted by yourself in these words of God to Abraham, "Now I know that thou fearest God").1 These are by no means false statements, as you yourself readily see. Accordingly, when the blessed Hilary explained this obscure statement of the Lord, by means of this obscure kind of figurative language, saying that we ought to understand Christ to affirm in these words that He knew not that day with no other meaning than that He, by concealing it, caused others not to know it, he did not by this explanation of the statement apologize for it as an excusable falsehood, but he showed that it was not a falsehood, as is proved by comparing it not only with these common figures of speech, but also with the metaphor, a mode of expression very familiar to all in daily conversation. For who will charge the man who says that harvest fields wave and children bloom with speaking falsely, because he sees not in these things the waves and the flowers to which these words are literally applied?<br>
    4. Moreover, a man of your talent and learning easily perceives how different from these metaphorical expressions is the statement of the apostle, "When I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"2 Here there is no obscurity of figurative language; these are literal words of a plain statement. Surely, in addressing persons "of whom he travailed in birth till Christ should be formed in them,"3 and to whom, in solemnly calling God to confirm his words, he said: "The things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not,"4 the great teacher of the Gentiles affirmed in the words above quoted either what was true or what was false; if he said what was false, which God forbid, you see the consequences which would follow; and Paul's own assertion of his veracity, together with the example of wondrous humility in the Apostle Peter, may warn you to recoil from such thoughts.5<br>
    5. But why say more? This question the venerable Father Jerome and I have discussed fully in letters6 which we exchanged, and in his latest work, published under the name of Critobulus, against Pelagius,7 he has maintained the same opinion concerning that transaction and the words of the apostle which, in accordance with the views of the blessed Cyprian,8 I myself have held. In regard to the question as to the origin of souls, I think there is reasonable ground for inquiry, not as to the giving of souls to the offspring of adulterous parents, but as to the condemnation (which God forbid) of those who are innocent. If you have learned anything from a man of such character and eminence as Jerome which might form a satisfactory answer to those in perplexity on this subject, I pray you not to refuse to communicate it to me. In your correspondence, you have approved Yourself so learned and so affable that it is a  privilege to hold intercourse with you by letter.I ask you not to delay to send a certain book by the same man of God, which the presbyter Orosius brought and gave to you to copy, in which the resurrection of the body is treated of by him in a manner said to merit distinguished praise. We have not asked it earlier, because we knew that you had both to copy and to revise it; but for both of these we think we have now given you ample time.<br>
	  Live to God, and be mindful of us.<br>

<br>
	TO THE LADY JULIANA, WORTHY TO BE HONOURED IN CHRIST WITH THE SERVICE DUE TO HER RANK, OUR DAUGHTER DESERVEDLY DISTINGUISHED, ALYPIUS AND AUGUSTIN SEND GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    CHAP. I. -- I. Lady, worthy to be honoured in Christ with the service due to your rank, and daughter deservedly distinguished, it was very pleasant and agreeable to us that your letter reached us when together at Hippo, so that we might send this joint reply to you, to express our joy in hearing of your welfare, and with sincere reciprocation of your love to let you know of our welfare, in which we are sure that you take an affectionate interest. We are well aware that you are not ignorant how great Christian affection we consider due to you, and how much, both before God and among men, we are interested in you. For though we knew you, at first by letter, afterwards by personal intercourse, to be pious and Catholic, that is, true members<br>
549<br>
<br>
o f the body of Christ, nevertheless, our humble ministry also was of use to you, for when you had received the word of God from us, "you received it," as says the apostle, "not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God." Through the grace and mercy of the Saviour, so great was the fruit arising from this ministery of ours in your family, that when preparations for her marriage were already completed, the holy Demetrias preferred the spiritual embrace of that Husband who is fairer than the sons of men, and in espousing themselves to whom virgins retain their virginity, and gain more abundant spiritual fruitfulness. We should not, however, yet have known how this exhortation of ours had been received by the faithful and noble maiden, as we departed shortly before she took on her the vow of chastity, had we not learned from the joyful announcement and reliable testimony of your letter, that this great gift of God, planted and watered indeed by means of His servants, but owing its increase to Himself, had been granted to us as labourers in His vineyard.<br>
    2. Since these things are so, no one may charge us with presuming, if, on the ground of this closer spiritual relation, we manifest our solicitude for your welfare by warning you to avoid opinions opposed to the grace of God. For though the apostle commands us in preaching the word to be "instant in season and out of season," yet we do not reckon you among the number of those to whom a word or a letter from us exhorting you carefully to avoid what is inconsistent with sound doctrine would seem "out of season." Hence it was that you received our admonition in so kindly a manner, that, in the letter to which we are now replying, you say, "I thank you heartily for the pious advice which your Reverence gave me, not to lend an ear to those men who, by their mischievous writings, often corrupt our holy faith."<br>
    3. In this letter you go on to say, "But your Reverence knows that I and my household are entirely separated from persons of this description; and all our family follow so strictly the Catholic faith as never at any time to have wandered from it, or fallen into any heresy, -- I speak not of the heresy of sects who have erred in a measure hardly admiring of expiation, but of those whose errors seem to be trivial." This statement renders it more and more necessary for us, in writing to you, not to pass over in silence the conduct of those who are attempting to corrupt even those who are sound in the faith. We consider your house to be no insignificant Church of Christ, nor indeed is the error of those men trivial who think that we have of ourselves whatever righteousness, temperance, piety, chastity is in us, on the ground that God has so formed us, that beyond the revelation which He has given He imparts to us no further aid for performing by our own choice those things which by study we have ascertained to be our duty; declaring nature and knowledge to be the grace of God, and the only aid for living righteously and justly. For the possession, indeed, of a will inclined to what is good, whence proceed the life of uprightness and that love which so far excels all other gifts that God Himself is said to be love, and by which alone is fulfilled in us as far as we fulfil them, the divine law and council, -- for the possession, I say, of such a will, they hold that we are not indebted to the aid of God, but affirm that we ourselves of our own will are sufficient for these things. Let it not appear to you a trifling error that men should wish to profess themselves Christians, and yet be unwilling to hear the apostle of Christ, who, having said, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts," lest any one should think that he had this love through his own free will, immediately subjoined, "by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us." Understand, then, how greatly and how fatally that man errs who does not acknowledge that this is the "great gift of the Saviour," who, when He ascended on high, "led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."<br>
    CHAP. II. -- 4. How, then, could we so far conceal our true feelings as not to warn you, in whom we feel so deep an interest, to beware of such doctrines, after we had read a certain book addressed to the holy Demetrias? Whether this book has reached you, and who is its author, we are desirous to hear in your answer to this. In this book, were it lawful for such a one to read it, a virgin of Christ would read that her holiness and all her spiritual riches are to spring from no other source than herself, and thus, before she attains to the perfection of blessedness, she would learn, -- which may God forbid! -- to be ungrateful to God. For the words addressed to her in the said book are these: -- "You have here, then, those things on account of which you are deservedly, nay more, more especially to be preferred before others; for your earthly rank and wealth are understood to be derived from your relatives, not from yourself, but your spiritual riches no one can have conferred on you but yourself; for these, then, you are justly to be praised, for these you are de-<br>
<br>
550<br>
<br>
servedly to be preferred to others, for they can exist only from yourself, and in yourself."<br>
    5. You see, doubtless, how dangerous is the doctrine in these words, against which you must be on your guard. For the affirmation, indeed, that these spiritual riches can exist only in yourself, is very well and truly said: that evidently is food; but the affirmation that they cannot exist except from you is unmixed poison. Far be it from any virgin of Christ willingly to listen to statements like these. Every virgin of Christ understands the innate poverty of the human heart, and therefore declines to have it adorned otherwise than by the gifts of her Spouse. Let her rather listen to the apostle when he says: "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." And therefore in regard to these spiritual riches let her listen, not to him who says: "No one can confer them on you except yourself, and they cannot exist except from you and in you;" but to him who says: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."<br>
    6. In regard to that sacred virginal chastity, also, which does not belong to her from herself, but is the gift of God, bestowed, however, on her who is believing and willing, let her hear the same truthful and pious teacher, who when he treats of this subject says: "I would that all men were even as I myself: but every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that." Let her hear also Him who is the only Spouse, not only of herself, but of the whole Church, thus speaking of this chastity and purity: "All cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given;" that she may understand that for her possession of this so great and excellent gift, she ought rather to render thanks to our God and Lord, than to listen to the words of any one who says that she possessed it from herself, -- words which we may not designate as those of a flatterer seeking to please, lest we seem to judge rashly concerning the hidden thoughts of men, but which are assuredly those of a misguided eulogist. For "every good gift and every perfect gift," as the Apostle James says, "is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights;" from this source, therefore, cometh this holy virginity, in which you who approve of it, and rejoice in it, have been excelled by your daughter, who, coming after you in birth, has gone before you in conduct; descended from you in lineage, has risen above you in honour; following you in age, has gone beyond you in holiness; in whom also that begins to be yours which could not be in your own person. For she did not contract an earthly marriage, that she might be, not for herself only, but also for you, spiritually enriched, in a higher degree than yourself, since you, even with this addition, are inferior to her, because you contracted the marriage of which she is the offspring. These things are gifts of God, and are yours, indeed, but are not from yourselves; for you have this treasure in earthly bodies, which are still frail as the vessels of the potter, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of you. And be not surprised because we say that these things are yours, and not from you, for we speak of "daily bread" as ours, but yet add, "give it to us," test it should be thought that it was from ourselves.<br>
    7. Wherefore obey the precept of Scripture, "Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks;" for you pray in order that you may have constantly and increasingly these gifts, you render thanks because you have them not of yourself. For who separates you from that mass of death and perdition derived from Adam? Is it not He "who came to seek and to save that which was lost?" Was, then, a man, indeed, on hearing the apostle's question, "Who maketh thee to differ?" to reply, "My own good will, my faith, my righteousness," and to disregard what immediately follows? "What hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" We are unwilling, then, yea, utterly unwilling, that a consecrated virgin, when she hears or reads these words: "Your spiritual riches no one can have conferred on you; for these you are justly to be praised, for these you are deservedly to be preferred to others, for they can exist only from yourself, and in yourself," should thus boast of her riches as if she had not received them. Let her say, indeed, "In me are Thy vows, O God, I will render praises unto Thee;" but since they are in her, not from her, let her remember also to say, "Lord, by Thy will Thou hast furnished strength to my beauty," because, though it be from her, inasmuch as it is the acting of her own will, without which we cannot do what is good, yet we are not to say, as he said, that it is "only from her." For our own will, unless it be aided by the grace<br>
<br>
551<br>
<br>
of God, cannot alone be even in name good will, for, says the apostle, "it is God who worketh in us, both to will, and to do according to good will," -- not, as these persons think, merely by revealing knowledge, that we may know what we ought to do, but also by inspiring Christian love, that we may also by choice perform the things which by study we have learned.<br>
    8. For doubtless the value of the gift of continence was known to him who said," I perceived that no man can be continent unless God bestowed the gift." He not only knew then how great a benefit it was, and how eagerly it ought to be coveted, but also that, unless God gave it, it could not exist; for wisdom had taught him  this for he says, "This also was a point of wisdom, to know whose gift it was; and the knowledge did not suffice him, but he says, "I went to the Lord and made my supplication to Him." God then aids us in this matter, not only by making us know what is to be done, but also by making us do through love what we already know through learning. No one, therefore, can possess, not only knowledge, but also continence, unless God give it to him. Whence it was that when he had knowledge he prayed that he might have continence, that it might be in him, because he knew that it was not from him; or if on account of the freedom of his will it was in a certain sense from himself, yet it was not from himself alone, because no one can be continent unless God bestow on him the gift. But he whose opinions I am censuring, in speaking of spiritual riches, among which is doubtless that bright and beautiful gift of continence, does not say that they may exist in you, and from yourself, but says that they can exist only from you, and in you, in such a way that, as a virgin of Christ has these things nowhere else than in herself, so it can be believed possible for her to have them from no other source than from herself, and in this way (which may a merciful God avert from her heart!) she shall so boast as if she had not received them!<br>
    CHAP. III. -- 9. We indeed hold such an opinion concerning the training of this holy virgin, and the Christian humility in which she was nourished and brought up, as to be assured that when she read these words, if she did read, them, she would break out into lamentations, and humbly smite her breast, and perhaps burst into tears, and pray in faith to the Lord to whose service she was dedicated and by whom she was sanctified, pleading with Him that these were not her own words, but another's, and asking that her faith might not be such as to believe that she had anything whereof to glory in herself and not in the Lord. For her glory is in herself, not in the words of another, as the apostle says: "Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have glory (rejoicing) in himself alone, and not in another." But God forbid that her glory should be in herself, and not in Him to whom the Psalmist says, "Thou art my glory, and the lifter up of mine head." For her glory is then profitably in herself, when God, who is in her, is Himself her glory, from whom she has every good, by which she is good, and shall have all things by which she shall be made better, in as far as she may become better in this life, and by which she shall be made perfect when rendered so by divine grace, not by human praise. "For her soul shall be praised in the Lord," "who satisfieth her desire with good things," because He Himself has inspired this desire, that His virgin should not boast of any good, as if she had not received it.<br>
    10. Inform us, then, in reply to this letter, whether we have judged truly in supposing these to be your daughter's sentiments. For we know well that you and all your family are, and have been, worshippers of the indivisible Trinity. But human error insinuates itself in other forms than in erroneous opinions concerning the indivisible Trinity. There are other subjects also, in regard to which men fall into very dangerous errors. As, for example, that of which we have spoken in this letter at greater length, perhaps, than might have sufficed to a person of your stedfast and pure wisdom. And yet we know not to whom, except to God, and therefore to the Trinity, wrong is done by the man who denies that the good that comes from God is from God; which evil may God avert from you, as we believe He does! May God altogether forbid that the book out of which we have thought it our duty to extract some words, that they might be more easily understood, should produce any such impression, we do not say on your mind, or on that of the holy virgin your daughter, but on the mind of the least deserving of your male or female servants.<br>
    11. But if you study more carefully even those words in which the writer appears to speak in favour of grace or the aid of God, you will find them so ambiguous that they may have reference either to nature or to knowledge, or to forgiveness of sins. For even in regard to that which they are forced to acknowledge, that we ought to pray that we may not enter into temptation, they may consider that the words mean that we are so far helped to it that, by our praying and knocking, the knowledge of the truth<br>
<br>
552<br>
<br>
is so revealed to us that we may learn what it is our duty to do, not so far as that our will receives strength, whereby we may do that which we learn to be our duty; and as to their saying that it is by the grace or help of God that the Lord Christ has been set before us as an example of holy living, they interpret this so as to teach the same doctrine, affirming, namely, that we learn by His example how we ought to live, but denying that we are so aided as to do through love what we know by learning.<br>
    12. Find in this book, if you can, anything in which, excepting nature and the freedom of the will (which pertains to the same nature), and the remission of sin and the revealing of doctrine, any such aid of God is acknowledged as that which he acknowledges who said: "When I perceived that no man can be continent unless God bestow the gift, and that this also is a point of wisdom to know whose gift it is, I went to the Lord, and made my supplication to Him." For he did not desire to receive, in answer to his prayer, the nature in which he was made; nor was he solicitous to obtain the natural freedom of the will with which he was made; nor did he crave the remission of sins, seeing that he prayed rather for continence, that he might not sin; nor did he desire to know what he ought to do, seeing that he already confessed that he knew whose gift this continence was; but he wished to receive from the Spirit of wisdom such strength of will, such ardour of love, as should suffice for fully practising the great virtue of continence. If, therefore, you succeed in finding any such statement in that book, we will heartily thank you if, in your answer, you deign to inform us of it.<br>
    13. It is impossible for us to tell how greatly we desire to find in the writings of these men, whose works are read by very many for their pungency and eloquence, the open confession of that grace which the apostle vehemently commends, who says that "God has given to every man the measure of faith," "without which it is impossible to please God," "by which the just live," "which worketh by love," before which and without which no works of any man are in any respect to be reckoned good, since "whatsoever is not of faith is sin." He affirms that God distributes to every man, and that we receive divine assistance to live piously and justly, not only by the revelation of that knowledge which without charity "puffeth up," but by our being inspired with that "love which is the fulfilling of the law," and which so edifies our heart that knowledge does not puff it up. But hitherto I have failed to find any such statements in the writings of these men.<br>
    14. But especially we should wish that these sentiments should be found in that book from which we have quoted the words in which the author, praising a virgin of Christ as if no one except herself could confer on her spiritual riches, and as if these could not exist except from herself, does not wish her to glory in the Lord, but to glory as if she had not received them. In this book, though it contain neither his name nor your own honoured name, he nevertheless mentions that a request had been made to him by the mother of the virgin to write to her. In a certain epistle of his, however, to which he openly attaches his name, and does not conceal the name of the sacred virgin, the same Pelagius says that he had written to her, and endeavours to prove, by appealing to the said work, that he most openly confessed the grace of God, which he is alleged to have passed over in silence, or denied. But we beg you to condescend to inform us, in your reply, whether that be the very book in which he has inserted these words about spiritual riches, and whether it has reached your Holiness.<br>
<br>
                       LETTER CLXXXIX. (A.D. 418.)<br>
	TO BONIFACE,10 MY NOBLE LORD AND JUSTLY DISTINGUISHED AND HONOURABLE SON, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I. I had already written a reply to your Charity, but while I was waiting for an opportunity of forwarding the letter, my beloved son Faustus arrived here on his way to your Excellency. After he had received the letter which I had intended to be carried by him to your Benevolence, he stated to me that you were very desirous that I should write you something which might build<br>
<br>
553<br>
<br>
you up unto the eternal salvation of which you have hope in Christ Jesus our Lord. And, although I was busily occupied at the time, he insisted, with an earnestness corresponding to the love which, as you know, he bears to you, that I should do this without delay. To meet his convenience, therefore, as he was in haste to depart, I thought it better to write, though necessarily without much time for reflection, rather than put off the gratification of your pious desire, my noble lord and justly distinguished and honourable son.<br>
    2. All is contained in these brief sentences: "Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength: and love thy neighbour as thyself;" for these are the words in which the Lord, when on earth, gave an epitome of religion, saying in the gospel, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Daily advance, then, in this love, both by praying and by well-doing, that through the help of Him, who enjoined it on you, and whose gift it is, it may be nourished and increased, until, being perfected, it render you perfect. "For this is the love which," as the apostle says, "is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us." This is "the fulfilling of the law;" this is the same love by which faith works, of which he says again, "Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith, which worketh by love."<br>
    3. In this love, then, all our holy fathers, patriarchs, prophets, and apostles pleased God. In this all true martyrs contended against the devil even to the shedding of blood, and because in them it neither waxed cold nor failed, they became conquerors. In this all true believers daily make progress, seeking to acquire not an earthly kingdom, but the kingdom of heaven; not a temporal, but an eternal inheritance; not gold and silver, but the incorruptible riches of the angels; not the good things of this life, which are enjoyed with trembling, and which no one can take with him when he dies, but the vision of God, whose grace and power of imparting felicity transcend all beauty of form in bodies not only on earth but also in heaven, transcend all spiritual loveliness in men, however just and holy, transcend all the glory of the angels and powers of the world above, transcend not only all that language can express, but all that thought can imagine concerning Him. And let us not despair of the fulfilment of such a great promise because it is exceeding great, but rather believe that we shall receive it because He who has promised it is exceeding great, as the blessed Apostle John says: "Now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is."<br>
    4. Do not think that it is impossible for any one to please God while engaged in active military service. Among such persons was the holy David, to whom God gave so great a testimony; among them also were many righteous men of that time; among them was also that centurion who said to the Lord: "I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed: for I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it;" and concerning whom the Lord said: "Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel." Among them was that Cornelius to whom an angel said: "Cornelius, thine alms are accepted, and thy prayers are heard," when he directed him to send to the blessed Apostle Peter, and to hear from him what he ought to do, to which apostle he sent a devout soldier, requesting him to come to him. Among them were also the soldiers who, when they had come to be baptized by John, -- the sacred forerunner of the Lord, and the friend of the Bridegroom, of whom the Lord says: "Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist," -- and had inquired of him what they should do, received the answer, "Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages." Certainly he did not prohibit them to serve as soldiers when he commanded them to be content with their pay for the service.<br>
    5. They occupy indeed a higher place before God who, abandoning all these secular employments, serve Him with the strictest chastity; but "every one," as the apostle says, "hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that." Some, then, in praying for you, fight against your invisible enemies; you, in fighting for them, contend against the barbarians, their visible enemies. Would that one faith existed in all, for then there would be less weary struggling, and the devil with his angels would be more easily conquered; but since it is necessary in this life that the citizens of the kingdom of heaven should be subjected to temptations among erring and impious men, that they<br>
<br>
554<br>
<br>
may be exercised, and "tried as gold in the furnace," we ought not before the appointed time to desire to live with those alone who are holy and righteous, so that, by patience, we may deserve to receive this blessedness in its proper time.<br>
    6. Think, then, of this first of all, when you are arming for the battle, that even your bodily strength is a gift of God; for, considering this, you will not employ the gift of God against God. For, when faith is pledged, it is to be kept even with the enemy against whom the war is waged, how much more with the friend for whom the battle is fought! Peace should be the object of your desire; war should be waged only as a necessity, and waged only that God may by it deliver men from the necessity and preserve them in peace. For peace is not sought in order to the kindling of war, but war is waged in order that peace may be obtained. Therefore, even in waging war, cherish the spirit of a peacemaker, that, by conquering those whom you attack, you may lead them back to the advantages of peace; for our Lord says: "Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God." If, however, peace among men be so sweet as procuring temporal safety, how much sweeter is that peace with God which procures for men the eternal felicity of the angels! Let necessity, therefore, and not your will, slay the enemy who fights against you. As violence is used towards him who rebels and resists, so mercy is due to the vanquished or the captive, especially in the case in which future troubling of the peace is not to be feared.<br>
    7. Let the manner of your life be adorned by chastity, sobriety, and moderation; for it is exceedingly disgraceful that lust should subdue him whom man finds invincible, and that wine should overpower him whom the sword assails in vain. As to worldly riches, if you do not possess them, let them not be sought after on earth by doing evil; and if you possess them, let them by good works be laid up in heaven. The manly and Christian spirit ought neither to be elated by the accession, nor crushed by the loss of this world's treasures. Let us rather think of what the Lord says: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also;" and certainly, when we hear the exhortation to lift up our hearts, it is our duty to give unfeignedly the response which you know that we are accustomed to give.<br>
    8. In these things, indeed, I know that you are very careful, and the good report which I hear of you fills me with great delight, and moves me to congratulate you on account of it in the Lord. This letter, therefore, may serve rather as a mirror in which you may see what you are, than as a directory from which to learn what you ought to be: nevertheless, whatever you may discover, either from this letter or from the Holy Scriptures, to be still wanting to you in regard to a holy life, persevere in urgently seeking it both by effort and by prayer; and for the things which you have, give thanks to God as the Fountain of goodness, whence you have received them; in every good action let the glory be given to God, and humility be exercised by you, for, as it is written, "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights." But however much you may advance in the love of God and of your neighbour, and in true piety, do not imagine, as long as you are in this life, that you are without sin, for concerning this we read in Holy Scripture: "Is not the life of man upon earth a life of temptation?" Wherefore, since always, as long as you are in this body, it is necessary for you to say in prayer, as the Lord taught us: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors," remember quickly to forgive, if any one shall do you wrong and shall ask pardon from you, that you may be able to pray sincerely, and may prevail in seeking pardon for your own sins.<br>
    These things, my beloved friend, I have written to you in haste, as the anxiety of the bearer to depart urged me not to detain him; but I thank God that I have in some measure complied with your pious wish. May the mercy of God ever protect you, my noble lord and justly distinguished son.<br>
<br>
                              LETTER CXCI.<br>
                               (A.D. 418.)<br>
	TO MY VENERABLE LORD AND PIOUS BROTHER AND CO-PRESBYTER SIXTUS,8 WORTHY OF BEING RECEIVED IN THE LOVE OF CHRIST, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. Since the arrival of the letter which, in my absence, your Grace forwarded by our holy brother the presbyter Firmus, and which I read on my return to Hippo, but not until after the bearer had departed, the present is my first opportunity<br>
<br>
555<br>
<br>
of sending to you any reply, and it is with great pleasure that I entrust it to our very dearly beloved son, the acolyte Albinus. Your letter, addressed to Alypius and myself jointly, came at a time when we were not together, and this is the reason why you will now receive a letter from each of us, instead of one from both, in reply. For the bearer of this letter has just gone, meanwhile, from me to visit my venerable brother and co-bishop Alypius, who will write a reply for himself to your Holiness, and he has carried with him your letter, which I had already perused. As to the great joy with which that letter filled my heart, why should a man attempt to say what it is impossible to express? Indeed, I do not think that you yourself have any adequate idea of the amount of good done by your sending that letter to us; but take our word for it, for as you bear witness to your feelings, so do we bear witness to ours, declaring how profoundly we have been moved by the perfectly transparent soundness of the views declared in that letter. For if, when you sent a very short letter on the same subject to the most blessed aged Aurelius, by the acolyte Leo, we transcribed it with joyful alacrity, and read it with enthusiastic interest to all who were within our reach, as an exposition of your sentiments, both in regard to that most fatal dogma [of Pelagius], and in regard to the grace of God freely given by Him to small and great, to which that dogma is diametrically opposed; how great, think you, is the joy with which we have read this more extended statement in your writing, how great the zeal with which we take care that it be read by all to whom we have been able already or may yet be able to make it known! For what could be read or heard with greater satisfaction than so clear a defence of the grace of God against its enemies, from the mouth of one who was before this proudly claimed by these enemies as a mighty supporter of their cause? Or is there anything for which we ought to give more abundant thanksgivings to God, than that His grace is so ably defended by those to whom it is given, against those to whom it is not given, or by whom, when given, it is not accepted, because in the secret and just judgment of God the disposition to accept it is not given to them?<br>
    2. Wherefore, my venerable lord, and holy brother worthy of being received in the love of Christ, although you render a most excellent service when you thus write on this subject to brethren before whom the adversaries are wont to boast themselves of your being their friend, nevertheless, there remains upon you the yet greater duty of seeing not only that those be punished with wholesome severity who dare to prate more openly their declaration of that error, most dangerously hostile to the Christian name, but also that with pastoral vigilance, on behalf of the weaker and simpler sheep of the Lord, most strenuous precautions be used against those who more covertly, indeed, and timidly, but perseveringly, and in whispers, as it were, teach this error, "creeping into houses," as the apostle says, and doing with practised impiety all those other things which are mentioned immediately afterwards in that passage. Nor ought those to be overlooked who under the restraint of fear hide their sentiments under the most profound silence, yet have not ceased to cherish the same perverse opinions as before. For some of their party might be known to you before that pestilence was denounced by the most explicit condemnation of the apostolic see, whom you perceive to have now become suddenly silent; nor can it be ascertained whether they have been really cured of it, otherwise than through their not only forbearing from the utterance of these false dogmas, but also defending the truths which are opposed to their former errors with the same zeal as they used to show on the other side. These are, however, to be more gently dealt with; for what need is there for causing further terror to those whom their silence itself proves to be sufficiently terrified already? At the same time, though they should not be frightened, they should be taught; and in my opinion they may more easily, while their fear of severity assists the teacher of the truth, be so taught that by the Lord's help, after they have learned to understand and love His grace, they may speak out as antagonists of the error which meanwhile they dare not confess.<br>

                        LETTER CXCII. (A.D. 418.)<br>
	TO MY VENERABLE LORD AND HIGHLY ESTEEMED AND HOLY BROTHER, CAELESTINE,3 AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
    I. I was at a considerable distance from home when the letter of your Holiness addressed to me at Hippo arrived by the hands of the clerk Projectus. When I had returned home, and, having read your letter, felt myself to be owing you a reply, I was still waiting for some means of communicating with you, when, lo! a most desirable opportunity presented itself in the departure of our very dear brother the acolyte Albinus, who leaves us immediately. Rejoicing, therefore, in your health, which is most earnestly desired by me, I return to your Holiness the salutation which I was owing. But I always owe<br>
<br>
556<br>
<br>
you love, the only debt which, even when it has been paid, holds him who has paid it a debtor still. For it is given when it is paid, but it is owing even after it has been given, for there is no time at which it ceases to be due. Nor when it is given is it lost, but it is rather multiplied by giving it; for in possessing it, not in parting with it, it is given. And since it cannot be given unless it is possessed, so neither can it be possessed unless it is given; nay, at the very time when it is given by a man it increases in that man, and, according to the number of persons to whom it is given, the amount of it which is gained becomes greater. Moreover, how can that be denied to friends which is due even to enemies? To enemies, however, this debt is paid with caution, whereas to friends it is repaid with confidence. Nevertheless, it uses every effort to secure that it receives back what it gives, even in the case of those to whom it renders good for evil. For we wish to have as a friend the man whom, as an enemy, we truly love, for we do not sincerely love him unless we wish him to be good, which he cannot be until he be delivered from the sin of cherished enmities.<br>
    2. Love, therefore, is not paid away in the same manner as money; for, whereas money is diminished, love is increased by paying it away. They differ also in this, -- that we give evidence of greater goodwill to the man to whom we may have given money if we do not seek to have it returned; but no one can be a true donor of love unless he lovingly insist on its repayment. For money, when it is received, accrues to him to whom it is given, but forsakes him by whom it is given; love, on the contrary, even when it is not repaid, nevertheless increases with the man who insists on its repayment by the person whom he loves; and not only so, but the person by whom it is returned to him does not begin to possess it till he pays it back again.<br>
    Wherefore, my lord and brother, I willingly give to you, and joyfully receive from you, the love which we owe to each other. The love which I receive I still claim, and the love which I give I still owe. For we ought to obey with docility the precept of the One Master, whose disciples we both profess to be, when He says to us by His apostle: "Owe no man anything, but to love one another."<br>

TO HIS HOLY LORD AND MOST BLESSED FATHER,2 AUGUSTIN, JEROME SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    At all times I have esteemed your Blessedness with becoming reverence and honour, and have loved the Lord and Saviour dwelling in you. But now we add, if possible, something to that which has already reached a climax, and we heap up what was already full, so that we do not suffer a single hour to pass without the mention of your name, because you have, with the ardour of unshaken faith, stood your ground against opposing storms, and preferred, so far as this was in your power, to be delivered from Sodom, though you should come forth alone, rather than linger behind with those who are doomed to perish. Your wisdom apprehends what I mean to say. Go on and prosper! You are renowned throughout the whole world; Catholics revere and look up to you as the restorer of the ancient faith, and -- which is a token of yet more illustrious glory -- all heretics abhor you. They persecute me also with equal hatred, seeking by imprecation to take away the life which they cannot reach with the sword. May the mercy of Christ the Lord preserve you in safety and mindful of me, my venerable lord and most blessed father."3<br>

LETTER CCI. (A.D. 419.) THE EMPERORS HONORIUS AUGUSTUS AND THEODOSIUS AUGUSTUS TO BISHOP AURELIUS SEND GREETING.<br>
<br>
    1. It had been indeed long ago decreed that Pelagius and Celestius, the authors of an execrable heresy, should, as pestilent corruptors of the Catholic truth, be expelled from the city of Rome, lest they should, by their baneful influence, pervert the minds of the ignorant. In this our clemency followed up the judgment of your Holiness, according to which it is beyond all question that they were unanimously condemned after an impartial examination of their opinions. Their obstinate persistence in the offence having, however, made it necessary to issue the decree a second time, we have enacted further by a recent edict, that if any one, knowing that they are concealing themselves in any part of the provinces, shall delay either to drive them out or to inform on them, he, as an accomplice, shall be liable to the punishment prescribed.<br>
    2. To secure, however, the combined efforts of the Christian zeal of all men for the destruction of this preposterous heresy, it will be proper, most dearly beloved father, that the authority of<br>
<br>
557<br>
<br>
your Holiness be applied to the correction of certain bishops, who either support the evil reasonings of these men by their silent consent, or abstain from assailing them with open opposition. Let your Reverence, then, by suitable writings, cause all bishops to be admonished (as soon as they shall know, by the order of your Holiness, that this order is laid upon them) that whoever shall, through impious obstinacy, neglect to vindicate the purity of their doctrine by subscribing the condemnation of the persons before mentioned, shall, after being punished by the loss of their episcopal office, be cut off by excommunication and banished for life from their sees. For as, by a sincere confession of the truth, we ourselves, in obedience to the Council of Nice, worship God as the Creator of all things, and as the Fountain of our imperial sovereignty, your Holiness will not suffer the members of this odious sect, inventing, to the injury of religion, notions new and strange, to hide in writings privately circulated an error condemned by public authority. For, most beloved and loving father, the guilt of heresy is in no degree less grievous in those who either by dissimulation lend the error their secret support, or by abstaining from denouncing it extend to it a fatal approbation.<br>

	TO THE BISHOPS ALYPIUS AND AUGUSTIN, MY LORDS TRULY HOLY, AND DESERVEDLY LOVED AND REVERENCED, JEROME SENDS GREETING IN CHRIST.<br>
    CHAP. I. -- 1. The holy presbyter Innocentius, who is the bearer of this letter, did not last year take with him a letter from me to your Eminences, as he had no expectation of returning to Africa. We thank God, however, that it so happened, as it afforded you an opportunity of overcoming [evil with good in requiting] our silence by your letter. Every opportunity of writing to you, revered fathers, is most acceptable to me. I call God to witness that, if it were possible, I would take the wings of a dove and fly to be folded in your embrace. Loving you, indeed, as I have always done, from a deep sense of your worth, but now especially because your co-operation and your leadership have succeeded in strangling the heresy of Celestius, a heresy which has so poisoned the hearts of many, that, though they felt they were vanquished and condemned, yet they did not lay aside their venomous sentiments, and, as the only thing that remained in their power, hated us by whom they imagined that they had lost the liberty of teaching heretical doctrines.<br>
    CHAP. II. -- 2. As to your inquiry whether I have written in opposition to the books of Annianus, this pretended deacon2 of Celedae, who is amply provided for in order that he may furnish frivolous accounts of the blasphemies of others, know that I received these books, sent in loose sheets by our holy brother, the presbyter Eusebius, not long ago. Since then I have suffered so much through the attacks of disease, and through the falling asleep of your distinguished and holy daughter Eustochium, that I almost thought of passing over these writings with silent contempt. For he flounders from beginning to end in the same mud, and, with the exception of some jingling phrases which are not original, says nothing he had not said before. Nevertheless, I have gained much in the fact, that in attempting to answer my letter he has declared his opinions with less reserve, and has published to all men his blasphemies; for every error which he disowned in the wretched synod of Diospolis he in this treatise openly avows. It is indeed no great thing to answer his superlatively silly puerilities, but if the Lord spare me, and I have a sufficient staff of amanuenses, I will in a few brief lucubrations answer him, not to refute a defunct heresy, but to silence his ignorance and blasphemy by arguments: and this your Holiness could do better than I, as you would relieve me from the necessity of praising my own works in writing to the heretic. Our holy daughters Albina and Melania, and our son Pinianus, salute you cordially. I give to our holy presbyter Innocentius this short letter to convey to you from the holy place Bethlehem. Your niece Paula piteously entreats you to remember her, and salutes you warmly. May the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve you safe and mindful of me, my lords truly holy, and fathers deservedly loved and reverenced.<br>

<br>
	TO MY NOBLE LORD AND MOST EXCELLENT AND LOVING SON, LARGUS, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    I received the letter of your Excellency, in which you ask me to write to you. This assuredly you would not have done unless you had esteemed acceptable and pleasant that which you suppose me capable of writing to you.<br>
<br>
558<br>
<br>
other words, I assume that, having desired the vanities of this life when you had not tried them, now, after the trial has been made, you despise them, because in them the pleasure is deceitful, the labour fruitless, the anxiety perpetual, the elevation dangerous. Men seek them at first through imprudence, and give them up at last with disappointment and remorse. This is true of all the things which, in the cares of this mortal life, are coveted with more eagerness than wisdom by the uneasy solicitude of the men of the world. But it is wholly otherwise with the hope of the pious: very different is the fruit of their labours, very different the reward of their dangers. Fear and grief, and labour and danger are unavoidable, so long as we live in this world; but the great question is, for what cause, with what expectation, with what aim a man endures these things. When, indeed, I contemplate the lovers of this world, I know not at what time wisdom can most opportunely attempt their moral improvement; for when they have apparent prosperity, they reject disdainfully her salutary admonitions, and regard them as old wives fables; when, again, they are in adversity, they think rather of escaping merely from present suffering than of obtaining the real remedy by which they may be made whole, and may arrive at that place where they shall be altogether exempt from suffering. Occasionally, however, some open their ears and hearts to the truth, -- rarely in prosperity, more frequently in adversity. These are indeed the few, for such it is predicted that they shall be. Among these I desire you to be, because I love you truly, my noble lord and most excellent and loving son. Let this counsel be my answer to your letter, because though I am unwilling that you should henceforth suffer such things as you have endured, yet I would grieve still more if you were found to have suffered these things without any change for the better in your life.<br>
<br>
                       LETTER CCVIII. (A.D. 423.)<br>
<br>
	TO THE LADY FELICIA, HIS DAUGHTER IN THE FAITH, AND WORTHY OF HONOUR AMONG THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. I do not doubt, when I consider both your faith and the weakness or wickedness of others, that your mind has been disturbed, for even a holy apostle, full of compassionate love, confesses a similiar experience, saying, "Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?" Wherefore, as I myself share your pain, and am solicitous for your welfare in Christ, I have thought it my duty to address this letter, partly consolatory, partly hortatory, to your Holiness, because in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, in which all His members are one, you are very closely related to us, being loved as an honourable member in that body, and partaking with us of life in His Holy Spirit.<br>
    2. I exhort you, therefore, not to be too much troubled by those offences which for this very reason were foretold as destined to come, that when they came we might remember that they had been foretold, and not be greatly disconcerted by them. For the Lord Himself in His gospel foretold them, saying, "Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe unto that man by whom the offence cometh!" These are the men of whom the apostle said, "They seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's." There are, therefore, some who hold the honourable office of shepherds in order that they may provide for the flock of Christ; others occupy that position that they may enjoy the temporal honours and secular advantages connected with the office. It must needs happen that these two kinds of pastors, some dying, others succeeding them, should continue in the Catholic Church even to the end of time, and the judgment of the Lord. If, then, in the times of the apostles there were men such that Paul, grieved by their conduct, enumerates among his trials, "perils among false brethren," and yet he did not haughtily cast them out, but patiently bore with them, how much more must such arise in our times, since the Lord most plainly says concerning this age which is drawing to a close, "that because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold." The word which follows, however, ought to console and exhort us, for He adds, "He that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved."<br>
    3. Moreover, as there are good shepherds and bad shepherds, so also in flocks there are good and bad. The good are represented by the name of sheep, but the bad are called goats: they feed, nevertheless, side by side in the same pastures, until the Chief Shepherd, who is called the One Shepherd, shall come and separate them one from another according to His promise, "as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats." On us He has laid the duty of gathering the flock; to Himself He has reserved the work of final separation, because it pertains properly to Him who cannot err. For those presumptuous servants, who have lightly ventured to separate before the time which the Lord has reserved in His own hand, have, instead of<br>
559<br>
<br>
separating others, only been separated themselves from Catholic unity; for how could those have a clean flock who have by schism become unclean ?<br>
    4. In order, therefore, that we may remain in the unity of the faith, and not, stumbling at the offences occasioned by the chaff, desert the threshing-floor of the Lord, but rather remain as wheat till the final winnowing,1 and by the love which imparts stability to us bear with the beaten straw our great Shepherd in the gospel admonishes us concerning the good shepherds, that we should not, on account of their good works. place our hope in them, but glorify our heavenly Father for making them such; and concerning the bad shepherds (whom He designed to point out under the name of Scribes and Pharisees), He reminds us that they teach that which is good though they do that which is evil.1<br>
    5. Concerning the good shepherds He thus speaks: "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven." 2 Concerning the bad shepherds He admonishes the sheep in these words: "The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do. not ye after their works: for they say, and do not."3 When these are listened to, the sheep of Christ, even through evil teachers, hear His voice, and do not forsake the unity of His flock, because the good which they hear them teach belongs not to the shepherds but to HIm, and therefore the sheep are safely fed, since even under bad shepherds they are nourished in the Lord's pastures. They do not, however, imitate the actions of the bad shepherds, because such actions belong not to the world but to the shepherds themselves. In regard, however, to those whom they see to be good shepherds, they not only hear the good things which they teach, but also imitate the good actions which they perform. Of this number was the apostle, who said: "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."4 He was a light kindled by the Eternal Light, the LOrd Jesus Christ Himself, and was placed on a candlestick because He gloried in His cross, concerning which he said: "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."5 Moreover, since he sought not his own things, but the things which are Jesus Christ's, whilst he exhorts to the imitation of his own life those whom he had "begotten through the gospel,"6 he yet severely reproved those who, by the names of apostles, introduced schisms, and he chides those who said, "I am of Paul; was Paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?" 7<br>
    6. Hence we understand both that the good shepherds are those who seek not their own, but the things of Jesus Christ, and that the good sheep, though imitating the works of the good shepherds by whose ministry they have been gathered together, do not place their hope in them, but rather in the Lord, by Whose blood they are redeemed; so that when they may happen to be placed under bad shepherds, preaching Christ's doctrine and doing their own evil works, they will do what they teach, but will not do what they do, and will not, on account of these sons of wickedness, forsake the pastures of the one true Church. For there are both good and bad in the Catholic Church, which, unlike the Donatist sect, is extended and spread abroad, not in Africa only, but through all nations; as the apostle expresses it, "bringing forth fruit, and increasing in the whole world." 8 But those who are separated from the Church, as long as they are opposed to it cannot be good; although an apparently praiseworthy conversation seems to prove some of them to be good, their separation from the Church itself renders them bad, according to the saying of the Lord: "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth."9<br>
    7. Therefore, my daughter, worthy of all welcome and honour among the members of Christ, I exhort you to hold faithfully that which the Lord has committed to you, and love with all your heart Him and His Church who suffered you not, by joining yourself with the lost, to lose the recompense of your virginity, or perish with them. For if you should depart out of this world separated from the unity of the body of Christ, it will avail you nothing to have preserved inviolate your virginity. But God, who is rich in mercy, has done in regard to you that which is written in the gospel: when the invited guests excused themselves to the master of the feast, he said to the servants, "Go ye, therefore, into the highways and hedges, and as many as ye shall find compel them to come in." 10 Although, however, you owe sincerest affection to those good servants of His through whose instrumentality you were compelled to come in, yet it is your duty,<br>
<br>
560<br>
<br>
nevertheless, to place your hope on Him who prepared the banquet, by whom also you have been persuaded to come to eternal and blessed life. Committing to Him your heart, your vow, and your sacred virginity, and your faith, hope, and charity, you will not be moved by offences, which shall abound even to the end; but, by the unshaken strength of piety, shall be safe and shall triumph in the Lord, continuing in the unity of His body even to the end. Let me know, by your answer, with what sentiments you regard my anxiety for you, to which I have to the best of my ability given expression in this letter. May the grace and mercy of God ever protect you !<br>
<br>
LETTER CCIX.<br>
<br>
(A.D. 423.)<br>
TO CAELESTINE,1 MY LORD MOST BLESSED, AND<br>
	HOLY FATHER VENERATED WITH ALL DUE AFFECTION, AUGUSTIN SENDS    GREETING IN THELORD.<br>
<br>
    1. First of all I congratulate you that our Lord God has, as we have heard, established you in the illustrious chair which you occupy without any division among His people. In the next place, I lay before your Holiness the state of affairs with us, that not only by your prayers, but with your council and aid you may help us. For I write to you at this time under deep affliction, because, while wishing to benefit certain members of Christ in our neighbourhood, I brought on them a great calamity by my want of prudence and caution.<br>
    2. Bordering on the district of Hippo, there is a small town,2 named Fussala: formerly there was no bishop there, but, along with the contiguous district, it was included in the parish of Hippo. That part of the country had few Catholics; the error of the Donatists held under its miserable influence all the other congregations located in the midst of a large population, so that in the town of Fussala itself there was not one Catholic. In the mercy of God, all these places were brought to attach themselves to the unity of the Church; with how much toil, and how many dangers it would take long to tell, -- how the presbyters originally appointed by us to gather these people into the fold were robbed, beaten, maimed, deprived of their eyesight, and even put to death; whose sufferings, however, were not useless and unfruitful, seeing that by them the re-establishment of unity was achieved. But as Fussala is forty miles distant from Hippo, and I saw that in governing its people, and gathering together the remnant, however small, of persons of both sexes, who, not threatening others, but fleeing for their own safety, were scattered here and there, my work would be extended farther than it ought, and that I could not give the attention which I clearly perceived to be necessary, I arranged that a bishop should be ordained and appointed there.<br>
	3. With a view to the carrying out of this, I sought for a person who might be suitable to the locality and people, and at the same time acquainted with the Punic language; and I had in my mind a presbyter fitted for the office. Having applied by letter to the holy senior bishop who was then Primate of Numidia, I obtained his consent to come from a great distance to ordain this presbyter. After his coming, when all our minds were intent on an affair of so great consequence, at the last moment, the person whom I believed to be ready to be ordained disappointed us by absolutely refusing to accept the office. Then I myself, who, as the event showed, ought rather to have postponed than precipitated a matter .so perilous, being unwilling that the very venerable and holy old man, who had come  with so much fatigue to us, should return home without accomplishing the business for which he had journeyed so far, offered to the people, without their seeking him, a young man, Antonius, who was then with me. He had been from childhood brought up in a monastery by us, but, beyond officiating as a reader, he had no experience of the labours pertaining to the various degrees of rank in the clerical office. The unhappy people, not knowing what was to follow, submissively trusting me, accepted him on my suggestion. What need I say more? The deed was done; he entered on his office as their bishop.<br>
  4. What shall I do? I am unwilling to accuse before your venerable Dignity one whom I brought into the fold, and nourished with care; and I am unwilling to forsake those in seeking whose ingathering to the Church I have travailed, amid fears and anxieties; and how to do justice to both I cannot discover. The matter has come to such a painful crisis, that those who, in compliance with my wishes, had, in the belief that they were consulting their own interests, chosen him for their bishop, are now bringing charges against him before me. When the most serious of these, namely, charges of gross immorality, which were brought forward not by those whose bishop he was, but by certain other individuals, were found to be utterly unsupported by evidence, and he seemed to us fully acquitted of the crimes laid most ungenerously to his charge, he was on this account regarded, both by ourselves and by others, with such sympathy that<br>
<br>
561<br>
<br>
the things complained of by the people of Fussala and the surrounding district,-- such as intolerable tyranny and spoliation, and extortion, and oppression of various kinds,-- by no means seemed so grievous that for one, or for all of them taken together, we should deem it necessary to deprive him of the office of bishop; it seemed to us enough to insist that he should restore what might be proved to have been taken away unjustly.<br>
    5. In fine, we so mixed clemency with severity in our sentence, that while reserving to him his office of bishop, we did not leave altogether unpunished offences which behoved neither to be repeated again by himself, nor held forth to the imitation of others. We therefore, in correcting him, reserved to the young man the rank of his office unimpaired, but at the same time, as a punishment, we took away his power, appointing that he should not any longer rule over those with whom he had dealt in such a manner that with just resentment they could not submit to his authority, and might perhaps manifest their impatient indignation by breaking forth into some deeds of violence fraught with danger both to themselves and to him. That this was the state of feeling evidently appeared when the bishops dealt with them concerning Antonius, although at present that conspicuous man Color, of whose powerful interference against him he complained, possesses no power, either in Africa or elsewhere.<br>
    6. But why should I detain you with further particulars? I beseech you to assist us in this laborious matter, blessed lord and holy father, venerated for your piety, and revered with due affection; and command all the documents which have been forwarded to be read aloud to you. Observe in what manner Antonius discharged his duties as bishop; how, when debarred. from communion until full restitution should be made to the men of Fussala, he submitted to our sentence, and has now set apart a sum out of which to pay what may after inquiry be deemed just for compensation, in order that the privilege of communion might be restored to him; with what crafty reasoning he prevailed on our aged primate, a most venerable man, to believe all his statements, and to recommend him as altogether blameless to the venerable Pope Boniface. But why should I rehearse all the rest, seeing that the venerable old man, aforesaid must have reported the entire matter to your Holiness ?<br>
    7. In the numerous minutes of procedure in which our judgment regarding him is recorded, I should have feared that we might appear to you to have passed a sentence less severe than we ought to have done, did I not know that you are so prone to mercy that you will deem it your duty to spare not us only, because we spared him, but also the man himself. But what we did, whether in kindness or laxity, he attempts to turn to account, and use as a legal objection to our sentence. He boldly protests: "Either I ought to sit in my own episcopal chair, or ought not to be a bishop at all," as if he were now sitting in any seat but his own. For, on this very account, those places were set apart and assigned to him in which he had previously been bishop, that he might not be said to be unlawfully translated to another see, contrary to the statutes of the Fathers;1 or is it to be maintained that one ought to be so rigid an advocate, either for severity or for lenity, as to insist, either that no punishment be inflicted on those who seem not to deserve deposition from the office of bishop, or that the sentence of deposition be pronounced on all who seem to deserve any punishment ?<br>
    8. There are cases on record, in which the Apostolic See, either pronouncing judgment or confirming the judgment of others, sanctioned decisions by which persons, for certain offences, were neither deposed from their episcopal office nor left altogether unpunished. I shall not bring forward those which occurred at a period very remote from our own time; I shall mention recent instances. Let Priscus, a bishop of the province of Caesarea, protest boldly: "Either the office of primate should be open to me, as to other bishops, or I ought not to remain a bishop." Let Victor, another bishop of the same province, with whom, when involved in the same sentence as Priscus, no bishop beyond his own diocese holds communion, let him, I say, protest with similar confidence: "Either I ought to have communion everywhere, or I ought not to have it in my own district." Let Laurentius, a third bishop of the same province, speak, and in the precise words of this man he may exclaim: "Either I ought to sit in the chair to which I have been ordained, or I ought not to be a bishop." But who can find fault with these judgments, except one who does not consider that, neither on the one hand ought all offences to be left unpunished, nor on the other ought all to be punished in one way.<br>
    9. Since, then, the most blessed Pope Boniface, speaking of Bishop Antonius, has in his epistle, with the vigilant caution becoming a pastor, inserted in his judgment the additional clause, "if he has faithfully narrated the facts of the case to us," receive now the facts of the case, which in his statement to you he passed over in silence, and also the transactions which took place after the letter of that man of blessed memory had been read in Africa, and in the mercy of Christ extend your aid to men implor-<br>
<br>

<br>
ing it more earnestly than he does from whose turbulence they desire to be freed. For either from himself, or at least from very frequent rumors, threats are held out that the courts of justiciary, and the public authorities, and the violence of the military, are to carry into force the decision of the Apostolic See; the effect of which is that these unhappy men, being now Catholic Christians, dread greater evils from a Catholic bishop than those which, when they were heretics, they dreaded from the laws of Catholic emperors. Do not permit these things to be done, I implore you, by the blood of Christ, by the memory of the Apostle Peter, who has warned those placed over Chistian people against violently "lording it over their brethren."1 I commend to the gracious love of your Holiness the Catholics of Fussala, my children in Christ, and also Bishop Antonius, my son in Christ, for I love both, and I commend both to you. I do not blame the people of Fussala for bringing to your ears their just complaint against me for imposing on them a man whom I had not proved, and who was in age at least not yet established, by whom they have been so afflicted; nor do I wish any wrong done to Antonius, whose evil covetousness I oppose with a determination proportioned to my sincere affection for him. Let your compassion be extended to both, -- to them, so that they may not suffer evil; to him, so that he may not do evil: to them, so that they may not hate the Catholic Church, if they find no aid in defence against a Catholic bishop extended to them by Catholic bishops, and especially by the Apostolic See itself; to him, on the other hand, so that he may not involve himself in such grievous wickedness as to alienate from Christ those whom against their will he endeavours to make his own.<br>
    10. As for myself, I must acknowledge to your Holiness, that in the danger which threatens both, I am so racked with anxiety and grief that I think of retiring from the responsibilities of the episcopal office, and abandoning myself to demonstrations of sorrow corresponding to the greatness of my error, if I shall see (through the conduct of him in favour of whose election to the bishopric I imprudently gave my vote)  the Church of God laid waste, and (which may God forbid) even perish, involving in its destruction the man by whom it was laid waste. Recollecting what the apostle says: "If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."2 I will judge myself, that He may spare me who is hereafter to judge the quick and the dead. If, however, you succeed in restoring the members of Christ in that district from their deadly fear and grief, and in comforting my old age by the administration of justice tempered with mercy, He who brings deliverance to us through you in this tribulation, and who has established you in the seat which you occupy, shall recompense unto you good for good, both in this life and in that which is to come.<br>

<br>
	TO THE MOST BELOVED AND MOST HOLY MOTHER FELICITAS,3 AND BROTHER RUSTICUS, AND TO THE SISTERS WHO ARE WITH THEM, AUGUSTIN AND THOSE WHO ARE WITH HIM SEND GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. Good is the Lord, and to every place extends His mercy, which comforts us by your love to us in Him. How much He loves those It who believe and hope in Him, and who both love Him and love one another, and what blessings He keeps in store for them hereafter, He proves most remarkably in this, that on the unbelieving, the abandoned, and the perverse, whom He threatens with eternal fire, if they persevere in their evil disposition to the end, He does in this life bestow so many benefits, making "His sun to rise on the evil and on the good," "on the just and on the unjust,"4 words in which, for the sake of brevity, some instances are mentioned that many more may be suggested to reflection; for who can reckon up how many gracious benefits the wicked receive in this life from Him whom they despise? Amongst these, this is one of great value, that by the experience of the occasional afflictions, which like  good physician He mingles the pleasures of this life, He admonishes them, if only they will give heed, to flee from the wrath to come, and while they are in the way, that is, in this life, to agree with the word of God, which they have made an adversary to themselves by their wicked lives. What, then, is not bestowed in mercy on men by the Lord God, since even affliction sent by Him is a blessing ? For prosperity is a gift of God when He comforts, adversity a gift of God when He warns; and ff He bestows these things, as I have said, even on the wicked, what does He prepare for those who bear with one another? Into this number you rejoice that through His grace you have been gathered, "forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."5 For there shall not be awanting occasion for<br>
<br>
563<br>
<br>
your bearing one with another till God shall have so purified you, that, death being "swallowed up in victory,"1 "God shall be all in all."2<br>
   2. We ought never, indeed, to take pleasure in quarrels; but however averse we may be to them, they occasionally either arise from love, or put it to the test. For how difficult is it to find any one willing to bc reproved; and where is the wise man of whom it is said, "Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee"?3 But are we on that account not to reprove and find fault with a brother, to prevent him from going down through false security to death ? For it is a common and frequent experience, that when a brother is found fault with he is mortified at the time, and resists and contradicts his friend, but afterwards reconsiders the matter in silence alone with God, where he is not afraid of giving offence to men by submitting to correction, but is afraid of offending God by refusing to be reformed, and thenceforward refrains from doing that for which he has been justly reproved; and in proportion as he hates his sin, he loves the brother whom he feels to have been the enemy of his sin. But if he belong to the number of those of whom it is said, "Reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee," 3 the quarrel does not arise from love on the part of the reproved, but it exercises and tests the love of the reprover; for he does not return hatred for hatred, but the love which constrains him to find fault endures unmoved, even when he who is found fault with requites it with hatred. But if the reprover renders evil for evil to the man who takes offence at being reproved, he was not worthy to reprove another, but evidently deserves to be himself reproved. Act upon these principles, so that either quarrels may not arise, or, if they do arise, may quickly terminate in peace. Be more earnest to dwell in concord than to vanquish each other in controversy. For as vinegar corrodes a vessel if it remain long in it, so anger corrodes the heart if it is cherished till the morrow. These things, therefore, observe, and the God of peace shall be with you. Pray also unitedly for us, that we may cheerfully practise the good advices which we give to you.<br>

                       LETTER CCXI. (A.D. 423.)<br>
<br>
IN THIS LETTER AUGUSTIN REBUKES THE NUNS OF THE MONASTERY IN WHICH HIS SISTER HAD BEEN PRIORESS, FOR CERTAIN TURBULENT MANIFESTATIONS OF DISSATISFACTION WITH HER SUCCESSOR, AND LAYS DOWN GENERAL RULES FOR THEIR GUIDANCE.4<br>
<br>
    1. As severity is ready to punish the faults which it may discover, so charity is reluctant to discover the faults which it must punish. This was the reason of my not acceding to your request for a visit from me, at a time when, if I had come, I must have come not to rejoice in your harmony, but to add more vehemence to your strife. For how could I have treated your behaviour with indifference, or have allowed it to pass unpunished, if so great a tumult had arisen among you in my presence, as that which, when I was absent, assailed my ears with the din of your voices, although my eyes did not witness your disorder ? For perhaps your rising against authority would have been even more violent in my presence, since I must have refused the concessions which you demanded,-- concessions involving, to your own disadvantage, some most dangerous precedents, subversive of sound discipline; and I must thus have found you such as I did not desire, and must have myself been found by you such as you did not desire.<br>
    2. The apostle, writing to the Corinthians, says: "Moreover, I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth. Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy."5 I also say the same to you; to spare you I have not come to you. I have also spared myself, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow, and have chosen not to see you face to face, but to pour out my heart to God on your behalf, and to plead the cause of your great danger not in words before you, but in tears before God; entreating Him that He may not turn into grief the joy wherewith I am wont to rejoice in you, and that amid the great offences with which this world everywhere abounds, I may be comforted at times by thinking of your number, your pure affection, your holy conversation, and the abundant grace of God which is given to you, so that you not only have renounced matrimony, but have chosen to dwell with one accord in fellowship under the same roof, that you may have one soul and one heart in God.<br>
    3. When I reflect on these good things, these gifts of God in you, my heart, amid the many storms by which it is agitated through evils elsewhere, is wont to find perfect rest. "Ye did run well; who did hinder you, that ye should not obey the truth ? This persuasion cometh not of Him that calleth you." 6 "A little leaven "--7<br>
<br>
564<br>
<br>
I am unwilling to complete the sentence, for I rather desire, entreat, and exhort that the leaven itself be transformed into something better, lest it change the whole lump for the worse, as it has already almost done. If, therefore, you have begun to put forth again the buddings of a sound discernment as to your duty, pray that you enter not into temptation, nor fall again into strifes, emulations, animosities, divisions, evil speaking, seditions, whisperings. For we have not laboured as we have done in planting and watering the garden of the Lord among you, that we may reap these thorns from you. If, however, your weakness be still disturbed by turbulence, pray that you may be delivered from this temptation. As for the troublers of your peace, if such there be still among you, they shall, unless they amend their conduct, bear their judgment, whoever they be.<br>
    4. Consider how evil a thing it is, that at the very time when we rejoice in the return of the Donatists to our unity, we have to lament internal discord within our monastery. Be stedfast in observing your good vows, and you will not desire to change for another the prioress whose care of the monastery has been for so many years unwearied, under whom also you have both increased in numbers and advanced in age, and who has given you the place in her heart which a mother gives to her own children. All of you when you came to the monastery found her there, either discharging satisfactorily the duties of assistant to the late holy prioress, my sister, or, after her own accession to that office, giving you a welcome to the sisterhood. Under her you spent your noviciate, under her you took the veil, under her your number has been multiplied, and yet you are riotously demanding that she should be replaced by another, whereas, if the proposal to put another in her place had come from us, it would have been seemly for you to have mourned over such a proposal. For she is one whom you know well; to her you came at first, and under her you have for so many years advanced in age and in numbers. No official previously unknown to you has been appointed, excepting the prior; if it be on his account that you seek a change, and if through aversion to him you thus rebel against your mother, why do you not rather petition for his removal? If, however, you recoil from this suggestion, for I know how you reverence and love him in Christ, why do you not all the more for his sake reverence and love her ? For the first measures of the recently appointed prior in presiding over you are so hindered by your disorderly behaviour, that he is himself disposed to leave you, rather than be subjected on your account to the dishonour and odium which must arise from the report going abroad, that you would not have sought another prioress unless you had be un to have him as your prior. May God therefore calm and compose your minds: let not the work of the devil prevail in you, but may the peace of Christ gain the victory in your hearts; and do not rush headlong to death, either through vexation of spirit, because what you desire is refused, or through shame, because of having desired what you ought not to have desired, but rather by repentance resume the conscientious discharge of duty; and imitate not the repentance of Judas the traitor, but the tears of Peter the shepherd.&nbsp;<br>
  5. The rules which we lay down to be observed by you as persons settled in a monastery are these: --<br>
First of all, in order to fulfil the end for which you have been gathered into one community, dwell in the house with oneness of spirit, and let your hearts and minds be one in God. Also call not anything the property of any one, but let all things be common property, and let distribution of food and raiment be made to each of you by the prioress, -- not equally to all, because you are not all equally strong, but to every one according to her need. For you read in the Acts of the Apostles: "They had all things common: and distribution was made to every man according as he had need."1 Let those who had any worldly goods when they entered the monastery cheerfully desire that these become common property. Let those who had no worldly goods not ask within the monastery for luxuries which they could not have while they were outside of its walls; nevertheless, let the comforts which the infirmity of any of them may require be given to such, though their poverty before coming in to the monastery may have been such that they could not have procured for themselves the bare necessaries of life; and let them in such case be careful not to reckon it the chief happiness of their present lot that they have found within the  monastery food and raiment, such as was elsewhere beyond their reach.    6. Let them, moreover, not hold their heads high because they are associated on terms of equality with persons whom they durst not have approached in the outer world; but let them rather lift their hearts on high, and not seek after earthly possessions, lest, if the rich be made lowly but the poor puffed up with vanity in our monasteries, these institutions become useful only to the rich, and hurtful to the poor. On the other hand, however, let not those who seemed to hold some position in the world regard with contempt their sisters, who in coming into this sacred fellowship have left a condition of poverty; let them be careful to glory rather in<br>
<br>
565<br>
<br>
the fellowship of their poor sisters, than in the rank of their wealthy parents. And let them not lift themselves up above the rest because of their having, perchance, contributed something from their own resources to the maintenance of the community, lest they find in their riches more occasion for pride, because they divide them with others in a monastery, than they might have found if they had spent them in their own enJoyment in the world. For every other kind of sin finds scope in evil works, so that by it they are done, but pride lurks even in good works, so that by it they are undone; and what avails it to lavish money on the poor, and become poor oneself, if the unhappy soul is rendered more proud by despising riches than it had been by possessing them ? Live, then, all of you, in unanimity and concord, and in each other give honour to that God whose temples you have been made.<br>
    7. Be regular (instate) in prayers at the appointed hours and times. In the oratory let no one do anything else than the duty for which the place was made, and from which it has received its name; so that if any of you, having leisure, wish to pray at other hours than those appointed, they may not be hindered by others using the place for any other purpose. In the psalms and hymns used in your prayers to God, let that be pondered in the heart which is uttered by the voice; chant nothing but what you find prescribed to be chanted; whatever is not so prescribed is not to be chanted.<br>
    8. Keep the flesh under by fastings and by abstinence from meat and drink, so far as health allows. When any one is not able to fast, let her not, unless she be ill, take any nourishment except at the customary hour of repast. From the lime of your coming to table until you rise from it, listen without noise and wrangling to whatever may be in course read to you; let not your mouths alone be exercised in receiving food, let your ears be also occupied in receiving the word of God.<br>
    9. If those who are weak in consequence of their early training are treated somewhat differently in regard to food, this ought not to be vexatious or seem unjust to others whom a different training has made more robust. And let them not esteem these weaker ones more favoured than themselves, because they receive a fare somewhat less frugal than their own, but rather congratulate themselves on enjoying a vigour of constitution which the others do not possess. And if to those who have entered the monastery  after a more delicate upbringing at home, there be given any food, clothing, couch, or covering which to others who are stronger, and in that respect more favourably circumstanced, is not given, the sisters to whom these indulgences are not given ought to consider how great a descent the others have made from their style of living in the world to that which they now have, although they may not have been able to come altogether down to the severe simplicity of others who have a more hardy constitution. And when those who were originally more wealthy see  others receiving -- not as mark of higher honour, but out of consideration for infirmity -- more largely than they do themselves, they ought not to be disturbed by fear of any such detestable perversion of monastic discipline as this, that the poor are to be trained to luxury in a monastery in which the wealthy are, so far as they can bear it, trained to hardships. For, of course, as those who are ill must take less food, otherwise they would increase their disease, so after illness, those who are convalescent must, in order to their more rapid recovery, be so nursed -- even though they may have come from the lowest poverty to the monastery -- as if their recent illness had conferred on them the same claim for special treatment as their former style of tiring confers upon those who, before entering the i monastery, were rich. So soon, however, as they regain their wonted health, let them return to their own happier mode of living, which, as involving fewer wants, is more suitable for those who are servants of God; and let not inclination detain them when they are strong in that amount of ease to which necessity had raised them when they were weak. Let those regard themselves as truly richer who are endowed with greater strength to bear hardships. For it is better to have fewer wants than to have larger resources.<br>
    10. Let your apparel be in no wise conspicuous; and aspire to please others by your behaviour rather than by your attire. Let your head-dresses not be so thin as to let the nets below them be seen. Let your hair be worn wholly covered, and let it neither be carelessly dishevelled nor too scrupulously arranged when you go beyond the monastery. When you go anywhere, walk together; when you come to the place to which you were going, stand together. In walking, in standing, in deportment, and in all your movements let nothing be done which might attract the improper desires of any one, but rather let all be in keeping with your sacred character. Though a passing glance be directed towards any man, let your eyes look fixedly at none; for when you are walking you are not forbidden to see men, but you must neither let your desires go out to them, nor wish to be the objects of desire on their part. For it is not only by touch that a woman awakens in any man or cherishes towards him such desire, this may be done by inward feelings and by looks. And say not that you have chaste minds though you may have wanton eyes, for a wanton eye is the<br>
<br>
566<br>
<br>
index of a wanton heart. And when wanton hearts exchange signals with each other in looks, though the tongue is silent, and are, by the force of sensual passion, pleased by the reciprocation of inflamed desire, their purity of character is gone, though.their bodies are not defiled by any act of uncleanness. Nor let her who fixes her eyes upon one of the other sex, and takes pleasure in his eye being fixed on her, imagine that the act is not observed by others; she is seen assuredly by those by whom she supposes herself not to be remarked. But even though she should elude notice, and be seen by no human eye, what shall she do with that Witness above us from whom nothing can be concealed? Is He to be regarded as not seeing because His eye rests on all things with a long-suffering proportioned to His wisdom? Let every holy woman guard herself from desiring sinfully to please man by cherishing a fear of displeasing God; let her check the desire of sinfully looking upon man by remembering that God's eye is looking upon all things. For in this very matter we are exhorted to cherish fear of God by the words of Scripture:-- " He that looks with a fixed eye is an abomination to the Lord." 1 When, therefore, you are together in the church, or in any other place where men also are present, guard your chastity by watching over one another, and God, who dwelleth in you, will thus guard you by means of yourselves.<br>
    11. And if you perceive in any one of your number this frowardness of eye, warn her at once, so that the evil which has begun may not go on, but be checked immediately. But if, after this admonition, you see her repeat the offence, or do the same thing on any other subsequent day, whoever may have had the opportunity of seeing this must now report her as one who has been wounded and requires to be healed, but not without pointing her out to another, and perhaps a third sister, so that she may be convicted by the testimony of two or three witnesses,2 and may be reprimanded with necessary severity. And do not think that in thus informing upon one another you are guilty of malevolence. For the truth rather is, that you are not guiltless if by keeping silence you allow sisters to perish, whom you may correct by giving information of their hulls. For if your sister had a wound on her person which she wished to conceal through fear of the surgeon's lance, would it not be cruel if you kept silence about it, and true compassion if you made it known ? How much more, then, are you bound to make known her sin, that she may not suffer more fatally from a neglected spiritual wound. But before she is pointed out to others as witnesses by whom she may be convicted if she deny the charge, the offender ought to be brought before the prioress, if after admonition she has refused to be corrected, so that by her being in this way more privately rebuked, the fault which she has committed may not become known to all the others. If, however, she then deny the charge, then others must be employed to observe her conduct after the denial, so that now before the whole sisterhood she may not be accused by one witness, but convicted by two or three. When convicted of the fault, it is her duty to submit to the corrective discipline which may be appointed by the prioress or the prior. If she refuse to submit to this, and does not go away from you of her own accord, let her be expelled from your society. For this is not done cruelly but mercifully, to protect very many from perishing through infection of the plague with which one has been stricken. Moreover, what I have now said in regard to abstaining from wanton looks should be carefully observed, with due love for the persons and hatred of the sin, in observing, forbidding, reporting, proving, and punishing of all other faults. But if any one among you has gone on into so great sin as to receive secretly from any man letters or gifts of any description, let her be pardoned and prayed for if she confess this of her own accord. If, however, she is found out and is convicted of such conduct, let her be more severely punished, according to the sentence of the prioress, or of the prior, or even of the bishop.<br>
     12. Keep your clothes in one place, under the care of one or two, or as many as may be required to shake them so as to keep them from being injured by moths; and as your food is supplied from one storeroom, let your clothes be provided from one wardrobe. And whatever may be brought out to you as wearing apparel suitable for the season, regard it, if possible, as a matter of no importance whether each of you receives the very same article of clothing which she had formerly laid aside, or one receive what another formerly wore, provided only that what is necessary be denied to no one. But if contentions and murmurings are occasioned among you by this, and some one of you complains that she has received some article of dress inferior to that which she formerly wore, and thinks it beneath her to be so clothed as her other sister was, by this prove your own selves, and judge how far deficient you must be in the inner holy dress of the heart, when you quarrel with each other about the clothing of the body. Nevertheless, if your infirmity is indulged by the concession that you are to receive again the identical article which you had laid aside, let whatever you put past be nevertheless, kept in one place, and in charge of the ordinary keep-<br>
<br>
567<br>
<br>
ers of the wardrobe; it being, of course, understood that no one is to work in making any article of clothing or for the couch, or any girdle, veil, or head-dress, for her own private comfort, but that all your works be done for the common good of all, with greater zeal and more cheerful perseverance than if you were each working for your individual interest. For the love concerning which it is written, "Charity seeketh not her own,"1 is to be understood as that which prefers the common good to personal advantage, not personal advantage to the common good. Therefore the more fully that you give to the common good a preference above your personal and private interests, the more fully will you be sensible of progress in securing that, in regard to all those things which supply wants destined soon to pass away, the charity which abides may hold a conspicuous and influential place. An obvious corollary from these rules is, that when persons of either sex bring to their own daughters in the monastery, or to inmates belonging to them by any other relationship, presents of clothing or of other articles which are to be regarded as necessary, such gifts are not to be received privately, but must be under the control of the prioress, that, being added to the common stock, they may be placed at the service of any inmate to whom they may be necessary. If any one conceal any gift bestowed on her, let sentence be passed on her as guilty of theft.<br>
    13. Let your clothes be washed, whether by yourselves or by washerwomen, at such intervals as are approved by the prioress, lest the indulgence of undue solicitude about spotless raiment produce inward stains upon your souls. Let the washing of the body and the use of baths be not constant, but at the usual interval assigned to it, i.e. once in a month. In the case, however, of illness rendering necessary the washing of the person, let it not be unduly delayed; let it be done on the physician's recommendation without complaint; and even though the patient be reluctant, she must do at the order of the prioress what health demands. If, however, a patient desires the bath, and it happen to be not for her good, her desire must not be yielded to, for sometimes it is supposed to be beneficial because it gives pleasure, although in reality it may be doing harm. Finally, if a handmaid of God suffers from any hidden pain of body, let her statement as to her suffering be believed without hesitation; but if there be any uncertainty whether that which she finds agreeable be really of use in curing her pain, let the physician be consulted. To the baths, or to any place whither it may be necessary to go, let no fewer than three go at any time. Moreover, the sister requiring to go anywhere is not to go with those whom she may choose herself, but with those whom the prioress may order. The care of the sick, and of those who require attention as convalescents, and of those who, without any feverish symptoms, are labouring under debility, ought to be committed to some one of your number, who shall procure for them from the storeroom what she shall see to be necessary for each. Moreover, let those who have charge, whether in the storeroom, or in the wardrobe, or in the library, render service to their sisters without murmuring. Let manuscripts be applied for at a fixed hour every day, and let none who ask them at other hours receive them. But at whatever time clothes and shoes may be required by one in need of these, let not those in charge of this department delay supplying the want.<br>
    14. Quarrels should be unknown among you, or at least, if they arise, they should as quickly as possible be ended, lest anger grow into hatred, and convert "a mote into a beam," 2 and make the soul chargeable with murder. For the saying of Scripture: "He that hateth his brother is a murderer,"3 does not concern men only, but women also are bound by this law through its being enjoined on the other sex, which was prior in the order of creation. Let her, whoever she be, that shall have injured another by taunt or abusive language, or false accusation, remember to remedy the wrong by apology as promptly as possible, and let her who was injured grant forgiveness without further disputation. If the injury has been mutual, the duty of both parties will be mutual forgiveness, because of your prayers, which, as they are more frequent, ought to be all the more sacred in your esteem. But the sister who is prompt in asking another whom she confesses that she has wronged to grant her forgiveness is, though she may be more frequently betrayed by a hasty temper, better than another who, though less irascible, is with more difficulty persuaded to ask forgiveness. Let not her who refuses to forgive her sister expect to receive answers to prayer: as for any sister who never will ask forgiveness, or does not do it from the heart, it is no advantage to such an one to be in a monastery, even though, perchance, she may not be expelled. Wherefore abstain from hard words; but if they have escaped your lips, be not slow to bring words of healing from the same lips by which the wounds were inflicted. When, however, the necessity of discipline compels you to use hard words in restraining the younger inmates, even though you feel that in these you have gone too far, it is not imperative on you to ask their forgiveness, lest<br>
<br>
568<br>
<br>
while undue humility is observed by you towards those who ought to be subject to you, the authority necessary for governing them be impaired ; but pardon must nevertheless be sought from the Lord of all, who knows with what goodwill you love even those whom you reprove it may be with undue severity. The love which you bear to each other must be not carnal, but spiritual: for those things which are practised by immodest women in shameful frolic and sporting with one another ought not even to be done by those of your sex who are married, or are intending to marry, and much more ought not to be done by widows or chaste virgins dedicated to be hand-maids of Christ by a holy vow.<br>
    15. Obey the prioress as a mother, giving her all due honour, that God may not be offended by your forgetting what you owe to her: still more is it incumbent on you to obey the presbyter who has charge of you all. To the prioress most specially belongs the responsibility of seeing that all these rules be observed, and that if any rule has been neglected, the offence be not passed over, but carefully corrected and punished; it being, of course, open to her to refer to the presbyter any matter that goes beyond her province or power. But let her count herself happy not in exercising the power which rules, but in practising the love which serves. In honour in the sight of men let her be raised above you, but in fear in the sight of God let her be as it were beneath your feet. Let her show herself before all a "pattern of good works."1 Let her "warn the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all."2 Let her cheerfully observe and cautiously impose rules. And, though both are necessary, let her be more anxious to be loved than to be feared by you; always reflecting that for you she must give account to God. For this reason yield obedience to her out of compassion not for yourselves only but also for her, because, as she occupies a higher position among you, her danger is proportionately greater than your own.<br>
    16. The Lord grant that you may yield loving submission to all these rules, as persons enamoured of spiritual beauty, and diffusing a sweet savour of Christ by means of a good conversation, not as bondwomen under the law, but as established in freedom under grace. That you may, however, examine yourselves by this Ires.rise as by a mirror, and may not through forgetfulness neglect anything, let it be read over by you once a week; and in so far as you find yourselves practising the things written here, give thanks for this to God, the Giver of all good; in so far, however, as any of you finds herself to be in some particular defective, let her lament the past and be on her guard in the time to come, praying both that her debt may be forgiven, and that she may not be led into temptation.<br>

<br>
	TO QUINTILIANUS, MY LORD MOST BLESSED AND BROTHER AND FELLOW BISHOP DESERVEDLY VENERABLE, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    Venerable father, I commend to you in the love of Christ these honourable servants of God and precious members of Christ, Galla, a widow (who has taken on herself sacred vows), and her daughter Simplicia, a consecrated virgin, who is subject to her mother by reason of her age, but above her by reason of her holiness. We have nourished them as far as we have been able with the word of God; and by this epistle, as if it were with my own hand, I commit them to you, to be comforted and aided in every way which their interest or necessity requires. This duty your Holiness would doubtless have undertaken without any recommendation from me; for if it is our duty on account of the Jerusalem above, of which we are all citizens, and in which they desire to have a place of distinguished holiness, to cherish towards them not only the affection due to fellow-citizens, but even brotherly love, how much stronger is their claim on you, who reside in the same country in this earth in which these ladies, for the love of Christ, renounced the distinctions of this world I also ask you to condescend to receive with the same love with which I have offered it my official salutation, and to remember me in your prayers. These ladies carry with them relics of the most blessed and glorious martyr Stephen: your Holiness knows how to give due honour to these, as we have done.3<br>

<br>
	RECORD, PREPARED BY ST. AUGUSTIN, OF THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE OCCASION OF HIS DESIGNATING ERACLIUS TO SUCCEED HIM IN THE EPISCOPAL CHAIR, AND TO RELIEVE HIM MEANWHILE IN HIS OLD AGE OF A PART OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES.<br>
<br>
	In the Church of Peace in the district of Hippo Regius, on the 26th day of September in the year of the twelfth consulship of the most renowned Theodosius, and of the second consulship of Valentinian Augustus: 4<br>
569<br>
<br>
-- Bishop Augustin having taken his seat along with bedfellow bishops Religianus and Martinianus, there being present Saturninus, Leporius, Barnabas, Fortunatianus, Rusticus, Lazarus, and Eraclius, -- presbyters, -- while the clergy and a large congregation of laymen stood by, -- Bishop Augustin said: --<br>
<br>
    "The business which I brought before you yesterday, my beloved, as one in connection with which I wished you to attend, as see you have done in greater numbers than usual, must be at once disposed of. For while your minds are anxiously preoccupied with it, you would scarcely listen to me if I were to speak of any other subject. We all are mortal, and the day which shall be the last of life on earth is to every man at all times uncertain; but in infancy there is hope of entering on boyhood, and so our hope goes on, looking forward from boyhood to youth, from youth to manhood, and from manhood to old age: whether these hopes may be realized or not is uncertain, but there is in each case something which may be hoped for. But old age has no other period of this life to look forward to with expectation: how long old age may in any case be prolonged is uncertain, but it is certain that no other age destined to take its place lies beyond. I came to this town -- for such was the will of God -- when I was in the prime of life. I was young then, but now I am old. I know that churches are wont to be disturbed after the decease of their bishops by ambitious or contentious parties, and I feel it to be my duty to take measures to prevent this community from suffering, in connection with my decease, that which I have often observed and lamented elsewhere. You are aware, my beloved, that I recently visited the Church of Milevi; for certain brethren, and especially the servants of God there, requested me to come, because some disturbance was apprehended after the death of my brother and fellow bishop Severus, of blessed memory. I went accordingly, and the Lord was in mercy pleased so to help us that they harmoniously accepted as bishop the person designated by their former bishop his lifetime; for when this designation had become known to them, they willingly acquiesced in the choice which he had made. An omission, however, had occurred by which some were dissatisfied; for brother Severus, believing that it might be sufficient for him to mention to the clergy the name of his successor, did not s. peak of the matter to the people, which gave rise to dissatisfaction in the minds of some. But why should I say more? By the good pleasure of God, the dissatisfaction was removed, joy took its place in the minds of all, and he was ordained as bishop whom Severus had proposed. To obviate all such occasion of complaint in this case, I now intimate to all here my desire, which I believe to be also the will of God: I wish to have for my successor the presbyter Eraclius."<br>
<br>
	 The people shouted, "To God be thanks! To Christ be praise" ( this was repeated twenty-three times). "O Christ, hear us; may Augustin live long!" (repeated sixteen times). "We will have thee as our father, thee as our bishop" (repealed eight times).<br>
<br>
	  2. Silence having been obtained, Bishop Augustin said: --<br>
<br>
"It is unnecessary for me to say anything in praise of Eraclius; I esteem his wisdom and spare his modesty; it is enough that you know him: and I declare that I desire in regard to him what I know you also to desire, and if I had not known it before, I would have had proof of it today. This, therefore, I desire; this I ask from the Lord our God in prayers, the warmth of which is not abated by the chili of age; this I exhort, admonish, and entreat you also to pray for along with me, --that God may confirm that, which He has wrought in us by blending and fusing together the minds of all in the peace of  Christ. May He who has sent him to me preserve him! preserve him safe, preserve him blameless, that as he gives me joy while I live, he may fill my place when I die.<br>
    "The notaries of the church are, as you observe, recording what I say, and recording what you say; both my address and your acclamations are not allowed to fall to the ground. To speak more plainly, we are making up an ecclesiastical record of this day's proceedings; for I wish them to be in this way confirmed so far as pertains to men."<br>
<br>
		The people shouted thirty-six times, "To God be thanks! To Christ be praise!" O Christ, hear us; may Augustin live long!"  was said thirteen times. "Thee, our father! thee, our bishop!" was said eight times. "He is worthy and just," was said twenty times. "Well deserving, well worthy!" was said five times. "He is worthy and just!" was said six times.<br>
<br>
	     3. Silence having been obtained, Bishop Augustin said: --<br>
<br>
    "It is my wish, as I was just now saying, that my desire and your desire be confirmed, so far as pertains to men, by being placed on an ecclesiastical record; but so far as pertains to the will of the Almighty, let us all pray, as I said<br>
<br>
570<br>
<br>
before, that God would confirm that which He has wrought in us."<br>
<br>
		The people shouted, saying sixteen times, "We give thanks for your decision:" then twelve times, "Agreed! Agreed!" and then sixtimes, "Thee,our father! Eraclius, ourbishop!"<br>
<br>
    4. Silence having been obtained, Bishop Augustin said : --<br>
<br>
	   "I approve of that of which you also express your approval;1 but I do not wish that to be done in regard to him which was done in my own case. What was done many of you know; in fact, all of you, excepting only those who at that time were not born, or had not attained to the years of understanding. When my father and bishop, the aged Valerius, of blessed memory, was still living, I was ordained bishop and occupied the episcopal see along with him which I did not know to have been forbidden by the Council of Nice; and he was equally ignorant of the prohibition. I do not wish to have my son here exposed to the same censure as was incurred in my own case."<br>
<br>
  	The people shouted, saying thirteen times, "To Gad be thanks! To Christ be praise!"<br>
<br>
    5. Silence having been obtained, Bishop Augustin said: --<br>
<br>
    "He shall be as he now is, a presbyter, meanwhile; but afterwards, at such time as may please God, your bishop. But now I will assuredly begin to do, as the compassion of Christ may enable me, what I have not hitherto done. You know what for several years I would have done, had you permitted me. It was agreed between you and me that no one should intrude on me for five days of each week, that I might discharge the duty in the study of Scripture which my brethren and fathers the co-bishops were pleased to assign to me in the two councils of Numidia and Carthage. The agreement was duly recorded, you gave your consent, you signified it by acclamations. The record of your consent and of your acclamations, was read aloud to you. For a short time the agreement was observed by you; afterwards, it was violated without consideration, and I am not permitted to have leisure for the work which I wish to do: forenoon and afternoon alike, I am involved in the affairs of other people demanding my attention. I now beseech you, and solemnly engage you, for Christ's sake, to suffer me to devolve the burden of this part of my labours on this young man, I mean on Eraclius, the presbyter, whom today I designate in the name of Christ as my successor in the office of bishop."<br>
<br>
		The people shouted, saying twenty-six times, "We give thanks for your decision."<br>
<br>
    6. Silence having been obtained, Bishop Augustin said: --<br>
<br>
    "I give thanks before the Lord our God for your love and your goodwill; yes, I give thanks to God for these. Wherefore, henceforth, my brethren, let everything which was wont to be brought by you to me be brought to him. In any case in which he may think my advice necessary, I will not refuse it; far be it from me to withdraw this: nevertheless, let everything be brought to him which used to be brought to me. Let Eraclius himself, if in any case, perchance, he be at a loss as to what should be done, either consult me, or claim an assistant in me, whom he has known as a father. By this arrangement you will, on the one hand, suffer no disadvantage, and I will at length, for the brief space during which God may prolong my life, devote the remainder of my days, be they few or many, not to idleness nor to the indulgence of a love of ease, but, so far as Eraclius kindly gives me leave, to the study of the sacred Scriptures: this also will be of service to him, and through him to you likewise. Let no one therefore grudge me this leisure, for I claim it only in order to do important work.<br>
    "I see that I have now transacted with you all the business necessary in the matter for which I called you together. The last thing I have to ask is, that as many of you as are able be pleased to subscribe your names to this record. At this point I require a response from you. Let me have it: show ),our assent by some acclamations."<br>
<br>
	The people shouted, saying twenty-five times, "Agreed! agreed!" then twenty-eight times, "It is worthy, it is just!" then fourteen times, "Agreed! agreed!" then twenty-five times, "He has long been worthy, he has long been deserving!" then thirteen times, "We give thanks for your decision!" then eighteen times, "O Christ, hear us; preserve Eraclius!"<br>
<br>
    7. Silence having been obtained, Bishop Augustin said: --<br>
    "It is well that we are able to transact around His sacrifice those things which belong to God; and in this hour appointed for our supplications, I especially exhort you, beloved, to suspend all your occupations and business, and pour out before the Lord your petitions for this church, and for me, and for the presbyter Eraclius."<br>

<br>
	TO PALATINUS, MY WELL-BELOVED LORD AND SON, MOST TENDERLY LONGED FOR, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    1. Your life of eminent fortitude and fruitfulness towards the Lord our God has brought to us great joy. For "you have made choice of instruction from your youth upwards, that you may still find wisdom even to grey hairs;"1 for "wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age;"2 which may the Lord, who knoweth how to give good gifts unto His children, give to you asking, seeking, knocking.3 Although you have many counsellors and many counsels to direct you in the path which leads to eternal glory, and although, above all, you have the grace of Christ, which has so effectually spoken in saving power in your heart, nevertheless we also, as in duty bound by the love which we owe to you, offer to you, in hereby reciprocating your salutation, some words of counsel, designed not to awaken you as one hindered by sloth or sleep, but to stimulate and quicken you in the race which you are already running.<br>
    2. You require wisdom, my son, for stedfastness in this race, as it was under the influence of wisdom that you entered on it at first. Let this then be "a part of your wisdom, to know whose gift it is." 4 "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass: and He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday."5 "He will make straight thy path, and guide thy steps in peace." 6 As you despised your prospects of greatness in this world, lest you should glory in the abundance of riches which you had begun to covet after the manner of the children of this world, so now, in taking up the yoke of the Lord and His burden, let not your confidence be in your own strength; so shall "His yoke be easy, and His burden light."7 For in the book of Psalms those are alike censured "who trust in their strength," and "who boast themselves in the multitude of their riches." s Therefore, as formerly you did not seek glory in riches, but most wisely despised that which you had begun to desire, so now be on your guard against insidious temptation to trust in your strength; for you are but man, and "cursed is every one that trusteth in man." 9 But by all means trust in God with your whole heart, and He will Himself be your strength, wherein you may trust with piety and thankfulness, and to Him you may say with humility and boldness, "I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; 10 because even the love of God, which, when it is perfect, "casteth out fear,"" is shed abroad in our hearts, not by our strength, that is, by any human power, but, as the apostle says, "by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us."12<br>
    3. "Watch, therefore, and pray that you enter not into temptation."13 Such prayer is indeed in itself an admonition to you that you need the help of the Lord, and that you ought not to rest upon yourself your hope of living well. For now you pray, not that you may obtain the riches and honours of this present world, or any unsubstantial human possession, but that you may not enter into temptation, a thing which would not be asked in prayer if a man could accomplish it for himself by his own will. Wherefore we would not pray that we may not enter into temptation if our own will sufficed for our protection and yet if the will to avoid temptation were wanting to us, we could not so pray. It may, therefore, be present with us to will,14 when we have through his own gift been made wise, but we must pray that we may be able to perform that which we have so willed. In the fact that you have begun to exercise this true wisdom, you have reason to give thanks. "For what have you which you have not received? But if you have received it, beware that you boast not as if you had not received it,"15 that is, as if you could have had it of yourself. Knowing, however, whence you have received it, ask Him by whose gift it was begun to grant that it may be perfected. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of His good pleasure;"16 for "the will is prepared by God,"17 and "the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delighteth in his way."18 Holy meditation on these things will preserve you, so that your wisdom shall be piety, that is, that by God's gift you shall be good, and not ungrateful for the grace of Christ.<br>
    4. Your parents, unfeignedly rejoicing with you in the better hope which in the Lord you have begun to cherish, are longing earnestly for your presence. But whether you be absent from us or present with us in the body, we desire to have you with us in the one Spirit by whom love<br>
<br>
572<br>
<br>
is shed abroad in our hearts, so that, in whatever place our bodies may sojourn, our spirits may be in no degree sundered from each other.<br>
    We have most thankfully received the cloaks of goat's-hair cloth1 which you sent to us, in which gift you have yourself anticipated me in admonition as to the duty of being often engaged in prayer, and of practising humility in our supplications.<br>

<br>
TO PROCULUS AND CYLINUS, BRETHREN MOST BELOVED AND HONOURABLE, AND PARTNERS IN THE SACERDOTAL OFFICE, AUGUSTIN, FLORENTIUS AND SECUNDINUS SEND GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. When our son Leporius, whom for his obstinacy in error you had justly and fitly rebuked, came to us after he had been expelled by you, we received him as one afflicted for his good, whom we should, if possible, deliver from error and restore to spiritual health. For, as you obeyed in regard to him the apostolic precept, "Warn the unruly," so it was our part to obey the precept immediately annexed, "Comfort the feeble-minded, and support the weak." 2 His error was indeed not unimportant, seeing that he neither approved what is right nor perceived what is true in some things relating to the only-begotten Son of God, of whom it is written that, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," but that when the fulness of time had come, "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;"3 for he denied that God became man, regarding it as a doctrine from which it must follow necessarily that the divine substance in which He is equal to the Father suffered some unworthy change or corruption, and not seeing that he was thus introducing into the Trinity a fourth person, which is utterly contrary to the sound doctrine of the Creed and of Catholic truth. Since, however, dearly beloved and honourable brethren, he had as a fallible man" been overtaken" in this error, we did our utmost, the Lord helping us, to instruct him "in the spirit of meekness," especially remembering that when the "chosen vessel "gave this command to which we refer, he added, "Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted," -- test some, perchance, should so rejoice in the measure of spiritual progress as to imagine that they could no longer be tempted like other men, -- and joined with it the salutary and peace-promoting sentence, "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."4<br>
    2. This restoration of Leporius we could perhaps in nowise have accomplished, had you not previously censured and punished those things in him which required correction. So then the same Lord, our Divine Physician, using His own instruments and servants, has by you wounded him when he was proud, and by us healed him when he was penitent, according to his own saying, "I wound, and I heal." s The same Divine Ruler and Overseer of His own house has by you thrown down what was defective in the building, and has by us replaced with a well-ordered structure what he had removed. The same Divine Husbandman has in His careful diligence by you rooted up what was barren and noxious in His field, and by us planted what is useful and fruitful. Let us not, therefore, ascribe glory to ourselves, but to the mercy of Him in whose hand both we and all our words are. And as we humbly praise the work which you have done as His ministers in the case of our son aforesaid, so do you rejoice with holy joy in the work performed by us. Receive, then, with the love of fathers and of brethren, him whom we have with merciful severity corrected. For although one part of the work was done by you and another part by us, both parts, being indispensable to our brother's salvation, were done by the same love. The same God was therefore working in both, for "God is love."6<br>
    3. Wherefore, as he has been welcomed into fellowship by us on the ground of his repentance, let him be welcomed by you on the ground of his letter? to which letter we have thought it right to adhibit our signatures attesting its genuiness. We have not the least doubt that you, in the exercise of Christian love, will not only hear with pleasure of his amendment, but also make it known to those to whom his error was a stumbling-block. For those who came with him to us have also been corrected and restored along with him, as is declared by their signatures, which have been adhibited to the letter in our presence. It remains only that you, being made joyful by the salvation of a brother, condescend to make us joyful in our turn by sending a reply to our communication. Farewell in the Lord, most beloved and honourable brethren; such is our desire on your behalf: remember us.<br>

<br>
                       LETTER CCXX. (A.D. 427.)<br>
<br>
	TO MY LORD BONIFACE,1 MY SON COMMENDED TO THE GUARDIANSHIP AND GUIDANCE OF DIVINE MERCY, FOR PRESENT AND ETERNAL SALVATION AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    1. Never could I have found a more trustworthy man, nor one who could have more ready access to your ear when bearing a letter from me, than this servant and minister of Christ, the deacon Paulus, a man very dear to both of us, whom the Lord has now brought to me in order that I may have the opportunity of addressing you, not in reference to your power and the honour which you hold in this evil world, nor in reference to the preservation of your corruptible and mortal body, -- because this also is destined to pass away, and how soon no one can tell, -- but in reference to that salvation which has been promised to us by Christ, who was here on earth despised and crucified in order that He might teach us rather to despise than to desire the good things of this world, and to set our affections and our hope on that world which He has revealed by His resurrection. For He has risen from the dead, and now "dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over Him."2<br>
    2. I know that you have no lack of friends, who love you so far as life in this world is concerned, and who in regard to it give you counsels, sometimes useful, sometimes the reverse; for they are men, and therefore, though they use their wisdom to the best of their ability in regard to what is present, they know not what may happen on the morrow. But it is not easy for any one to give you counsel in reference to God, to prevent the perdition of your soul, not because you lack friends who would do this, but because it is difficult for them to find an opportunity of speaking with you on these subjects. For I myself have often longed for this, and never found place or time in which I might deal with you as I ought to deal with a man whom I ardently love in Christ. You know besides in what state you found me at Hippo, when you did me the honor to come to visit me, -- how I was scarcely able to speak, being prostrated by bodily weakness. Now, then, my son, hear me when I have this opportunity of addressing you at least by a letter, -- a rare opportunity, for it was not in my power to send such communication to you in the midst of your dangers, both because I apprehended danger to the bearer, and because I was afraid lest my letter should reach persons into whose hands I was unwilling that it should fall. Wherefore I beg you to forgive me if you think that I have been more afraid than I should have been; however this may be, I have stated what I feared.<br>
    3. Hear me, therefore; nay, rather hear the Lord our God snaking by me, His feeble servant. Call to remembrance what manner of man you were while your former wife, of hallowed memory, still lived, and how under the stroke of her death, while that event was yet recent, the vanity of this world made you recoil from it, and how you earnestly desired to enter the service of God. We know and we can testify what you said as to your state of mind and your desires when you conversed with us at Tubunae. My brother Alypius and I were alone with you. [I beseech you, then, to call to remembrance that conversation], for I do not think that the worldly cares with which you are now engrossed can have such power over you as to have effaced this wholly from your memory. You were then desirous to abandon all the public business in which you were engaged, and to withdraw into sacred retirement, and live like the servants of God who have embraced a monastic life. And what was it that prevented you from acting according to these desires? Was it not that you were influenced by considering, on our representation of the matter, how much service the work which then occupied you might render to the churches of Christ if you pursued it with this single aim, that they, protected from all disturbance by barbarian hordes, might live "a quiet and peaceable life," as the apostle says, "in all godliness and honesty;"3 resolving at the same time for your own part to seek no more from this world than would suffice for the support of yourself and those dependent on you, wearing as your girdle the cincture of a perfectly chaste self-restraint, and having underneath the accoutrements of the soldier the surer and stronger defence of spiritual armour.<br>
    4. At the very time when we were full of joy that you had formed this resolution, you embarked on a voyage and you married a second wife. Your embarkation was an act of the obedience due, as the apostle has taught us, to the "higher powers;" 4 but you would not have married again had you not, abandoning the continence to which you had devoted yourself, been overcome by concupiscence. When I learned this, I was, I must confess it, dumb with amazement; but, in my sorrow, I was in some degree comforted by hearing that you refused to marry her unless she became a Catholic before the marriage, and yet the heresy of those who refuse to believe in the true Son of God has so prevailed in your house, that by these heretics your daughter was baptized. Now, if the report be true (would<br>
574<br>
<br>
to God that it were false !) that even some who were dedicated to God as His handmaids have been by these heretics re-baptized, with what floods of tears ought this great calamity to be bewailed by us ! Men are saying, moreover,perhaps it is an unfounded slander, -- that one wife does not satisfy your passions, and that you have been defiled by consorting with some other women as concubines.<br>
    5. What shall I say regarding these evils -- so patent to all, and so great in magnitude as well as number -- of which you have been, directly or indirectly, the cause since the time of your being married ? You are a Christian, you have a conscience, you fear God; consider, then, for yourself some things which I prefer to leave unsaid, and you will find for how great evils you ought to do penance; and I believe that it is to afford you an opportunity of doing this in the way in which it ought to be done, that the Lord is now sparing you and delivering you from all dangers. But if you will listen to the counsel of Scripture, I pray you, "make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day."1 You allege, indeed, that you have good reason for what you have done, and that I cannot be a judge of the sufficiency of that reason, because I cannot hear both sides of the question; 2 but, whatever be your reason, the nature of which it is not necessary at present either to investigate or to discuss, can you, in the presence of God, affirm that you would ever have come into the embarrassments of your present position had you not loved the good things of this world, which, being a servant of God, such as we knew you to be formerly, it was your duty to have utterly despised and esteemed as of no value, -- accepting, indeed, what was offered to you, that you might devote it to pious uses, but not so coveting that which was denied to you, or was entrusted to your care, as to be brought on its account into the difficulties of your present position, in which, while good is loved, evil things are perpetrated, -- few, indeed, by you, but many because of you, and while things are dreaded which, if hurtful, are so only for a short time, things are done which are really hurtful for eternity?<br>
    6. To mention one of these things, -- who can help seeing that many persons follow you for the purpose of defending your power or safety, who, although they may be all faithful to you, and no treachery is to be apprehended from any of them, are desirous of obtaining through you certain advantages which they also covet, not with a godly desire, but from worldly motives? And in this way you, whose duty it is to curb and check your own passions, are forced to satisfy those of others. To accomplish this, many things which are displeasing to God must be done; and yet, after all, these passions are i not thus satisfied, for they are more easily mortified finally in those who love God, than satisfied even for a time in those who love the world. Therefore the Divine Scripture says: "Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever, as God abideth for ever."3 Associated, therefore, as you are with such multitudes of armed men, whose passions must be humoured, and whose cruelty is dreaded, how can the desires of these men who love the world ever be, I do not say satiated, but even partially gratified by you, in your anxiety to prevent still greater widespread evils, unless you do that which God forbids, and in so doing become obnoxious to threatened judgment? So complete has been the havoc wrought in order to indulge their passions, that it would be difficult now to find anything for the plunderer to carry away.<br>
    7. But what shall I say of the devastation of Africa at this hour by hordes of African barbarians, to whom no resistance is offered, while you are engrossed with such embarrassments in your own circumstances, and are taking no measures for averting this calamity? Who would ever have believed, who would have feared, after Boniface had become a Count of the Empire and of Africa, and had been placed in command in Africa with so large an army and so great authority, that the same man who formerly, as Tribune, kept all these barbarous tribes in peace, by storming their strongholds, and menacing them with his small band of brave confederates, should now have suffered the barbarians to be so bold, to encroach so far, to destroy and plunder so much, and to turn into deserts such vast regions once densely peopled? Where were any found that did not predict that, as soon as you obtained the authority of Count, the African hordes would be not only checked, but made tributaries to the Roman Empire? And now, how completely the event has disappointed men's hopes you yourself perceive; in fact, I need say nothing more on this subject, because your own reflection must suggest much more than I can put in words.<br>
    8. Perhaps you defend yourself by replying that the blame here ought rather to rest on persons who have injured you, and, instead of justly<br>
<br>

<br>
requiting the services rendered by you in your office, have returned evil for good. These matters I am not able to examine and judge. I beseech you rather to contemplate and inquire into the matter, in which you know that you have to do not with men at all, but with God; living in Christ as a believer, you are bound to fear lest you offend Him. For my attention is more engaged by higher causes, believing that men ought to ascribe Africa's great calamities to their own sins. Nevertheless, I would not wish you to belong to the number of those wicked and unjust men whom God uses as instruments in inflicting temporal punishments on whom He pleases; for He who justly employs their malice to inflict temporal judgments on others, reserves eternal punishments for the unjust themselves if they be not reformed. Be it yours to fix your thoughts on God, and to look to Christ, who has conferred on you so great blessings and endured for you so great sufferings. Those who desire to belong to His kingdom, and to live for ever happily with! Him and under Him, love even their enemies do good to them that hate them, and pray for those from whom they suffer persecution;1 and if, at any time, in the way of discipline they use irksome severity, yet they never lay aside the sincerest love. If these benefits, though earthly and transitory, are conferred on you by the Roman Empire, -- for that empire itself is earthly, not heavenly, and cannot bestow what it has not in its power, -- if, I say, benefits are conferred on you, return not evil for good; and if evil be inflicted on you, return not evil for evil. Which of these two has happened in your case I am unwilling to discuss, I am unable to judge. I speak to a Christian return not either evil for good, nor evil for evil.<br>
    9. You say to me, perhaps: In circumstances so difficult, what do you wish me to do ? If you ask counsel of me in a worldly point of view how your safety in this transitory life may be secured, and the power and wealth belonging to you at present may be preserved or even increased, I know not what to answer you, for any counsel regarding things so uncertain as these must partake of the uncertainty inherent in them. But i if you consult me regarding your relation to God and the salvation of your soul, and if you fear the word of truth which says: "What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"2 I have a plain answer to give. I am prepared with advice to which you may well give heed. But what need is there for my saying anything else than what I have already  said. "Love not the world, neither the things, that are in the world. If any man love the world, he love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever." 3 Here is counsel ! Seize it and act on it. Show that you are a brave man. Vanquish the desires with which the world is loved. Do penance for the evils of your past life, when, vanquished by your passions, you were drawn away by sinful desires. If you receive this counsel, and hold it fast, and act on it, you will both attain to those blessings which are certain, and occupy yourself in the midst of these uncertain things without forfeiting the salvation of your soul.<br>
    10. But perhaps you again ask of me how you can do these things, entangled as you are with so great worldly difficulties. Pray earnestly, and say to God, in the words of the Psalm: "Bring Thou me out of my distresses," 4 for these distresses terminate when the passions in which they originate are vanquished. He who has heard your prayer and ours on your behalf, that you might be delivered from the numerous and great dangers of visible wars in which the body is exposed to the danger of losing the life which sooner or later must end, but in which the soul perishes not unless it be held captive by evil passions, -- He, I say, will hear your prayer that you may, in an invisible and spiritual conflict, overcome your inward and invisible enemies, that is to say, your passions themselves, and may so use the world, as not abusing it, so that with its good things you may do good, not become bad through possessing them. Because these things are in themselves good, and are not given to men except by Him who has power over all things in heaven and earth. Lest these gifts of His should be reckoned bad, they are given also to the good; at the same time, lest they should be reckoned great, or the supreme good, they are given also to the bad. Further, these things are taken away from the good for their trial, and from the bad for their punishment.<br>
    11. For who is so ignorant, who so foolish, as not to see that the health of this mortal body, and the strength of its corruptible members, and victory over men who are our enemies, and temporal honours and power, and all other mere earthly advantages are given both to the good and to the bad, and are taken away both from the good and from the bad alike ? But the salvation of the soul, along with immortality of the body, and the power of righteousness, and victory over hostile passions, and glory, and honour, and everlasting peace, are not given except to the good. Therefore love these things, covet<br>
<br>
576<br>
<br>
these things, and seek them by every means in your power. With a view to acquire and retain these things, give alms, pour forth prayers, practise fasting as far as you can without injury to your body. But do not love these earthly goods, how much soever they may abound to you. So use them as to do many good things by them, but not one evil thing for their sake. For all such things will perish; but good works, yea, even those good works which are performed by means of the perishable good things of this world, shall never perish.<br>
    12. If you had not now a wife, I would say to you what we said at Tubunae, that you should live in the holy state of continence, and would add that you should now do what we prevented you from doing at that time, namely, withdraw yourself so far as might be possible without: prejudice to the public welfare from the labours of military service, and take to yourself the leisure which you then desired for that life in the society of the saints in which the soldiers of Christ fight in silence, not to kill men, but to "wrestle against principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness,"1 that is, the devil and his angels. For the saints gain their victories over enemies whom they cannot see, and yet they gain the victory over these unseen enemies by gaining the victory over things which are the objects of sense. I am, however, prevented from exhorting you to that mode of life by your having a wife, since without her consent it is not lawful for you to live under a vow of continence; because, although you did wrong in marrying again after the declaration which you made at Tubunae, she, being not aware of this became your wife innocently and without restrictions. Would that you could persuade her to agree to a vow of continence, that you might without hindrance render to God what you know to be due to Him! If, however, you cannot make this agreement with her, guard carefully by all means conjugal chastity, and pray to God, who will deliver you out of difficulties, that you may at some future time be able to do what is meanwhile impossible. This, however, does not affect your obligation to love God and not to love the world, to hold the faith stedfastly even in the cares of war, if you must still be engaged in them, and to seek peace; to make the good things of this world serviceable in good works, and not to do what is evil in labouring to obtain these earthly good things, -- in all these duties your wife is not, or, if she is, ought not to be, a hindrance to you.<br>
    These things I have written, my dearly beloved son, at the bidding of the love with which I love you with regard not to this world, but to God; and because, mindful of the words of Scripture, "Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee; reprove a fool, and he will hate thee more,"2 I was bound to think of you as certainly not a fool but a wise man.<br>

                  LETTER CCXXVII. (A.D. 428 or 429.)<br>
TO THE AGED ALYPIUS, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    Brother Paulus has arrived here safely: he reports that the pains devoted to the business which engaged him have been rewarded with success .; the Lord will grant that with these his trouble in that matter may terminate. He salutes you warmly, and tells us tidings concerning Gabinianus which give us joy, namely, that having by God's mercy obtained a prosperous issue in his case, he is now not only in name a Christian, but in sincerity a very excellent convert to the faith, and was baptized recently at Easter, having both in his heart and on his lips the grace which he received. How much I long for him I can never express; but you know that I love him.<br>
    The president of the medical faculty? Dioscorus, has also professed the Christian faith, having obtained grace at the same time. Hear the manner of his conversion, for his stubborn neck and his bold tongue could not be subdued without some miracle. His daughter, the only comfort of his life, was sick, and her sickness became so serious that her life was, according even to her father's own admission, despaired of. It is reported, and the truth of the report is beyond question, for even before brother Paul's return the fact was mentioned to me by Count Peregrinus, a most respectable and truly Christian man, who was baptized at the same time with Dioscorus and Gabinianus, -- it is reported, I say, that the old man, feeling himself at last constrained to implore the compassion of Christ, bound himself by a vow that he would become a Christian if he saw her restored to health. She recovered, but he perfidiously drew back from fulfilling his vow. Nevertheless the hand of the Lord was still stretched forth, for suddenly he is smitten with blindness, and immediately the cause of this calamity was impressed upon his mind. He confessed his fault aloud, and vowed again that if his sight were given back he would perform i what he had vowed. He recovered his sight, fulfilled his vow, and still the hand of God was stretched forth. He had not committed the Creed to memory, or perhaps had refused to commit it, and had excused himself on the plea of inability. God had seen this. Immediately<br>
<br>
577<br>
<br>
after all the ceremonies of his reception he is seized with paralysis, affecting many, indeed almost all his members, and even his tongue. Then, being warned by a dream, he confesses in writing that it had been told to him that this had happened because be had not repeated the Creed. After that confession the use of all his members was restored to him, except the tongue alone; nevertheless he, being still under this affliction, made manifest by writing that he had, notwithstanding, learned the Creed, and still retained it in his memory; and so that frivolous loquacity which, as you know, blemished his natural kindliness, and made him, when he mocked Christians, exceedingly profane, was altogether destroyed in him, What shall I say, but, "Let us sing a hymn to the Lord, and highly exalt Him for ever ! Amen."<br>
<br>
                  LETTER CCXXVIII. (A.D. 428 or 429.)<br>
<br>
	TO HIS HOLY BROTHER AND CO-BISHOP HONORATUS,1 AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. I thought that by sending to your Grace a copy of the letter which I wrote to our brother and co-bishop Quodvultdeus,2 I had earned exemption from the burden which you have imposed upon me, by asking my advice as to what you ought to do in the midst of the dangers which have befallen us in these times. For although I wrote briefly, I think that I did not pass over anything that was necessary either to be said by me or heard by my questioner in correspondence on the subject: for I said that, on the one hand, those who desire to remove, if they can, to fortified places are not to be forbidden to do so; and, on the other hand, we ought not to break the ties by which the love of Christ has bound us as ministers not to forsake the churches which it is our duty to serve. The words which I used in the letter referred to were: "Therefore, however small may be the congregation of God's people among whom we are, if our ministry is so necessary to them that it is a clear duty not to withdraw it from them, it remains for us to say to the Lord, 'Be Thou to us a God of defence, and a strong fortress.'"3<br>
    2. But this counsel does not commend itself to you, because, as you say in your letter, it does not become us to endeavour to act in opposition to the preceptor example of the Lord, admonishing us that we should flee from one city to another. We remember, indeed, the words of the Lord, "When they persecute you in one city, flee to another;"4 but who can believe that the Lrod wished this to be done in cases in which the flocks which He purchased with His own blood are by the desertion of their pastors left without that necessary ministry which is indispensable to their life? Did Christ do this Himself, when, carried by His parents, He fled into Egypt in His infancy? No; for He had not then gathered churches which we could affirm to have been deserted by Him. Or, when the Apostle Paul was "let down in a basket through a window," to prevent his enemies from seizing him, and so escaped their hands, s was the church in Damascus deprived of the necessary labours of Christ's servants? Was not all the service that was requisite supplied after his departure by other brethren settled in that city? For the apostle had done this at their request, in order that he might preserve for the Church's good his life, which the persecutor on that occasion specially sought to destroy. Let those, therefore, who are servants of Christ, His ministers in word and sacrament, do what he has commanded or permitted. When any of them is specially sought for by persecutors, let him by all means flee from one city to another, provided that the Church is not hereby deserted, but that others who are not specially sought after remain to supply spiritual food to their fellow-servants, whom they know to be unable otherwise to maintain spiritual life. When, however, the danger of all, bishops, clergy, and laity, is alike, let not those who depend upon the aid of others be deserted by those on whom they depend. In that case, either let all remove together to fortified places, or let those who must remain be not deserted by those through whom in things pertaining to the Church their necessities must be provided for; and so let them share life in common, or share in common that which the Father of their family appoints them to suffer.<br>
    3. But if it shall happen that all suffer, whether some suffer less, and others more, or all suffer equally, it is easy to see who among them are suffering for the sake of others: they are obviously those who, although they might have freed themselves from such evils by flight, have chosen to remain rather than abandon others to whom they are necessary. By such conduct especially is proved the love commended by the Apostle John in the words: "Christ laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren." 6 For those who betake themselves to flight, or are prevented from doing so only by circumstances thwarting their design, if they be seized and made to suffer, endure this suffering only for themselves;not for their broth-<br>
578<br>
<br>
ren; but those who are involved in suffering because of their resolving not to abandon others, whose Christian welfare depended on them, are unquestionably "laying down their lives for the! brethren."<br>
    4. For this reason, the saying which we have heard attributed to a certain bishop, namely: "If the Lord has commanded us to flee, in those persecutions in which we may reap the fruit of martyrdom, how much more ought we to escape by flight, if we can, from barren sufferings inflicted by the hostile incursions of barbarians !" is a saying true and worthy of acceptation, but applicable only to those who are not confined by the obligations of ecclesiastical office. For the man who, having it in his power to escape from the violence of the enemy, chooses not to flee from it, lest in so doing he should abandon the ministry of Christ, without which men can neither become Christians nor live as such, assuredly finds a greater reward of his love, than the man who, fleeing not for his brethren's sake but for his own, is seized by persecutors, and, refusing to deny Christ, suffers martyrdom.<br>
    5. What, then, shall we say to the position which you thus state in your former epistle: -- "I do not see what good we can do to ourselves or to the people by continuing to remain in the churches, except to see before our eyes men slain, women outraged, churches burned, ourselves expiring amid torments applied in order to extort from us what we do not possess"? God is powerful to hear the prayers of His children and to avert those things which they fear; and we ought not, on account of evils that are uncertain, to make up our minds absolutely to the desertion of that ministry, without which the people must certainly suffer ruin, not in the affairs of this life, but of that other life which ought to be cared for with incomparably greater diligence and solicitude. For if those evils which are apprehended, as possibly visiting the places in which we are, were certain, all those for whose sake it was our duty to remain would take flight before us, and would thus exempt us from the neccessity of remaining; for no one says that ministers are under obligation to remain in any place where none remain to whom their ministry is necessary. In this way some holy bishops fled from Spain when their congregations had, before their flight, been annihilated, the members having either fled, or died by the sword, or perished in the siege of their towns, or gone into captivity: but many more of the bishops of that country remained in the midst of these abounding dangers, because those for whose sakes they remained were still remaining there. And if some have abandoned their flocks, this is what we say ought not to be done, for they were not taught to do so by divine authority, but were, through human infirmity, either deceived by an error or overcome by fear.<br>
    6. [We maintain, as one alternative, that they were deceived by an error,] for why do they think that indiscriminate compliance must be given to the precept in which they read of fleeing from one city to another, and not shrink with abhorrence from the character of the "hireling," who "seeth the wolf coming, and fleeth, because he careth not for the sheep"?1 Why do they not honour equally both of these true sayings of the Lord, the one in which flight is permitted or enjoined, the other in which it is rebuked and censured, by taking pains so to understand them as to find that they are, as is indeed the case, not opposed to each other? And how is their reconciliation to be found, unless that which I have above proved be borne in mind, that under pressure of persecution we who are ministers of Christ ought to flee from the places in which we are only in one or other of two cases, namely, either that there is no congregation to which we may minister, or that there is a congregation, but that the ministry necessary for it can be supplied by others who have not the same reason for flight as makes it imperative on us ? Of which we have one example, as already mentioned, in the Apostle Paul escaping by being let down from the wall in a basket, when he was personally sought by the persecutor, there being others on the spot who had not the same necessity for flight, whose remaining would prevent the Church from being destitute of the service of ministers. Another example we have in the holy Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, who fled when the Emperor Constantius wished to seize him specially, the Catholic people who remained in Alexandria not being abandoned by the other servants of God. But when the people remain and the servants of God flee, and their service is withdrawn, what is this but the guilty flight of the "hireling" who careth not for the sheep ? For the wolf will come, -- not man, but the devil, who has very often perverted to apostasy believers to whom the daily ministry of the Lord's body was wanting; and so, not "through thy knowledge," but through thine ignorance, "shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died."2<br>
    7. As for those, however, who flee not because they are deceived by an error, but,because they have been overcome by fear, why do they not rather, by the compassion and help of the Lord bestowed on them, bravely fight against their fear, lest evils incomparably heavier and much more to be dreaded befall them? This victory over fear is won wherever the flame of the love of God, without the smoke of worldliness, burns<br>
579<br>
<br>
in the heart. For love says, "Who is weak, and I am not weak ? who is offended, and I burn not ?"1 But love is from God. Let us, therefore, beseech Him who requires it of us to bestow it on us, and under its influence let us fear more lest the sheep of Christ should be slaughtered by the sword of spiritual wickedness reaching the heart, than lest they should fall under the sword that can only harm that body in which men are destined at any rate, at some time, and in some way or other, to die. Let us fear more lest the purity of faith should perish through the taint of corruption in the inner man, than lest our women should be subjected by violence to outrage; for if chastity is preserved in the spirit, it is not destroyed by such violence, since it is not destroyed even in the body when there is no base consent of the sufferer to the sin, but only a submission without the consent of the will to that which another does. Let us fear more lest the spark of life in "living stones" be quenched through our absence, than lest the stones and timbers of our earthly buildings be burned in our presence. Let us fear more lest the members of Christ's body should die for want of spiritual food, than lest the members of our own bodies, being overpowered by the violence of enemies, should be racked with torture. Not because these are things which we ought not to avoid when this is in our power, but because we ought to prefer to suffer them when they cannot be avoided without impiety, unless, perchance, any one be found to maintain that that servant is not guilty of impiety who withdraws the service necessary to piety at the very time when it is peculiarly necessary.<br>
    8. Do we forget how, when these dangers have reached their extremity, and there is no possibility of escaping from them by flight, an extraordinary crowd of persons, of both sexes and of all ages, is wont to assemble in the church, -- some urgently asking baptism, others reconciliation, others even the doing of penance, and all calling for consolation and strengthening through the administration of sacraments? If the ministers of God be not at their posts at such a time, how great perdition overtakes those who depart from this life either not regenerated or not loosed from their sins !2 How deep also is the sorrow of their believing kindred, who shall not have these lost ones with them in the blissful rest of eternal life ! In fine, how loud are the cries of all, and the indignant imprecations of not a few, because of the want of ordinances and the absence of those who should have dispensed them! See what the fear of temporal calamities may effect, and of how great a multitude of eternal calamities it may be the procuring cause. But if the ministers be at their posts, through the strength which God bestows upon them, all are aided,-- some are baptized, others reconciled to the Church. None are defrauded of the communion of the Lord's body; all are consoled, edified, and exhorted to ask of God, who is able to do so, to avert all things which are feared, -- prepared for both alternatives, so that "if the cup may not pass" from them, His will may be done who cannot will anything that is evil.<br>
    9. Assuredly you now see (what, according to your letter, you did not see before) how great advantage the Christian people may obtain if, in the presence of calamity, the presence of the servants of Christ be not withdrawn from them. You see, also, how much harm is done by their absence, when "they seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's,"4 and are destitute of that charity of which it is said, "it seeketh not her own,"5 and fail to imitate him who said, "I seek not mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved,"6 and who, moreover, would not have fled from the insidious attacks of the imperial persecutor, had he not wished to save himself for the sake of others to whom he was necessary; on which account he says, "I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you."7<br>
     10. Here, perhaps, some one may say that the servants of God ought to save their lives by flight when such evils are impending, in order that they may reserve themselves for the benefit of the Church in more peaceful times. This is rightly done by some, when others are not wanting by whom the service of the Church may be supplied, and the work is not deserted by all, as we have stated above that Athanasius did; for the whole Catholic world knows how necessary it was to the Church that he should do so, and how useful was the prolonged life of the man who by his word and loving service defended her against the Arian heretics. But this ought by no means to be done when the danger is common to all; and the thing to be dreaded above all is, lest any one should be supposed to do this not from a desire to secure the welfare of others, but from fear of losing his own life, and should therefore do more harm by the example of deserting the post of duty than all the good that he could do by the preservation of his life for future service. Finally, observe how the holy David acquiesced in the urgent petition of his people, that he should<br>
<br>
580<br>
<br>
not expose himself to the dangers of battle, and, as it is said in the narrative, "quench the light of Israel,"1 but was not himself the first to propose it; for had he been so, he would have made many imitate the cowardice which they might have attributed to him, supposing that he had been prompted to this not through regard to the advantage of others, but under the agitation of fear as to his own life.<br>
    11. Another question which we must not regard as unworthy of notice is suggested here. For if the interests of the Church are not to be lost sight of, and if these make it necessary that when any great calamity is impending some ministers should flee, in order that they may survive to minister to those whom they may find remaining after the calamity is passed, -- the question arises, what is to be done when it appears that, unless some flee, all must perish together? what if the fury of the destroyer were so restricted as to attack none but the ministers of the Church ? What shall we reply ? Is the Church to be deprived of the service of her ministers because of fleeing from their work through fear lest she should be more unhappily deprived of their service because of their dying in the midst of their work ? Of course, if the laity are exempted from the persecution, it is in their power to shelter and conceal their bishops and clergy in some way, as He shall help them under whose dominion all things are, and who, by His wondrous power, can preserve even one who does not flee from danger. But the reason for our inquiring what is the path of our duty in such circumstances is, that we may not be chargeable with tempting the Lord by expecting divine miraculous interposition on every occasion.<br>
    There is, indeed, a difference in the severity of the tempest of calamity when the danger is common to both laity and clergy, as the perils of stormy weather are common to both merchants and sailors on board of the same ship. But far be it from us to esteem this ship of ours so lightly as to admit that it would be right for the crew, and especially for the pilot, to abandon her in the hour of peril, although they might have it in their power to escape by leaping into a small boat, or even swimming ashore. For in the case of those in regard to whom we fear lest through our deserting our work they should perish, the evil which we fear is not temporal death, which is sure to come at one time or other, but eternal death, which may come or may not come, according as we neglect or adopt measures whereby it may be averted. Moreover, when the lives of both laity and clergy are exposed to common danger, what reason have we for thinking that in every place which the enemy may invade all the clergy are likely to be put to death, and not that all the laity shall also die, in which event the clergy, and those to whom they are necessary, would pass from this life at the same time ? Or why may we not hope that, as some of the laity are likely to survive, some of the clergy may also be spared, by whom the necessary ordinances may be dispensed to them ?<br>
    12. Oh that in such circumstances the question debated among the servants of God were which of their number should remain, that the Church might not be left destitute by all fleeing from danger, and which of their number should flee, that the Church might not left destitute by all perishing in the danger. Such a contest will arise among the brethren who are all alike glowing with love and satisfying the claims of love. And if it were in any case impossible otherwise to terminate the debate, it appears to me that the persons who are to remain and who are to flee should be chosen by lot. For those who say that they, in preference to others, ought to flee, will appear to be chargeable either with cowardice, as persons unwilling to face impending danger, or with arrogance, as esteeming their own lives more necessary to be preserved for the good of the Church than those of other men. Again, perhaps, those who are better will be the first to choose to lay down their lives for the brethren; and so preservation by flight will be given to men whose life is less valuable because their skill in counselling and ruling the Church is less; yet these, if they be pious and wise, will resist the desires of men in regard to whom they see, on the one hand, that it is more important for the Church that they should live, and on the other hand, that they would rather lose their lives than flee from danger. In this case, as it is written, "the lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty;" for, in difficulties of this kind, God judges better than men, whether it please Him to call the better among His servants to the reward of suffering, and to spare the weak, or to make the weak stronger to endure trials, and then to withdraw them from this life, as persons whose lives could not be so serviceable to the Church as the lives of the others who are stronger than they. If such an appeal to the lot be made, it will be, I admit, an unusual proceeding, but if it is done in any case, who will dare to find fault with it? Who but the ignorant or the prejudiced will hesitate to praise with the approbation which it deserves? If, however, the use of the lot is not adopted because there is no precedent for such an appeal, let it by all means be secured that the Church<br>
<br>
581<br>
<br>
be not, through the flight of any one, left destitute of that ministry which is more especially necessary and due to her in the midst of such great dangers. Let no one hold himself in such esteem because of apparent superiority in any grace as to say that he is more worthy of life than others, and therefore more entitled to seek safety in flight. For whoever thinks this is too self-satisfied, and whoever utters this must make all dissatisfied with him.<br>
    13. There are some who think that bishops and clergy may, by not fleeing but remaining in such dangers, cause the people to be misled, because, when they see those who are set over them remaining, this makes them not flee from danger. It is easy for them, however, to obviate this objection, and the reproach of misleading others, by addressing their congregations, and saying: "Let not the fact that we are not fleeing from this place be the occasion of misleading you, for we remain here not for our own sakes but for yours, that we may continue to minister to you whatever we know to be necessary to your salvation, which is in Christ; therefore, if you choose to flee, you thereby set us also at liberty from the obligations by which we are bound to remain." This, I think, ought to be said, when it seems to be truly advantageous to remove to places of greater security. If, after such words have been spoken in their hearing, either all or some shall say: "We are at His disposal from whose anger none can escape whithersoever they may go, and whose mercy may be found wherever their lot is cast by those who, whether hindered by known insuperable difficulties, or unwilling to toil after unknown refuges, in which perils may be only changed not finished, prefer not to go away elsewhere," -- most assuredly those who thus resolve to remain ought not to be left destitute of the service of Christian ministers. If, on the other hand after hearing their bishops and clergy speak as above, the people prefer to leave the place, to remain behind them is not now the duty of those who were only remaining for their sakes, because none are left there on whose account it would still be their duty to remain.<br>
    14. Whoever, therefore, flees from danger in circumstances in which the Church is not deprived, through his flight, of necessary service, is doing that which the Lord has commanded or permitted. But the minister who flees when the consequence of his flight is the withdrawal from Christ's flock of that nourishment by which its spiritual life is sustained, is an "hireling who seeth the wolf coming, and fleeth because he careth not for the sheep."<br>
    With love, which I know to be sincere, I have now written what I believe to be true on this question, because you asked my opinion, my dearly beloved brother; but I have not enjoined you to follow my advice, if you can find any better than mine. Be that as it may, we cannot find anything better for us to do in these dangers than continually beseech the Lord our God to have compassion on us. And as to the matter about which I have written, namely, that ministers should not desert the churches of God, some wise and holy men have by the gift of God been enabled both to will and to do this thing, and have not in the least degree faltered in the determined prosecution of their purpose, even though exposed to the attacks of slanderers.<br>

                      LETTER CCXXIX. (A.D. 429.)<br>
<br>
TO DARIUS,1 HIS DESERVEDLY ILLUSTRIOUS AND VERY POWERFUL LORD AND DEAR SON CHRIST, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. Your character and rank I have learned from my holy brothers and co-bishops, Urbanus and Novatus. The former of these became acquainted with you near Carthage, in the town of Hilari, and more recently in the town of Sicca; the latter at Sitifis. Through them it has come to pass that I cannot regard you as unknown to me. For though my bodily weakness and the chill of age do not permit me to converse with you personally, it cannot on this account be said that I have not seen you; for the conversation of Urbanus, when he kindly visited me, and the letters of Novatus, so described to me the features, not of your face but of your mind, that I have seen you, and have seen you with all the more pleasure, because l have seen not the outward appearance but the inner man. These features of your character are joyfully seen both by us, and through the mercy of God by yourself also, as in a mirror in the holy Gospel, in which it is written in words uttered by Him who is truth: "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God."2<br>
    2. Those warriors are indeed great and worthy of singular honour, not only for their consummate bravery, but also (which is a higher praise) for their eminent fidelity, by whose labours and dangers, along with the blessing of divine protection and aid, enemies previously unsubdued are conquered, and peace obtained for the State, and the provinces reduced to subjection. But it is a higher glory still to stay war itself with a word, than to slay men with the sword, and to<br>
<br>
582<br>
<br>
procure or maintain peace by peace, not by war. For those who fight, if they are good men, doubtless seek for peace; nevertheless it is through blood. Your mission, however, is to prevent the shedding of blood. Yours, therefore, is the privilege of averting that calamity which others are under the necessity of producing. Therefore, my deservedly illustrious and very powerful lord and very dear son in Christ, rejoice in this singularly great and real blessing vouchsafed to you, and enjoy it in God, to whom you owe that you are what you are, and that you undertook the accomplishment of such a work. May God "strengthen that which He hath wrought for us through you."1 Accept this our salutation, and deign to reply. From the letter of my brother Novatus, I see that he has taken pains that your learned Excellency should become acquainted with me also through my works. If, then, you have read what he has given you, I also shall have become known to your inward perception. As far as I can judge, they will not greatly displease you if you have read them in a loving rather than a critical spirit. It is not much to ask, but it will be a great favour, if for this letter and my works you send us one letter in reply. I salute with due affection the pledge of peace,2 which through the favour of our Lord and God you have happily received.<br>
<br>
                      LETTER CCXXXI. (A.D. 429.)<br>
	TO DARIUS, HIS SON, AND A MEMBER OF CHRIST, AUGUSTIN, A SERVANT OF CHRIST AND OF THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST, SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. You requested an answer from me as a proof that I had gladly received your letter. Behold, then, I write again; and yet I cannot express the pleasure I felt, either by this answer or by any other, whether I write briefly or at the utmost length, for neither by few words nor by many is it possible for me to express to you what words can never express. I, indeed, am not eloquent, though ready in speech; but I could by no means allow any man, however eloquent, even though he could see as well into my mind as I do myself, to do that which is beyond my own power, viz. to describe in a letter, however able and however long, the effect which your epistle had on my mind. It remains, then, for me so to express to you what you wished to know, that you may understand as being in my words that which they do not express. What, then, shall I say? That I was delighted with your letter, exceedingly delighted ; -- the repetition of this word is not a mere repetition, but, as it were, a perpetual affirmation; because it was impossible to be always saying it, therefore it has been at least once repeated, for in this way perhaps my feelings may be expressed.<br>
  2. If some one inquire here what after all delighted me so exceedingly in your letter, -- "Was it its eloquence?" I will answer, No; and he, perhaps, will reply, "Was it, then, the praises bestowed on yourself?" but again I will reply, No; and I shall reply thus not because these things are not in that letter, for the eloquence in it is so great that it is very clearly evident that you are naturally endowed with the highest talents, and that you have been most carefully educated; and your letter is undeniably full of my praises. Some one then may say, "Do not these things delight you?" Yes, truly, for "my heart is not," as the poet says, "of horn,"4 so that I should either not observe these things or observe them without delight. These things do delight; but what have these things to do with that with which I said I was highly delighted? Your eloquence delights me since it is at once genial in sentiment and dignified in expression; and though assuredly I am not delighted with all sorts of praise from all sorts of persons, but only with such praises as you have thought me worthy of, and only coming from those who are such as you are -- that is, from persons who, for Christ's sake, love His servants, I cannot deny that I am delighted with the praises bestowed upon me in your letter.<br>
    3. Thoughtful and experienced men will be at no loss as to the opinion which they should form of Themistocles (if I remember the name rightly), who, having refused at a banquet to play on the lyre, a thing which the distinguished and learned men of Greece were accustomed to do, and having been on that account regarded as uneducated, was asked, when he expressed his contempt for that sort of amusement, "What, then, does it delight you to hear?" and is reported to have answered: "My own praises." Thoughtful and experienced men will readily see with what design and in what sense these words must have been used by him, or must be understood by them, if they are to believe that he uttered them; for he was in the affairs of this world a most remarkable man, as may be illustrated by the answer which he gave when he was further pressed with the question: "What, then, do you know? "I know," he replied,<br>
<br>
583<br>
<br>
"how to make a small republic great." As to the thirst for praise spoken of by Ennius in the words: "All men greatly desire to be praised," I am of opinion that it is partly to be approved of, partly guarded against. For as, on the one hand, we should vehemently desire the truth, which is undoubtedly to be eagerly sought after as alone worthy of praise, even though it be not praised: so, on the other hand, we must carefully shun the vanity which readily insinuates itself along with praise from men: and this vanity is present in the mind when either the things which are worthy of praise are not reckoned worth having unless the man be praised for them by his fellow-men, or things on account of possessing which any man wishes to be much praised are deserving either of small praise, or it may be of severe censure. Hence Horace, a more careful observer than Ennius, says: "Is fame your passion? Wisdom's powerful charm if thrice read over shall its power disarm."1<br>
    4. Thus the poet thought that the malady arising from the love of human praise, which was thoroughly attacked with his satire, was to he charmed away by words of healing power. The great Teacher has accordingly taught us by His apostle, that we ought not to do good with a view to be praised by men, that is, we ought not to make the praises of men the motive for our well-doing; and yet, for the sake of men themselves, He teaches us to seek their approbation. For when good men are praised, the praise does not benefit those on whom it is bestowed, but those who bestowed it. For to the good, so far as they are themselves concerned, it is enough that they are good; but those are to be congratulated whose interest it is to imitate the good when the good are praised by them, since they thus show that the persons whom they sincerely praise are persons whose conduct they appreciate. The apostle says in a certain place, "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ;"2 and the same apostle says in another place, "I please all men in all things," and adds the reason, "Not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."3 Behold what he sought in the praise of men, as it is declared in these words: "Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you."4 All the other things which I have named above, he summed up under the name of Virtue, saying, "If there be any virtue;" but the definition which he subjoined, "Whatsoever things are of good report," he followed up by another suitable word, "If there be any praise." What the apostle says, then, in the first of these passages, "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ," is to be understood as if he said, If the good things which I do were done by me with human praise as my motive, if I were puffed up with the love of praise, I should not be the servant of Christ. The apostle, then, wished to please all men, and rejoiced in pleasing them, not that he might himself be inflated with their praises, but that he being praised might build them up in Christ. Why, then, should it not delight me to be praised by you, since you are too good a man to speak insincerely, and you bestow your praise on things which you love, and which it is profitable and wholesome to love, even though they be not in me ? This, moreover, does not benefit you alone, but also me. For if they are not in me, it is good for me that I am put to the blush, and am made to burn with desire to possess them. And in regard to anything in your praise which I recognise as in my possession, I rejoice that I possess it, and that such things are loved by you, and that I am loved for their sake. And in regard to those things which I do not recognise as belonging to me, I not only desire to obtain them, that I may possess them for myself, but also that those who love me sincerely may not always be mistaken in praising me for them.<br>
    5. Behold how many things I have said, and still I have not yet spoken of that in your letter which delighted me more than your eloquence, and far more than the praises you bestowed on me. What do you think, O excellent man, that this can be ? It is that I have acquired the friendship of so distinguished a man as you are, and that without having even seen you; if, indeed, I ought to speak of one as unseen whose soul I have seen in his own letters, though I have not seen his body. In which letters I rest my opinion concerning you on my own knowledge, and not, as formerly, on the testimony of my brethren. For what your character was I had already heard, but how you stood affected to me I knew not until now. From this, your friendship to me, I doubt not that even the praises bestowed on me, which give me pleasure for a reason about which I have already said enough, will much more abundantly benefit the Church of Christ, since the fact that you possess, and study, and love, and commend my labours in defence of the gospel against the remnant of impious idolaters, secures for me a wider influence in these writings in proportion to the high position which you occupy; for, illustrious your-<br>
<br>
584<br>
<br>
self, you insensibly shed a lustre upon them. You, being celebrated, give celebrity to them, and wherever you shall see that the circulation of them might do good, you will not suffer them to remain altogether unknown. If you ask me how I know this, my reply is, that such is the impression concerning you produced on me by reading your letters. Herein you will now see how great delight your letter could impart to me, for if your opinion of me be favourable, you are aware how great delight is given to me by gain to the cause of Christ. Moreover, when you tell me concerning yourself that, although, as you say, you belong to a family which not for one or two generations, but even to remote ancestors, has been known as able to accept the doctrine of Christ, you have nevertheless been aided by my writings against the Gentile rites so to understand these as you never had done before, can I esteem it a small matter how great benefit our writings, commended and circulated by you, may confer upon others, and to how many and how illustrious persons your testimony may bring them, and how easily and profitably through these persons they may reach others? Or, reflecting on this, can the joy diffused in my heart be small or moderate in degree ?<br>
    6. Since, then, I cannot in words express how great delight I have received from your letter, I have spoken of the reason why it delight me, and may that which I am unable adequately to utter on this subject I leave to you to conjecture. Accept, then, my son -- accept, O excellent man, Christian not by outward profession merely, but by Christian love -- accept, I say, the books containing my "Confessions," which you desired to have. In these behold me, that you may not praise me beyond what I am; in these believe what is said of me, not by others, but by myself; in these contemplate me, and see what I have been in myself, by myself; and if anything in me please you, join me, because of it, in praising Him to whom, and not to myself, I desire praise to be given. For "He hath made us, and not we ourselves;"1 indeed, we had destroyed ourselves, but He who made us has made us anew. When, however, you find me in these books, pray for me that I may not fail, but be perfected. Pray, my son; pray. I feel what I say; I know what I ask. Let it not seem to you a thing unbecoming, and, as it were, beyond your merits. You will defraud me of a great help if you do not do so. Let not only you yourself, but all also who by your testimony shall come to love me, pray for me. Tell them that I have entreated this, and if you think highly of us, consider that we command what we have asked; in any case, whether as granting a request or obeying a command, pray for us. Read the Divine Scriptures, and you will find that the apostles themselves, the leaden of Christ,s flock, requested this from their sons, or enjoined it on their hearers. I certainly, since you ask it of me, will do this for you as far as I can. He sees this who is the Hearer of prayer, and who saw that I prayed for you before you asked me; but let this proof of love be reciprocated by you. We are placed over you; you are the flock of God. Consider and see that our dangers are greater than yours, and pray for us, for this becomes both us and you, that we may give a good account of you to the Chief Shepherd and Head over us all, and may escape both from the trials of this world and its allurements, which are still more dangerous, except when the peace of this world has the effect for which the apostle has directed us to pray, "That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."2 For if godliness and honesty be wanting, what is a quiet and peaceful exemption from the evils of the world but an occasion either of inviting men to enter, or assisting men to follow, a course of self-indulgence and perdition? Do you, then, ask for us what we ask for you, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. Let us ask this for each other wherever you are and wherever we are, for He whose we are is everywhere present.<br>
    7. I have sent you also other books which you did not ask, that I might not rigidly restrict myself to what you asked: -- my works on Faith in Things Unseen, on Patience, on Continence, on Providence, and a large work on Faith, Hope, and Charity. If, while you are in Africa, you shall read all these, either send your opinion of them to me, or let it be sent to some place whence it may be sent us by my lord and brother Aurelius, though wherever you shall be we hope to have  letters from you; and do you expect letters from us as long as we are able. I most gratefully received the things you sent to me, in which you deigned to aid me both in regard to my bodily health,3 since you desire me to be free from the hindrance of sickness in devoting my time to God, and in regard to my library, that I may have the means to procure new books and repair the old. May God recompense you, both in the present life and in that to come, with those favours which He has prepared for such as He has willed you to be. I request you now to salute again for me, as before, the pledge of peace entrusted to you, very dear to both of us.<br>

	[Hitherto the order followed in the arrangement of the letters has been the chronological. It being impossible to ascertain definitely the date of composition of thirty-nine of the letters, these have been placed by the Benedictine editors in the fourth division, and in it they are arranged under two principal divisions, the first embracing some controversial letters, and the second a number of those which were occasioned either by Augustin's interest in the welfare of individuals, or by the claims of official duty.]<br>
<br>
                             LETTER CCXXXII.<br>
<br>
	TO THE PEOPLE OF MADAURA, MY LORDS WORTHY OF PRAISE, AND BRETHREN MOST BELOVED, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING, IN REPLY TO THE LETTER RECEIVED BY THE HANDS OF BROTHER FLORENTINUS.<br>
<br>
    1. If, perchance, such a letter as I have received was sent to me by those among you who are Catholic Christians, the only thing at which I am surprised is, that it was sent in the name of the municipality, and not in their own name. If, however, it has pleased all or almost all of your men of rank to send a letter to me, I am surprised at the title "Father" and the "salutation in the Lord" addressed to me by you, of whom I know certainly, and with much regret, that you regard with superstitious veneration those idols against which your temples are more easily shut than your hearts; or, I should rather say, those idols which are not more truly shut up in your temples than in your hearts.1 Can it be that you are at last, after wise reflection, seriously thinking of that salvation which is in the Lord, in whose name you have chosen to salute me ? For if it be not so, I ask you, my lords worthy of all praise, and brethren most beloved, in what have I injured, in what have I offended your benevolence, that you should think it fight to treat me with ridicule rather than with respect in the salutation  prefixed to your letter ?<br>
    2. For when I read the words, "To Father Augustin, eternal salvation in the Lord," I was suddenly elated with such fulness of hope, that I believed you either already converted to the Lord Himself, and to that eternal salvation of which He is the author, or desirous, through our, ministry, to be so converted. But when I read the rest of the letter my heart was chilled. I inquired, however, from the bearer of the letter, whether you were already Christians or were desirous to be so. After I learned from his answer that you were in no way changed, I was deeply grieved that you thought it right not only to reject the name of Christ, to whom you already see the whole world submitting, but even to insult His name in my person; for I could not think of any other Lord than Christ the Lord in whom a bishop could be addressed by you as a father, and if there had been any doubt as to the meaning to be attached to your words, it would have been removed by the closing sentence of your letter, where you say plainly, "We desire that, for many years, your lordship may always, in the midst of your clergy, be glad in God and His Christ." After reading and pondering all these things, what could I (or, indeed, could any man) think but that these words were written either as the genuine expression of the mind of the writers, or with an intention to deceive ? If you write these things as the genuine expression of your mind, who has barred your way to the truth? Who has strewn it with thorns? What enemy has placed masses of rock across your path ? In fine, if you are desiring to come in, who has shut the door of our places of worship against you, so that you are unwilling to enjoy the same salvation with us in the same Lord in whose name you salute us? But if you write these things deceitfully and mockingly, do you, then, in the very act of imposing on me the care of your affairs, presume to insult, with the language of feigned adulation, the name of Him through whom alone I can do anything, instead of honouring Him with the veneration which is due to Him ?<br>
    3. Be assured, dearest brethren, that it is with inexpressible trembling of heart on your account that I write this letter to you, for I know how much greater in the judgment of God must be your guilt and your doom if I shall have said these things to you in vain. In regard to everything in the history of the human race which our forefathers observed and handed down to us, and not less in regard to everything connected with the seeking and holding of true religion which we now see and put on record for those who come after us, the Divine Scriptures have not been silent; so far from this, all things come to pass exactly according to the predictions of Scripture. You cannot deny that you see the Jewish people torn from the abodes of their ancestry, dispersed and scattered over almost every country: now, the origin of that people, their gradual increase, their losing of the kingdom,<br>
<br>
586<br>
<br>
their dispersion through all the world, have happened exactly as foretold. You cannot deny that you see that the word of the Lord, and the law coming forth from that people through Christ, who was miraculously born among their nation, has taken and retained possession of the faith of all nations: now we read of all these announced beforehand as we see them. You cannot deny that you see what we call heresies and schisms, that is, many cut off from the root of the Christian society, which by means of the Apostolic Sees, and the successions of bishops, is spread abroad in an indisputably world-wide diffusion, claiming the name of Christians, and as withering branches boasting of the mere appearance of being derived from the true vine: all this has been foreseen, predicted, and described in ScriptUre. You cannot deny that you see some temples of the idols fallen into ruin through neglect, others thrown down by violence, others closed, and some applied to other purposes; you see the idols themselves either broken to pieces, or burnt, or shut up, or destroyed, and the same powers of this world, who in defence of idols persecuted Christians, now vanquished and subdued by Christians, who did not fight for the truth but died for it, and directing their attacks and their laws against the very idols in defence of which they put Christians to death, and the highest dignitary of the noblest empire laying aside his crown and kneeling as a! suppliant at the tomb of the fisherman Peter.<br>
    4. The Divine Scriptures, which have now  come into the hands of all, testified long before: that all these things would come to pass. We rejoice that all these things have happened, with a faith which is strong in proportion to the discovery thereby made of the greatness of the authority with which they are declared in the sacred Scriptures. Seeing, then, that all these things have come to pass as foretold, are we, I ask, to suppose that the judgment of God, which we read of in the same Scriptures as appointed to separate finally between the believing and the unbelieving, is the only event in regard to which the prophecy is to fail ? Yea, certainly, as all these events have come, it shall also come. Nor shall there be a man of our time who shall be able in that day to plead anything in defence of his unbelief. For the name of Christ is on the lips of every man: it is invoked by the just man in doing justice, by the perjurer in the act of deceiving, by the king to confirm his rule, by the soldier to nerve himself for battle, by the husband to establish his authority, by the wife to confess her submission, by the father to enforce his command, by the son to declare his obedience, by the master in supporting his right to govern, by the slave in performing his duty, by the humble in quickening piety, by the proud in stimulating ambition, by the rich man when he gives, and by the poor when he receives an alms, by the drunkard at his wine-cup, by the beggar at the gate, by the good man in keeping his word, by the wicked man in violating his promises: all frequently use the name of Christ, the Christian with genuine reverence, the Pagan with reigned respect; and they shall undoubtedly give to that same Being whom they invoke an account both of the spirit and of the language in which they repeat His name.<br>
    5. There is One invisible, from whom, as the Creator and First Cause, all things seen by us derive their being: He is supreme, eternal, unchangeable, and comprehensible by none save Himself alone. There is One by whom the supreme Majesty utters and reveals Himself, namely, the Word, not inferior to Him by whom it is begotten and uttered, by which Word He who begets it is manifested. There is One who is holiness, the sanctifier of all that becomes holy, who is the inseparable and undivided mutual communion between this unchangeable Word by whom that First Cause is revealed, and that First Cause who reveals Himself by the Word which is His equal. But who is able with perfectly calm and pure mind to contemplate this whole Essence (whom I have endeavoured to describe without giving His name, instead of giving His name without describing Him), and to draw blessedness from that contemplation, and by sinking, as it were, in the rapture of such meditation, to become oblivious of self, and to press on to that the sight of which is beyond our sphere of perception; in other words, to be clothed with immortality, and obtain that eternal salvation which you were pleased to desire on my behalf in your greeting? Who, I say, is able to do this but the man who, confessing his sins, shall have levelled with the dust all the vain risings of pride, and prostrated himself in meekness and humility to receive God as his Teacher ?<br>
    6. Since, therefore, it is necessary that we be first brought down from vain self-sufficiency to lowliness of spirit, that rising thence .we may attain to real exaltation, it was not possible that this spirit could be produced in us by any method at once more glorious and more gentle (subduing our haughtiness by persuasion instead of violence) than that the Word by whom the Father reveals Himself to angels, who is His Power and Wisdom, who could not be discerned by the human heart so long as it was blinded by love for the things which are seen, should condescend . to assume out nature, and so to exercise and manifest His personality when incarnate as to make men more afraid of being elated by the pride of man, than of being brought low after the example of God. Therefore the Christ who is preached throughout the whole world is not<br>
587<br>
<br>
Christ adorned with an earthly crown, nor Christ rich in earthly treasures, nor Christ illustrious for earthly prosperity, but Christ crucified. This was ridiculed, at first, by whole nations of proud men, and is still ridiculed by a remnant among the nations, but it was the object of faith at first to a few and now to whole nations, because when Christ crucified was preached at that time, notwithstanding the ridicule of the nations, to the few who believed, the lame received power to walk, the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear, the blind to see, and the dead were restored to life. Thus, at length, the pride of this world was convinced that, even among the things of this world, there is nothing more powerful than the humility of God,1 so that beneath the shield of a divine example that humility, which it is most profitable for men to practise, might find defence against the contemptuous assaults of pride.<br>
    7. O men of Madaura, my brethren, nay, my fathers,2 I beseech you to awake at last: this opportunity of writing to you God has given to me. So far as I could, I rendered my service and help in the business of brother Florentinus, by whom, as God willed it, you wrote to me; but the business was of such a nature, that even without my assistance it might have been easily transacted, for almost all the men of his family, who reside at Hippo, know Florentinus, and deeply regret his bereavement. But the letter was sent by you to me, that, having occasion to reply, it might not seem presumptuous on my part, when the opportunity was afforded me by yourselves, to say something concerning Christ to the worshippers of idols. But I beseech you, if you have not taken His name in vain in that epistle, suffer not these things which I write to you to be in vain; but if in using His name you wished to mock me, fear Him whom the world formerly in its pride scorned as a condemned criminal, and whom the same world now, subjected to His sway, awaits as its Judge. For the desire of my heart for you, expressed as far as in my power by this letter, shall witness against you at the judgment-seat of Him who shall establish for ever those who believe in Him and confound the unbelieving. May the one true God deliver you wholly from the vanity of this world, and turn you to Himself, my lords worthy of all praise and brethren most beloved.<br>
<br>
                            LETTER CCXXXVII.<br>
    This letter was addressed to Ceretius, a bishop, who had sent to Augustin certain apocryphal writings, on which the Spanish heretical sect called Priscillianists 3 rounded some of their doctrines. Ceretius had especially directed his attention to a hymn which they alleged to have been composed by the Lord Jesus Christ, and given by Him to His disciples on that night on which He was betrayed, when they sang an" hymn" before going out to the Mount of Olives. The length of tile letter precludes its insertion here, but we believe it will interest many to read the few lines of this otherwise long-forgotten hymn, which Augustin has here preserved. They are as follows :--<br>
<br>
	"Salvare volo et salvari volo; Solvere volo et solvi volo; Ornate volo et ornari volo; Generari volo;<br>
	Cantare volo, saltate cuncti: Plangere volo, tundite vos omnes: Lucerna sum tibi, ille qui me vides;<br>
Janua sum tibi, quicunque me pulsas; Qui rides quod ago, tace opera mea;<br>
            Verbo illusi cuncta et non sum illusus in totum."<br>
<br>
The reader who ponders these extracts, and remembers the occasion on which the hymn is alleged to have been composed, will agree with us that Augustin employs a very unnecessary fulness of argument in devoting several paragraphs to demolish the claims advanced on its behalf as a revelation more profound and sacred than anything contained in the canonical Scriptures. Augustin also brings against the Priscillianists the charge of justifying perjury when it might be of service in concealing their real opinions, and quotes a line in which, as he had heard from some who once belonged to that sect, the lawfulness of such deceitful conduct was taught :--<br>
                 "Jura, perjura, secretum prodere noli."<br>
<br>
                              LETTER CCXLV.<br>
<br>
	TO POSSIDIUS,4 MY MOST BELOVED LORD AND VENERABLE BROTHER AND PARTNER IN THE SACERDOTAL OFFICE, AND TO THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM, AUGUSTIN AND THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM SEND GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. It requires more consideration to decide what to do with those who refuse to obey you, than to discover how to show them that things which they do are unlawful. Meanwhile, however, the letter of your Holiness has come upon me when I am exceedingly pressed with business, and the very hasty departure of the bearer has made it necessary for me to write you in reply, but has not given me time to answer as I ought to have done in regard to the matters on which you have consulted me. Let me say,<br>
588<br>
<br>
however, in regard to ornaments of gold and costly dress, that I would not have you come to a precipitate decision in the way of forbidding their use, except in the case of those who, neither being married nor intending to marry, are bound to consider only how they may please God. But those who belong to the world have also to consider how they may in these things please their wives if they be husbands, their husbands if they be wives;1 with this limitation, that it is not becoming even in married women to uncover their hair, since the apostle commands women to keep their heads covered.2 As to the use of pigments by women in colouring the face, in order to have a ruddier or a fairer complexion, this is a dishonest artifice, by which I am sure that even their own husbands do not wish to be deceived; and it is only for their own husbands that women ought to be permitted to adorn themselves, according to the toleration, not the injunction, of Scripture. For the true adorning, especially of Christian men and women, consists not only in the absence of all deceitful painting of the complexion, but in the possession not of magnificent golden ornaments or rich apparel, but of a blameless life.<br>
    2. As for the accursed superstition of wearing amulets (among which the earrings worn by men at the top of the ear on one side are to be reckoned), it is practised with the view not of pleasing men, but of doing homage to devils. But who can expect to find in Scripture express prohibition of every form of wicked superstition, seeing that the apostle says generally, "I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils,"3 and again, "What concord hath Christ with Belial?" 4 unless, perchance, the fact that he named Belial, while he forbade in general terms fellowship with devils, leaves it open for Christians to sacrifice to Neptune, because we nowhere read an express prohibition of the worship of Neptune ! Meanwhile, let those unhappy people be admonished that, if they persist in disobedience to salutary precepts, they must at least forbear from defending their impieties, and thereby involving themselves in greater guilt. But why should we argue at all with them if they are afraid to take off their earrings, and are not afraid to receive the body of Christ while wearing the badge of the devil ?<br>
    As to ordaining a man who was baptized in the Donatist sect, I cannot take the responsibility of recommending you to do this; it is one thing for you to do it if you are left without alternative, it is another thing for me to advise that you should do it.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
                 TO LAMPADIUS, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING,<br>
<br>
    1. On the subject of Fate and Fortune, by which, as I perceived when I was with you, and as I now know in a more gratifying and more reliable way by your own letter, your mind is seriously disturbed, I ought to write you a considerable volume; the Lord will enable me to explain it in the manner which He knows to be best fitted to preserve your faith. For it is no small evil that when men embrace perverse opinions they are not only drawn by the allurement of pleasure to commit sin, but are also turned aside to vindicate their sin rather than seek to have it healed by acknowledging that they have done wrong.<br>
    2. Let me, therefore, briefly remind you of one thing bearing on the question which you certainly know, that all laws and all means of discipline, commendations, censures, exhortations, threatenings, rewards, punishments, and all other things by which mankind are managed and ruled, are utterly subverted and overthrown, and found to be absolutely devoid of justice, unless the will is the cause of the sins which a man commits. How much more legitimate and right, therefore, is it for us to reject the absurdities of astrologers [mathematici], than to submit to the alternative necessity of condemning and rejecting the laws proceeding from divine authority, or even the means needful for governing our own families. In this the astrologers themselves ignore their own doctrine as to Fate and Fortune, for when any one of them, after selling to moneyed simpletons his silly prognostications of Fate, calls back his thoughts from the ivory tablets to the management and care of his own house, he reproves his wife, not with words only, but with blows, if he finds her, I do not say jesting rather forwardly, but even looking too much out of the window. Nevertheless, if she were to expostulate in such a case, saying: "Why beat me ? beat Venus, rather, if you can, since it is under that planet's influence that I am compelled to do what you complain of,"-- he would certainly apply his energies not to invent some of the absurd jargon by which he cajoles the public, but to inflict some of the just correction by which he maintains his authority at home.<br>
    3. When, therefore, any one, upon being reproved, affirms that Fate is the cause of the action, and insists that therefore he is not to be blamed, because he says that under the compulsion of Fate he did the action which is censured, let him come back to apply this to his own case, let him observe this principle in managing his own affairs: let him not chastise a dishonest servant; let him not complain of a disrespectful son; let him not utter threats against<br>
<br>
589<br>
<br>
a mischievous neighbour. For in doing which of these things would he act justly, if all from whom he suffers such wrong are impelled to Commit it by Fate, not by any fault of their own? If, however, from the fight inherent in himself, and the duty incumbent on him as the head of a family towards all whom for the time he has under his control, he exhorts them to do good, deters them from doing evil, commands them to obey his will, honours those who yield implicit obedience, inflicts punishment on those who set him at naught, gives thanks to those who do him good, and hates those who are ungrateful, -- shall I wait to prove the absurdity of the astrologers calculations of Fate, when I find him proclaiming, not by words but by deeds, things so conclusive against his pretensions that he seems to destroy almost with his own hands every hair on the heads of the astrologers?<br>
    If your eager desire is not satisfied with these few sentences, and demands a book which will take longer time to read on this subject, you must wait patiently until I get some respite from other duties; and you must pray to God that He may be pleased to allow both leisure and capacity to write, so as to set your mind at rest on this matter. I will, however, do this with more willing readiness, if your Charity does not grudge to remind me of it by frequent letters, and to show me in your reply what you think of this letter.<br>

                              LETTER CCL.<br>
<br>
	TO HIS BELOVED LORD AND VENERABLE BROTHER AND PARTNER IN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE, AUXILIUS,1 AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. Our son Classicianus, a man of rank, has addressed to me a letter complaining bitterly that he has suffered excommunication wrongfully at the hand of your Holiness. His account of the matter is, that he came to the church with a small escort suitable to his official authority, and begged of you that you would not, to the detriment of their own spiritual welfare, extend the privilege of the sanctuary to men who, after violating an oath which they had taken on the Gospel, were seeking in the house of faith itself assistance and protection in their crime of breaking faith; that thereafter the men themselves, reflecting on the sin which they had committed, went forth from the church, not under violent compulsion, but of their own accord; and that because of this transaction your Holiness was so displeased with him, that with the usual forms of ecclesiastical procedure you smote him and all his household with a sentence of excommunication.<br>
    On reading this letter from him, being very much troubled, the thoughts of my heart being agitated like the waves of a stormy sea, I felt it impossible to forbear from writing to you, to beg that if you have thoroughly examined your judgment I in this matter, and have proved it by irrefragable reasoning or Scripture testimonies, you will have the kindness to teach me also the grounds on which it is just that a son should be anathematized for the sin of his father, or a wife for the sin of her husband, or a servant for the sin of his master, or how it is just that even the child as yet unborn should lie under an anathema, and be debarred, even though death were imminent, from the deliverance provided in the layer of regeneration, if he happen to be born in a family at the time when the whole household is under the ban of excommunication. For this is not one of those judgments merely affecting the body, in which, as we read in Scripture, some despisers of God were slain with all their households, though these had not been sharers in their impiety. In those cases, indeed, as a warning to the survivors, death was inflicted on booties which, as mortal, were destined at some time to die; but a spiritual judgment, founded on what is written, "That which ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,"2 -- is binding on souls, concerning which it is said, "As the soul of the father is mine, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth it shall die."3<br>
    2. It may be that you have heard that other priests of great reputation have in some cases included the household of a transgressor in the anathema pronounced on him; but these could, perchance, if they were required, give a good reason for so doing. For my own part, although I have been most grievously troubled by the cruel excesses with which some men have vexed the Church, I have never ventured to do as you have done, for this reason, that if any one were to challenge me to justify such an act, I could give no satisfactory reply. But if, perchance, the Lord has revealed to you that it may be justly done, I by no means despise your youth and your inexperience, as having been but recently elevated to high office in the Church. Behold, though far advanced in life, I am ready to learn from one who is but young; and notwithstanding the number of years for which I have been a bishop, I am ready to learn from one who has not yet been a twelvemonth in the same office, if he undertakes to teach me how we can justify our conduct, either before men or before God, if we inflict a spiritual punishment on innocent souls because of another person's crime, in which they are not involved in the same way as they are involved in the original sin of Adam,<br>
<br>
590<br>
<br>
in whom "all have sinned." For although the son of Classicianus derived through his father, from our first parent, guilt which behoved to be washed away by the sacred waters of baptism, who hesitates for a moment to say that he is in no way responsible for any sin which his father may have committed, since he was born, without his participation? What shall I say of his wife? What of so many souls in the entire household? -- of which if even one, in consequence of the severity which included the whole household in the excommunication, should perish through departing from the body without baptism, the loss thus occasioned would be an incomparably greater calamity than the bodily death of an innumerable multitude, even though they were innocent men, dragged from the courts of the sanctuary and murdered. If, therefore, you are able to give a good reason for this, I trust that you will in your reply communicate it to me, that I also may be able to do the same; but if you cannot, what right have you to do, under the promptings of inconsiderate excitement, an act for which, if you were asked to give a satisfactory reason, you could find none?<br>
    3. What I have said hitherto applies to the case even on the supposition that our son Classicianus has done something which might appear to demand most righteously at your hands the punishment of excommunication. But if the letter which he sent to me contained the truth, there was no reason why even he himself (even though his household had been exempted from the stroke) should have been so punished. As to this, however, I do not interfere with your Holiness; I only beseech you to pardon him when he asks forgiveness, if he acknowledges his fault; and if, on the other hand, you, upon reflection, acknowledge that he did nothing wrong, since in fact the right rather lay on his side who earnestly demanded that in the house of faith, faith should be sacredly kept, and that it should not be broken in the place where the sinfulness of such breach of faith is taught from] day to day, do, in this event, what a man of, piety ought to do,-- that is to say, if to you as a man anything has happened such as was confessed by one who was truly a man of God in the words of the psalm, "Mine eye was discomposed by anger,"1 fail not to cry to the Lord, as] he did, "Have pity on me, O Lord, for I am weak,"2 so that He may stretch forth His right hand to you, rebuking the storm of your passion, and making your mind calm that you may see and may perform what is just; for, as it is written, "the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God."3 And think not that, because we are bishops, it is impossible for unjust passionate resentment to gain secretly upon us; let us rather remember that, because we are men, your life in the midst of temptation's snares is, beset with the greatest possible dangers. Cancel, therefore, the ecclesiastical sentence which, perhaps under the influence of unusual excitement, you have passed; and let the mutual love which, even from the time when you were a catechumen, has united him and you, be restored again; let strife be banished and peace invited to return, lest this man who is your friend be lost to you, and the devil who is your enemy rejoice over you both. Mighty is the mercy of our God; it may be that His compassion shall hear even my prayer, imploring of Him that my sorrow on your account may not be increased, but that rather what I have begun to suffer may be removed; and may your youth, not despising my old age, be encouraged and made full of joy by His grace! Farewell!<br>
<br>
    [Annexed to this letter is a fragment of a letter written at the same time to Classicianus; it is as follows: --<br>
<br>
    To restrain those who for the offence of one soul bind a transgressor's entire household, that is, a large number of souls, under one sentence of excommunication, and especially to prevent any one from departing this life unbaptized in consequence of such an anathema, -- also to decide the question whether persons ought not to be driven forth even from a church, who seek a refuge there in order that they may break the faith pledged to sureties, I desire with the Lord's help to use the necessary measures in our Council, and, if it be necessary, to write to the Apostolic See; that, by a unanimous authoritative decision of all, we may have the course which ought to be followed in these cases determined and established. One thing I say deliberately as an unquestionable truth, that if any believer has been wrongfully excommunicated, the sentence will do harm rather to him who pronounces it than to him who suffers this wrong. For it is by the Holy Spirit dwelling in holy persons that any one is loosed or bound, and He inflicts unmerited punishment upon no one; for by Him the love which worketh not evil is shed abroad Ln our hearts.4]<br>

<br>
	TO BENENATUS, MY MOST BLESSED LORD, MY ESTEEMED AND AMIABLE BROTHER AND PARTNER IN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE, AND TO THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM, AUGUSTIN AND THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH HIM SEND GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    The maiden1 about whom your Holiness wrote to me is at present disposed to think, that if she were of full age she would refuse every proposal of marriage. She is, however, so young, that even if she were disposed to marriage, she ought not yet to be either given or betrothed to any one. Besides this, my lord Benenatus, brother revered and beloved, it must be remembered that God takes her under guardianship in His Church with the design of protecting her against wicked men; placing her, therefore, under my care not so as that she can be given by me to whomsoever I might choose, but so as that she cannot be taken away against my will by any person who would be an unsuitable partner. The proposal which you have been pleased mention is one which, if she were disposed and prepared to marry, would not displease me; but whether she will marry any one,-- although for my own part, I would much prefer that she carried out what she now talks of,-- I do not in the meantime know, for she is at an age in which her declaration that she wishes to be a nun is to be received rather as the flippant utterance of one talking heedlessly, than as the deliberate promise of one making a solemn vow. Moreover, she has an aunt by the mother's side married to our honourable brother Felix, with whom I have. conferred in regard to this matter,--for I neither could, nor indeed should have avoided consulting him,--and he has not been reluctant to entertain the proposal, but has, on the contrary, expressed his satisfaction; but he expressed not unreasonably his regret that nothing had been written to him on the subject, although his relationship entitled him to be apprised of it. For, perhaps, the mother of the maiden will also come forward, though in the meantime she does not make herself known, and to a mother's wishes in regard to the giving away of a daughter, nature gives in my opinion the precedence above all others, unless the maiden herself be already old enough to have legitimately a stronger claim to choose for herself what she pleases. I wish your Honour also to understand, that if the final and entire authority in the matter of her marriage were committed to me, and she herself, being of age and willing to marry, were to entrust herself to me under God as my Judge to give her to whomsoever I thought best, -- I declare, and I declare the truth, in saying that the proposal which you mention pleases me meanwhile, but because of God being my Judge I cannot pledge myself to reject on her behalf a better offer if it were made; but whether any such proposal shall at any future time be made is wholly uncertain. Your Holiness perceives, therefore, how many important considerations concur to make it impossible for her to be, in the meantime, definitely promised to any<br>
One.<br>

                            LETTER CCLXIII.<br>
<br>
	TO THE EMINENTLY RELIGIOUS LADY AND HOLY DAUGHTER SAPIDA, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD.<br>
<br>
    1. The gift prepared by the just and pious industry of your own hands, and kindly presented by you to me, I have accepted, lest I should increase the grief of one who needs, as I perceive, much rather to be comforted by me; especially because you expressed yourself as esteeming it no small consolation to you if I would wear this tunic, which you had made for that holy servant of God your brother, since he, having departed from the land of the dying, is raised above the need of the things which perish in the using. I have, therefore, complied with your desire, and whatever be the kind and degree of consolation which you may feel this to yield, I have not refused it to your affection for your brother.� The tunic which you sent I have accordingly ac-<br>
<br>
592<br>
<br>
cepted, and have already begun to wear it before writing this to you. Be therefore of good cheer; but apply yourself, I beseech you, to far better and far greater consolations, in order that the cloud which, through human weakness, gathers darkness closely round your heart, may be dissipated by the words of divine authority; and, at all times, so live that you may live with your brother, since he has so died that he lives still.<br>
    2. It is indeed a cause for tears that your brother, who loved you, and who honoured you especially for your pious life, and your profession as a consecrated virgin, is no more before your eyes, as hitherto, going in and out in the assiduous discharge of his ecclesiastical duties as a deacon. of the church of Carthage, and that you shall no more hear from his lips the honourable testimony which, with kindly, pious, and becoming affection, he was wont to render to the holiness of a sister so dear to him. When these things are pondered, and are regretfully desired1 with all the vehemence of long-cherished affection, the heart is pierced, and, like blood from; the pierced heart, tears flow apace. But let your heart rise heavenward, and your eyes will cease to weep.2 The things over the loss of which you mourn have indeed passed away, for they were in their nature temporary, but their loss does not involve the annihilation of that love with which Timotheus loved [his sister] Sapida, and loves her still: it abides in its own treasury, and is hidden with Christ in God. Does the miser lose his gold when he stores it in a secret place? Does he not then become, so far as lies in his power, more confidently assured that the gold is in his possession when he keeps it in some safer hiding-place,where it is hidden even from his eyes? Earthly covetousness believes that it has found a safer guardianship for its loved treasures when it no longer sees them; and shall heavenly love sorrow as if it had lost for ever that which it has only sent before it to the garner of the upper world? O Sapida, give yourself wholly to your high calling, and set your affections s on things above, where, at the right hand of God, Christ sitteth, who condescended for us to die, that we, though we were dead, might live, and to secure that no man should fear death as if it were destined to destroy him, and that no one of those for whom the Life died should after death be mourned for as if he had lost life. Take to yourself these and other similar divine consolations, before which human sorrow may blush and flee away.<br>
    3. There is nothing in the sorrow of mortals over their dearly beloved dead which merits displeasure; but the sorrow of believers ought not to be prolonged. If, therefore, you have been grieved till now, let this grief suffice, and sorrow not as do the heathen, "who have no hope."4 For when the Apostle Paul said this, he did not prohibit sorrow altogether, but only such sorrow as the heathen manifest who have no hope. For even Martha and Mary, pious sisters, and believers, wept for their brother Lazarus, of whom they knew that he would rise again, though they knew not that he was at that time to be restored to life; and the Lord Himself wept for that same Lazarus, whom He was going to bring back from death;5 wherein doubtless He by His example permitted, though He did not by any precept enjoin, the shedding of tears over the graves even of those regarding whom we believe that they shall rise again to the true life. Nor is it without good reason that Scripture saith in the book of Ecclesiasticus: "Let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself;" but adds, a little further on, this counsel, "and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness. For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength."6<br>
    4. Your brother, my daughter, is alive as to the soul, is asleep as to the body: "Shall not he who sleeps also rise again from sleep?"7 God, who has already received his spirit, shall again give back to him his body, which He did not take away to annihilate, but only took aside to restore. There is therefore no reason for protracted sorrow, since there is a much stronger reason for everlasting joy. For even the mortal part of your brother, which has been buried in the earth, shall not be for ever lost to you; --that part in which he was visibly present with you, through which also he addressed you and conversed with you, by which he spoke with a voice not less thoroughly known to your ear than was his countenance when presented to your eyes, so that, wherever the sound of his voice was heard, even though he was not seen, he used to be at once recognised by you. These things are indeed withdrawn so as to be no longer perceived by the senses of the living, that the absence of the dead may make surviving friends mourn for them. But seeing that even the bodies of the dead shall not perish (as not even a hair of the head shall perish),8 but shall, after being laid aside for a time, be received again never more to be laid aside, but fixed finally in the higher condition of existence into which they shall have<br>
<br>
593<br>
<br>
been changed, certainly there is more cause for l thankfulness in the sure hope for an immeasurable eternity, than for sorrow in the transient experience of a very short span of time. This hope the heathen do not possess, because they know not the Scriptures nor the power of God,1 who is able to restore what was lost, to quicken what was dead, to renew what has been subjected to corruption, to re-unite things which have been severed from each other, and to preserve thenceforward for evermore what was originally corruptible and shortlived. These things He has promised, who has, by the fulfilment of other promises, given our faith good ground to believe that these also shall be fulfilled. Let your faith often discourse now to you on these things, because your hope shall not be disappointed, though your love may be now for a season interrupted in its exercise; ponder these things; in them find more solid and abundant consolation. For if the fact that I now wear (because he could not) the garment which you had woven for your brother yields some comfort to you, how much more full and satisfactory the comfort which you should find in considering that he for whom this was prepared, and who then did not require an imperishable garment, shall be clothed with incorruption and immortality!<br>
<br>
                            LETTER CCLXIX.<br>
<br>
	TO NOBILIUS, MY MOST BLESSED AND VENERABLE BROTHER AND PARTNER IN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE, AUGUSTIN SENDS GREETING.<br>
<br>
    So important is the solemnity at which your brotherly affection invites me to be present, that my heart's desire would carry my poor body to you, were it not that infirmity renders this impossible. I might have come if it had not been winter; I might have braved the winter if I had been young: for in the latter case tile warmth of youth would have borne uncomplainingly the cold of the season; in the former case the warmth of summer would have met with gentleness the chili languor of old age. For the present, my lord most blessed, my holy and venerable partner in the priestly office, I cannot undertake in winter so long a journey, carrying with me as I must the frigid feebleness of very many years. I reciprocate the salutation due to your worth, on behalf of my own welfare I ask an interest in gout prayers, and I myself beseech the Lord God to grant that the prosperity of peace may follow the dedication of so great an edifice to His sacred service.2<br>
