edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>Everyone knows that there is a selection of letters of St. Ambrose in the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2">Ante-Nicene,
Nicene, and Post-Nicene Fathers</a>.&nbsp; I was aware of translations of more,
which were in copyright, but while searching catalogues for out of copyright
letters, I stumbled across the translation of the complete letters in the old
Oxford Movement Library of the Fathers.</p>

<p>Like most people, I had hitherto supposed that all the texts translated in
that series had either be retranslated or else incorporated in the Ante-Nicene
Fathers series.&nbsp; It now became clear to me that this was not so, and I
searched out a list of all the volumes, which can be found elsewhere in this
collection as a tool for researchers.</p>

<p>The reason why the compilers of the Ante-Nicene Fathers collection did not
pick up this volume seems to be that it had only recently appeared.&nbsp;
Although prepared in the heyday of the Oxford Movement, the unknown translator
had died before it had been published.&nbsp; As the editors grew weary and the
project ground to a halt, various texts remained unpublished.&nbsp; These
appeared much later in the 19th century; this one almost 40 years later in
1881.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other translations have since been made.&nbsp; A complete translation, in a
different order, appeared in the Fathers of the Church series in 1954.&nbsp; Dr.
Mary Whitby has kindly emailed me to let me know that a new translation of book
10 of the letters, together with some additional letters and two political
orations,two orations, one on the death of Theodosius I and one on Valentinian II,
should appear in 2005 from the >Liverpool
University Press Translated Texts for Historians.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This should be warmly welcomed, and is undoubtedly much easier to read!&nbsp; The
TTH series contains many texts translated into English for the first time, and
is undoubtedly one of the most praiseworthy efforts of our times.</p>

<p>The Oxford Movement volume was complete, except that letters 5 and 6
concerning false accusations against a holy virgin, Indicia, were not
translated.&nbsp; The Latin of these was given at the end, since the topic was
rather indecent.</p>

<p>I began by transcribing all the notes and marginal notes; after doing about a
third of the volume with great labour, it became clear to me that I would not
complete the remainder that way, for lack of time.&nbsp; For these I omitted the
very copious biblical references given in the margins in the original.&nbsp; All
the footnotes and marginal notes in Latin are included, however.</p>
