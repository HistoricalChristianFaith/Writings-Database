<p><b><a name="letter31"></a>LETTER XXXI.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="small">Irenaeus had asked S. Ambrose whether God had greater love for those who had
believed from their early years than for those, who had been converted later in
life. In answering this question, S. Ambrose enters into the history of the
Jewish and Christian Churches, which he considers as set forth under the figures
of David's two wives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO IRENAEUS, GREETING.</p>
<p>1. You have wisely thought it a subject of inquiry, whether there be any
difference in God's love towards those who have believed from their childhood,
and those who have believed in the course of their youth or more advanced age;
for this also has not been past over nor left unnoticed in the sacred
Scriptures. For it is not without meaning that the Lord our God says to the
Prophet Joel, <i>Lament to me for the spouse girded with sackcloth and for the
husband of her youth, </i>expressing his grief for the Synagogue, who, before,
in her virginity, had been espoused to the Word of God, or, it may be, for a
soul which had fallen from her good deeds, that by the heinousness of her sins
she had incurred hatred, and through the defilement of impiety and the stains of
unbelief had become miserable and despised, and far removed from the grace of
that Spouse which had before been counted worthy to be told, <i>I will </i><A NAME="p214"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|214</SPAN></A> <i>
betroth thee unto Me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving
kindness and in mercies.</i></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Not without reason is she considered miserable, who has lost gifts
of so great a price, and suffered so grievous a loss of her dowry of virtues as
to be deprived of the Spouse of her virginity. For according to our merits the
Word of God either lives or dies in us; for if our desires and works are good,
the Word of God lives and acts in us: if our thoughts and actions are darksome,
the Sun of righteousness sets within us. And therefore He bids lamentation to be
made for such a soul. For as they have cause of congratulation and feasting with
whom the Bridegroom dwells, so that soul is to be mourned for, from whom the
Spouse has been taken, as it is written of the Apostles in the Gospel; for <i>when
the Bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then shall they fast in those
days.</i></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Thus too this soul, in former times when she possessed the Virgin
Word, had joy and gladness. And therefore she fasted not, because it was the
season of feasting and refreshment; the Bridegroom was present bestowing by His
presence the riches of plenty, stores of heavenly food, and dropping <i>wine,
whereby the hearts of men are made glad. </i>But after she lost the Bridegroom
by her acts, she is commanded to do penance in sackcloth for her sins, and to
bewail herself, because Christ, Who is the Virgin Word, died and was crucified
for her.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; If this soul was espoused from early age, and never bore any other
yoke, but from the beginning dedicated the maiden flower of her faith to Christ
and as a virgin was united to Him in early days in the mysteries of piety,
received a training in holiness as a heifer does the yoke; she is the very soul
of the ancient Jewish stock from the family of the patriarchs, who, had she kept
her course of faith without stumbling, would have been counted worthy of great
things, the Spouse of the Virginal Word, as she who lays hold of Wisdom, <i>and
as a mother shall she meet him, and receive him as a wife married of a virgin.</i></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The other likewise is procured from the Gentiles, and both are the
Spouse of the One Word, which is a great mystery. And this is set forth to you
in the book of <A NAME="p215"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|215</SPAN></A> Kings; since David had two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreeli-tess and Abigail whom
he obtained afterwards; the first more severe, the latter full of mercy and
grace, an hospitable and liberal soul, who saw the Father with open face, having
beheld His glory; she who received the divine dew of paternal Grace, as the
interpretation of the name signifies. Now what is the dew of the Father, but the
Word of God, Who has filled the hearts of all with the moisture of faith and
justice?</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Well therefore does the true David say to this soul what was said to
Abigail, <i>Blessed is the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet
me. </i>And again he says to her, <i>Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person. </i>Lastly in the Song of
Solomon these are the words of the Bridegroom to the Bride, <i>Let me see thy
countenance; let me hear thy voice.</i></p>
<p><i>7.&nbsp; </i>And at the time she was dismissed, for she had another
husband who in Hebrew was called Nabal, which in Latin means foolish, a man
harsh, inhospitable, uncourteous, ungrateful, who knew not how to repay good
offices; but after his death, she was <i>set free from the law of her husband, </i>and
the prophet David took her to wife. By this marriage the mystery of the Church
which was to be called from among the Gentiles is signified, for she, having
lost the husband to whom she had been married, became converted to Christ,
bringing with her a dowry of piety, of humility and faith, enriched also with
the patrimony of mercy.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; But in this place it is not this wife, but that Ahinoam, who was
evilly disposed towards her brother, wherefore her brother was made a trouble to
her, and in their person it is said, <i>thou makest us to be a bye-word among
the heathen, and that the people shake their heads at us. </i>The devil, finding
her off her guard, fell upon her as a lion, and deprived her of her charms,
rooted up <i>her vine and fig-tree </i>under which she used to repose, and
caused her fruit to wither.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; But now God, having compassion on them, thus dried up and withered
by drought, saith to the prophet, <i>Lament </i><A NAME="p216"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|216</SPAN></A> <i>
to Me for virgin girded with sackcloth and for the husband of her youth, </i>that
is to say, over the dead husband of this soul or of the Synagogue. And with her
He expostulates in another place, forasmuch as she had forgotten her resolution,
forgotten His grace, had wandered from discipline, and had lost her former
affections as a wife. Lastly therefore He reproves her with His words, calling
to mind and repeating her tenderness and her expressions of affection: 'Didst
Thou not call me one of Thy household, the parent and guide of Thy virginity.'</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Wherefore for this soul, to whom through her infidelity the Word of
God is dead, and this Virgin Word is dead also, He appoints grief and brings in
an Intercessor, that so she may be called to penitence, and may thereby earn
compassion. But she who is of prudent understanding and very beautiful to look
upon, was gained for him, like Abigail, in battle; her adversaries were
conquered, and her husband, he who, surrounded by spiritual wickedness,
struggled and fought not to lose his beautiful wife, being dead. On her her
victorious and loving Spouse confers sweetness and grace, cleansing her from all
that might obscure her beauty, and taking off from her the garments of her
captivity, that so, laying aside all the hairs of her head, that is, the curls
of sins, which seem to be superfluous parts of our person (for <i>if a man have
long hair it is a shame unto him), </i>she may strive to come <i>in the unity of
the faith, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ, </i>that she may lay aside all trouble of mind, and founded in love may
grow up in the Lord Jesus, and make increase of the whole body.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; This is that soul whom the Law shews to thee under the figure of a
beautiful woman, and <i>if thou seest her among the captives, and hast a desire
unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife, </i>it says to thee, <i>thou
shalt bring her home to thine house, </i>that thou mayest commit to her the
whole interior of thy house, the possession of all thy secrets, that thou mayest
take away her superfluities, and cut off her transgressions; and with a razor
not too sharp, lest it come to evil, may cut off the slough of thy passions, and
thy idle senses. Wherefore it is said, <i>she shall shave </i><A NAME="p217"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|217</SPAN></A>
<i>her head, </i>that so the <i>wise man's eyes </i>that <i>are in his head </i>may
meet with no hindrance. And <i>she shall remain, </i>it is said, <i>in thine
house a full month, </i>bewailing the sins of her nativity, and the lies of her
wicked father the devil, who would fain <i>gather what he hath not laid, </i>that
so, cleansed by the purification of this mystic number, she may obtain the keys
of marriage.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; And it is well said, <i>After that thou shalt go in unto her, </i>bidding
thee to enter wholly into thy soul, and collect thyself within her, and so dwell
in her that thou mayest be not in the flesh but in the spirit, and purpose to
associate her to thyself in the commerce of life, knowing that she will
communicate to thee of her goods, and that filled with her grace thou mayest
say, <i>I</i> <i>was a witty child, and had a good spirit; </i>and she may
answer thee, <i>I will take thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, and
unto the chamber of her that conceived me.</i></p>
<p>13.&nbsp; She then shall be thy life, she shall find thee and kiss thee. <i>And
it shall be, if thou hast no delight in her, </i>because she chastiseth her
body, and bringeth it into slavery, thou shalt not suffer her to be a slave,
that is, to the lusts of the body, nor subject her to the flesh, but suffer her
to remain free; thou shalt not alienate her, for this were to sell her, nor
shalt thou despise her, but shalt allow her to serve God in the chastity of
faith and sobriety of good works. Farewell: love me, for I love you.</p>

<p><b><a name="letter32"></a>LETTER XXXII. </b>[A.D.387.]</p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="small">S. Ambrose in this Letter applies the words of Jeremiah about the partridge
(Jer. xvii. 11.) to Satan, and from it sets forth the way in which Jesus Christ
has overcome him, and rescued man from his power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO IRENAEUS, GREETING.</p>
<p>1. <i>The partridge hath cried, she hath gathered what she hath not hatched </i><A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><i>. </i>From the conclusion of my last letter
<A NAME="p218"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|218</SPAN></A> I may borrow the opening of the ensuing. The question has been much mooted:
with a view therefore of solving it, let us consider what natural history tells
us of the nature of this bird. For it is the part of no little sagacity to
consider even this, for Solomon knew the nature <i>of beasts and of fowl, and of
creeping things and of fishes!</i></p>
<p><i>2.&nbsp; </i>Now this bird is said to be full of craft, fraud, and guile,
skilled in the ways of deceiving the fowler, and experienced in the arts of
turning him aside from her young ones; omitting no artful stratagem which may
draw off the pursuer from her nest and lurking place. And we know that on
observing his approach, she beguiles him until she has given her offspring the
signal and opportunity for flight. As soon as she perceives they have escaped,
she also withdraws herself, leaving her enemy deluded by her treacherous wiles.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is said also to be a bird which copulates indiscriminately, and
that the male bird rushes eagerly on the female, and burns with unrestrained
desires. Wherefore it has been thought suitable to compare this impure malicious
and deceitful creature with the adversary and circumventor of the human race,
with him who is the arch-deceiver and author of impurity.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>The partridge then cried, </i>he that is, who derives his name
from destroying<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>: even Satan, which in Latin means the adversary<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>.
He cried first in Eve, he cried in Cain, he cried in Pharoah, in Dathan, Abiram,
Corah. He cried in the Jews, when they demanded gods to be made for them, while
the law was being given to Moses. He cried again, when they said of the Saviour,
<i>Let Him be crucified, let Him be crucified, </i>and, <i>His blood be on us
and on our children. </i>He cried, when they required that a king should be
given them, that they might revolt from the Lord God their King. He cried in
every one who was vain and faithless.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And by these cries he gathered to himself a people whom he had not
created; for God made man after His own likeness and image, and the Devil drew
man to himself by the allurements of his voice: He gathered to himself the
nations of the Gentiles, <i>getting riches not by right</i><A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><i>.
</i><A NAME="p219"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|219</SPAN></A> <i> </i>Wherefore it is a common saying concerning the rich and covetous man, that he
is a partridge gathering riches not by right. But my Jesus, as a good Judge,
does all things with righteousness <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>,<i> </i>for He came saying, as
it is written, <i>I</i> <i>speak righteousness and judgement</i><sup><A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></sup> <i>of
salvation.</i></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; By that grace then He despoiled that partridge the Devil, took from
him the ill-gotten riches, even the multitude that followed Him, recalled from
error the souls of the Gentiles, and the minds of the nations that wandered from
the way. And since He knew that they were beguiled by the voice of the Devil,
and in order that He might Himself loose the bonds and chains of ancient error,
He cried first in Abel, the voice of whose blood cried out. He cried in Moses,
to whom He said, <i>Wherefore criest thou unto Me? </i>He cried in Joshua, He
cried in David, who says, <i>Unto Thee do I call, help me. </i>He cried too in
all the Prophets. Wherefore He says also to Isaiah, <i>Cry, </i>and Isaiah
answers, <i>What shall I cry? </i>He cried in Solomon, calling to all with a
very loud voice in the power of of Wisdom, <i>Come eat of my bread, and drink of
the wine which I have mingled. </i>He cried also in His Body, as the <i>Beam out
of the timber. </i>He cried that He might deceive and circumvent the lurking
Enemy, saying, <i>My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me. </i>He cried that
He might spoil him of his prey, replying to the thief, <i>Verily I say unto
thee, this day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise. </i>Wherefore when Jesus
cried, straightway that partridge was left by those whom he had gathered <i>in
the midst of his days.</i></p>
<p><i>7.&nbsp; </i>Wherefore some have thought that this also agrees with the
nature of the partridge, forasmuch as it steals the eggs of others, and hatches
them with its own body, seeking by this treachery to gain for itself the
offspring of others. But when she whose eggs have been stolen, or nest invaded,
or her young have been tempted by a fraudulent resemblance, and deceived by the
appearance of beauty, when she, I say, perceives this, she 'picks out the crow's
eyes <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>'<i> </i>as the saying is, and, being inferior in strength,
puts <A NAME="p220"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|220</SPAN></A> on and arms herself with cunning. And when all the labour she has bestowed on
their nurture has exhausted her store of food, and her young ones have begun to
grow up, she utters her cries, and calls to her offspring with the trumpet (as
it were) of affection. And they, roused by this natural sound, recognise their
mother, and desert their pretended parent. And thus, seeking to gather what he
has not hatched, he loses those whom he thought to bring up.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Not without need therefore was it that Jesus also cried; it was in
order that the whole universe which had been deceived by the voice, the
allurements, the art, the specious beauty of the partridge, and enticed by his
treacherous wiles, and had wandered from the true Author of their being, might
be recalled by the voice of her true Parent, might abandon this deceiver, and
desert him <i>in the midst of his days, </i>that is, before the end of this
world. From him the Lord Jesus has rescued us, and called us to eternal life.
Wherefore now, <i>being dead to the world we live to God.</i></p>
<p>9.&nbsp; When then this partridge shall have been completely forsaken by his
false children, then that foolish one whom God has chosen and who has confounded
the wise man, will be saved. Wherefore <i>if any man seemeth to be wise in this
world let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</i></p>
<p>Farewell my son, and love me, as indeed you do, for I love you.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
<p><b><a name="letter33"></a>LETTER XXXIII.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="small">S. Ambrose in this Letter explains more fully the text of Deut. (xxi. 15
&amp;c) which he had alluded to in Letter xxi, and makes the <i>two wives </i>represent
qualities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO IRENAEUS, GREETING.</p>
<p>1. In a previous letter I said that the soul ought to be delivered from its
adversaries, and a bond of life which shall be inseparable entered into with it.
And inasmuch as my discourse took as a proof of its assertion that passage<A NAME="p221"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|221</SPAN></A>
in the Book of Deuteronomy which speaks of the man who had two wives, one
beloved and the other hated, you seem to have felt much concern lest any one
should suppose this man had taken to himself two souls, which is impossible.</p>
<p>2. But you yourself know that sometimes, when Scripture uses allegory, it
refers some things to the figure of the Synagogue, some to that of the Church;
some things to the soul, others to the mystery of the Word, others to souls of
different kinds and qualities, which he who has spiritual discernment can
distinguish. And so I conceive that it is not two souls, but different qualities
of the same soul, which are treated of in the following chapter of the Law. For
there is an amiable kind of soul, which desires pleasure, which shuns labour,
shrinks from compunction, slights the judgments of God. It is amiable because it
seems gentle and sweet for the time, and one that soothes rather than distresses
the mind. But there is another severer kind, which is consumed with zeal for
God, which, like a strict wife, will not permit or suffer her consort to commit
whoredoms, allows no indulgence to the body, gives no licence to delight or
pleasure, renounces the hidden deeds of shame, devotes herself to arduous
labours and to severe perils.</p>
<p>3. If therefore both have borne children, <i>he may not, </i>it is said, <i>when
he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, make the son of the beloved
first</i><sup><A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></sup> <i>before the son of the hated, which is indeed the first.
</i>The meaning of which I conceive not to be so much a simple preference as
between two first ones, but rather a declaration that the son of the hated wife
alone has the prerogative of being first. Now the word 'primitives' means as
first-born <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>, and the firstborn are holy, for <i>every male that
openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord. </i>Nevertheless all
first-born are not holy, for Esau who was the first-born was not holy.</p>
<p>4. But the holy are the first-born, for it is written in Numbers; <i>Behold,
I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the
first-born that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel. For on the day
that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, I </i><A NAME="p222"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|222</SPAN></A> <i>hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel.
</i>Wherefore He took the
Levites for the first-born, as being holy, for we know that the holy are
first-born from the Epistle to the Hebrews, where it is written, <i>But ye are
come to Mount Sion, and unto the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
company of Angels and to the Church of the first-born. </i>Wherefore as the
first-born of the Church are holy, so also are the Levites, for they also are
the first-born. For it is not by the order of their birth but by the gift of
sanctification that they are holy; Levi being the third son of Leah and not the
first.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But he who is sanctified himself opens the womb. What womb? Hear the
words, <i>As soon as they are born they go astray. </i>As you have understood
the first-born who opens the womb, so understand here the womb of the good
mother, from which it is not saints, but sinners who go astray. But the Levites
are taken away from the midst of Israel, because they have nothing in common
with the people, whose earthly first-born are destroyed. The first-born of the
world are of another mother, from whose womb Paul was separated when he was
called to the grace of God. He received the Word Who is in the midst of our
hearts. Whence it is said also, <i>There standeth One among you. Whom ye know
not.</i></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; This digression then of ours from one part of the Law to the other,
for the purpose of shewing that the firstborn is not the son of the beloved,
that is of the more remiss and voluptuous wife, has not been needless, although
the words of the chapter before us express the same truth: <i>He may not make
the son of the beloved first-born before the son of the hated, which is indeed
the first-born. </i>He is indeed the first-born who is the holy son of a holy
mother; just as she is indeed the mother, from whose womb not her true sons but
sinners go astray. Wherefore the former is not the son of the true mother, nor
the true first-born, but as though he were so, subsistence is indeed provided
for him that he may not want, but he is not honoured, that he may become rich.
But the other has received double from all, that he may abound; just as in Genesis each of the patriarchs had
two changes of raiment given to them by <A NAME="p223"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|223</SPAN></A>
their brother Joseph, when they were sent back to their father to tell him
that he whom he had believed to be dead was found.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Thus the first-born has received the prerogative of inheritance, as
the Scripture says, <i>He is the beginning of his strength, the right of the
first-born is his. </i>Thus from the first-born Son of God the first-born are
holy, and from that beginning, (for He is the Beginning and the Ending,) the
beginning is called holy, the beginning is the son to whom the prerogative of
the first-fruits is due, according to that which was said to Abraham, <i>Cast
out this bondwoman and her son, for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir
with my son, even with Isaac.</i></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Now the Divine Oracle teaches us that this relates to the
inheritance of virtues rather than that of mercy, for the Lord says, <i>In all
that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy
seed be called. </i>What other inheritance was there in Isaac which could
ennoble his father, but that of sanctity? The son of the handmaid indeed he set
over the Gentiles, as bestowing upon him a simple portion of his patrimony, but
to the son of Sarah he gave a double portion, for on him he bestowed not only
temporal but also heavenly and eternal things.</p>
<p>Farewell: love me, for I love you.</p>

<p><b><a name="letter34"></a>LETTER XXXIV.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="small">Horontianus asks whether the soul is from heaven. S.Ambrose first refers him
to the Book of Esdras, and then dwells upon S. Paul's statement in Rom. viii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO HORONTIANUS <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>, GREETING.</p>
<p>1. You have enquired of me whether the soul is formed of a heavenly
substance; for you are too well instructed <A NAME="p224"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|224</SPAN></A>
to suppose that the soul is made of blood or fire or any harmony of nerves,
as the common herd of philosophers believe, nor as that patrician sect of them,
the descendants of Plato assert, does that which moves of itself and is not
moved by others appear to you to be the soul, nor indeed have you approved that
fifth kind of element which the keen genius of Aristotle has introduced, namely
a kind of <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A><sup><i> </i></sup>perfection of which the essence of the soul might
be (as it were) framed and compounded.</p>
<p>2. On this subject I advise you to read the book of Esdras, who despised
these trifles of the philosophers, and with a deeper wisdom which he had
gathered from Revelation, pointed out that the soul is of a nobler substance.</p>
<p>3. The Apostle also, though he has not said it in so many words, has yet
given us to understand, like a good master and spiritual husbandman calling
forth the faculties of his disciples by the hidden seeds of doctrine, that our
souls are of a better creation and a more excellent nature. For when he says
that <i>the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly but by reason of
Him Who hath subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall
be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
sons of God, </i>he shews that the grace of souls is not small, seeing that by
their strength and excellence mankind rises to the adoption of the sons of God,
having within itself that which is given to it to make it in the likeness and
image of God. For souls are not perceived by truth, nor are they seen by the
bodily eye, wherefore they bear upon them the likeness of this incorporeal and
invisible nature, and excel in their substance corporeal and sensible qualities.
<i>For the things that are seen are temporal, </i>they represent and are united
to things that are temporal, but the things that are not seen are united to the
Eternal and Chief Good, <i>in Him they live and move and have their being, </i>and
suffer not themselves, if they are wise, to be separated or divided from Him.</p>
<p>4. Every soul therefore, seeing herself shut up in the prison-house of the
body, if it be not debased by her connexion with this earthly habitation, groans
under the burthen of the body to which she is joined; <i>for the </i><A NAME="p225"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|225</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN><i>corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down
the mind that museth upon many things, </i>knowing also that she walks <i>by
faith not by sight, </i>she is willing <i>to be absent from the body to be
present with the Lord.</i></p>
<p>5. Let us consider then how <i>the creature hath been made subject to vanity,
not </i>indeed <i>willingly, </i>but by the Divine ordinance, which has
appointed that our souls should be united to our bodies on account of their
hopes, in order that, hoping for good, they should make themselves worthy of a
heavenly recompense. <i>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
Christ, that every one may receive the things belonging to the body</i><sup><A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></sup>.
Every man's soul must therefore consider that she will be rewarded according to
deserts of life. And he says well <i>the things belonging to the body, </i>that
is to say, the body which was assigned to her to govern, that if she have
governed it well she may receive the reward for the sake of which she was
subjected in hope, but if ill, she may be punished, forasmuch as she did not
trust in God, nor aspire to that adoption of sons, and to the liberty of true
glory.</p>
<p>6. So then the Apostle has taught that man is a creature subject to vanity.
For what is so truly the man as his soul? of its companions he says, <i>For we
that are in this tabernacle do groan being burthened. </i>David also says, <i>Man
is like a thing of nought, </i>and, <i>livery man living is altogether vanity. </i>Wherefore
the life of man in this world is vanity, to which vanity the soul is subject.
And when a holy man doeth the things of the body, he doeth them not willingly
but <i>by reason of Him Who hath subjected the same in hope, </i>he does them
for obedience sake. From this example of the soul then let us proceed to the
other creatures.</p>
<p><i>7. </i>Consider the sun the moon and the stars; these heavenly luminaries,
although they shine with an excellent brightness, are yet but creatures, and
rise and set in performance of their daily task, obeying the ordinance of the
eternal Creator, dispensing the radiance wherewith they are clothed, and giving
light by night and by day. As often as the sun is obscured by clouds, as often
as is it hidden <A NAME="p226"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|226</SPAN></A> by the interposition of the earth, or when the rays of its light are
intercepted, eclipses occur, and, as the Scripture saith, <i>The moon knoweth
her going down</i><sup><A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A></sup><i>. </i>She knows when she shines with a full, and when
with a diminished orb. The stars also are overclouded and disappear, while going
through the service of this earthly ministry, not willingly indeed but in hope;
for they hope for the reward of this their toil from Him Who subjected them.
Wherefore they go through it for His sake, that is, to do His will.</p>
<p>8. Nor is it surprising that they bear it with patience, knowing that their
Lord, the Creator of all things in heaven and in earth, took upon Him our frail
body and our servile state. Should not they then patiently bear the bondage of
their corruption, seeing that the Lord of all humbled Himself even to death for
the whole world, took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made the sin of
the world, nay even a curse for us? Wherefore the heavenly bodies although they
groan in that they are subject to the vanity of this world, yet follow the
example of His goodness, and console themselves with the expectation of being <i>delivered
from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of glory, </i>when the adoption
of the sons of God, that is, the redemption of all men, shall have arrived. For
when <i>the fulness of the Gentiles shall be come in, </i>then <i>all Israel
shall be saved. </i>For what people will He not pardon when He even pardons that
persecuting people, who said, <i>Crucify Him, crucify Him, </i>and, <i>His blood
be on us and on our children. </i>But since even the heavenly creation is
subject to vanity, albeit in hope, will not He Who is ' truly Mercy itself and
the Redeemer of the world, suffer even the perfidy and insolence into which
these men through the vanity of the world have fallen to obtain pardon?</p>
<p>9. To conclude then, both this great and glorious sun, and this moon which is
not obscured by the shades of night, and these stars which are the garniture of
the heaven, all these now suffer <i>the bondage of corruption, </i>for all
creatures are corruptible, and the heavens shall perish and <i>the heaven and
earth pass away. </i>But hereafter the sun and moon and the stars of heaven
shall rest in the glory of <A NAME="p227"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|227</SPAN></A> the sons of God, when God shall be <i>all in all, </i>He Who now in His
immensity and mercy is in thee and in us.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; And shall we not believe that the Angels themselves, who in the
toils of this world fulfil divers ministeries, as we read in the Revelation of
S. John, do not also groan when made the ministers of vengeance and destruction?
Seeing that their life is blessed, would they not rather pass it in* their
ancient state of tranquillity than be interrupted by the infliction of vengeance
on our sins? They who rejoice in the salvation of one sinner must surely groan
over the miseries of so grievous sins.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; If therefore the creatures and powers of heaven suffer the bondage
of corruption, but still in hope, that hereafter they may rejoice on our behalf
and together with us, let us also alleviate the sufferings of this present time
by the hope and expectation of future glory. Farewell, my son; love me, for I
love you.</p>

<p><b><a name="letter35"></a>LETTER XXXV.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="small">In this Letter S. Ambrose continues his comment on the passage of S. Paul,
especially on the 'groans of creation.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO HORONTIANUS.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; My former Letter was a reply to your inquiry; this is a part of my
answer, supplemental not contradictory to the former. In reviewing the latter
part of the passage I was struck, I confess, with his adding, <i>we know that
every creature groaneth, </i>seeing that previously he had said without any
addition, <i>The creature was made subject to vanity. </i>For he said not every
creature, but, <i>the creature was made subject. </i>And again he says, <i>Because
the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption. </i>But
in the third place he adds that <i>every creature groaneth together.</i></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Now what does this addition mean? It means haply <A NAME="p228"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|228</SPAN></A>
that every creature is not <i>subject to vanity, </i>and therefore every
creature will not be <i>delivered from the bondage of corruption. </i>For why
should that be delivered which is free and secure from the subjection of vanity
and the bondage of that corruption? But they all groan together not in their own
but in our pangs, and haply are in travail together of the Spirit of Salvation,
the Spirit of sweetness, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, that in
the redemption of the human race they may attain to a common joy and gladness.
So then either because of their charity they all groan for our labour, or for us
as a member of their body, whose head is Christ. But you may understand this as
you please, either as we have said, or simply that every creature groans and
travails together.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And now let us consider what follows. <i>And not only they, but
ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves
groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of the
body. </i>We are taught in the previous passage what the adoption of sons is;
therefore, in order to explain its meaning, to that passage we must recur.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>He who through the Spirit, </i>says S. Paul, <i>mortifies the
deeds of the body shall live. </i>Nor is it surprising that he should live,
since he who has the Spirit of God, becomes the son of God. Wherefore he is the
son of God that he may receive not the spirit of bondage, but the spirit of
adoption of sons; to the intent that the Holy <i>Spirit may bear witness with
our spirit that we are the children of God. </i>But this is the testimony of the
Holy Spirit, that He it is Who cries in our hearts, <i>Abba Father, </i>as it is
written to the Galatians. There is also the great testimony that we are the sons
of God; namely that we are <i>heirs of God and</i></p>
<p><i>joint heirs with Christ. </i>Now he is joint heir with Him, who is
glorified together with Him, and he is glorified together with Him who by
suffering for Him suffers together with Him.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And in order to encourage us to suffer, he adds that all things
which we suffer fall far below and are not worthy to be compared with the
recompense of our labours, the reward of future good, which shall be revealed in
us, when <A NAME="p229"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|229</SPAN></A> we shall be formed anew after the Image of God, and shall be worthy to behold
His Glory face to face.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; And to exalt the greatness of this future revelation, he adds that
the creation also waits for this revelation of the sons of God, which now is
made subject to vanity, not willingly, but in hope, because it hopes for the
reward of its ministry from Christ, or else because it also will be <i>delivered
from the bondage of corruption, </i>and received into <i>the glorious liberty of
the sons of God, </i>that there may be one liberty of the creation and of the
sons of God, when their glory shall have been revealed. But now, so long as this
revelation is delayed, the whole creation groans together, looking for the glory
of our adoption and redemption, already travailing with that Spirit of
salvation, and willing to be delivered from the servitude of vanity.</p>
<p><i>7.&nbsp; </i>And to this the Apostle has conjoined the groans of the
saints, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, for they groan also. Of their
own merits they are indeed secure, but since the redemption of the whole body of
the Church is still future, they suffer together with it. For seeing that the
members of this our body still suffer, shall not the other members, although
higher, sympathize with the suffering members of one and the same body?</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; And this, I suppose, is why the Apostle has said that the <i>Son
Himself shall be subject unto Him that put all things under Him, </i>for they
who still labour are not yet subject, and in these perhaps Christ still thirsts,
in these is still hungry, in these is still naked, in that they do not fulfil
the word of God, nor put on Christ, Who is the Garment of believers, and the
Robe of the faithful. They also in whom He is sick still need medicine, and
therefore are not yet subdued, for this subjection is of strength not of
weakness : again, in those who are strong and obey the commands of God, the Son
of God is subject. But now His travail is greater in those who do not succour
those who are toiling, than in those who still require aid themselves. And this
is the pious and true meaning of the subjection of the Lord Jesus, Who will
subject Himself, to the intent <i>that God might be all in all.</i></p>
<p><i>9.&nbsp; </i>We have received the Apostle's meaning, let us now <A NAME="p230"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|230</SPAN></A>
consider who are they that <i>have the first-fruits of the Spirit. </i>With
this view let us inquire what is intended under the name of first-fruits or of
beginning, <i>Thou shalt not delay, </i>it is said, <i>to offer the first of thy
ripe fruits, and of thy liquors; </i>further on, <i>The first of the
first-fruits of thy lands thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God. </i>First-fruits
and tenths are different, first-fruits are of greater merit, an act of pious
consecration. And on this account Abel pleased God, for he delayed not to offer
his gift, but offered of the first-fruits of his flock. Although some suppose
that there is a difference between <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><i> </i>first-fruits and
first-born<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>, in that on gathering in the crops, the beginning, so to
speak, of all kinds in the threshing floor are offered, while the first reaping
of the harvest is offered to the Lord; but of this we will speak in another
place. But by the offering of the first-fruits, the whole harvest appears to be
sanctified, but the first-fruits themselves are the most holy.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; In like manner the saints are the first-fruits of the Lord, and the
chief are the Apostles, <i>for God hath set in the Church first Apostles, </i>who
have prophesied many things and preached the Lord Jesus, for they first received
Him. Simeon too received Him, and the prophet Zacharias, John his son,
Nathanael, <i>in whom there was no guile, </i>who rested under the fig tree,
Joseph also who was called just, who buried Him. These are the first-fruits of
our faith, nevertheless the nature of other seeds is the same as that of the
first-fruits, although in some there is less grace, for <i>God is able of these
stones to raise up children to Abraham.</i></p>
<p>11.&nbsp; You have an example in the Lord Jesus Himself. In the resurrection
of the dead He is called <i>the first-born from the dead. </i>The Apostle also has called Him the first-fruits; <i>In
Christ shall all be made alive, but every man in his own order, Christ the
first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's, who have believed in His coming.
</i>His body is as truly a body as our own, nevertheless He is called the
first-born from the dead, because He rose first; and He is called the
first-fruits because He is holier than all the other fruits, and they by union
with Him are hallowed , also. He also as <i>the Image of the invisible God </i>is
the <A NAME="p231"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|231</SPAN></A> Head of those found after that Image; in Him according to His Divinity there
is nothing corporeal, nothing temporary; for <i>He is the brightness of His
Father's glory, and the express Image of His Person. </i>But in our desire to
explain the meaning of first-fruits we have greatly extended the length of our
letter.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Now the Apostles are our first-fruits, chosen from all the
first-fruits of that time; to them it is said, <i>And greater things than these
shall ye do, </i>for the Grace of God hath poured itself into them. These, I
say, groaned, waiting for the redemption of the whole body, and they still
groan, because many are still toiling, who are yet tossing on the sea. Just as,
if a man is reaching the higher shore, but the waves still dash up to his
middle, he groans and is in travail until he be wholly out of danger. Verily he
groans, who still says to us, <i>Who is weak, and I am not weak?</i></p>
<p>13.&nbsp; We need not then to be perplexed by the words, <i>We, which have
the first-fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves, waiting for the
adoption, to wit the redemption of our body, </i>for the sense is plain,
forasmuch as they, having the first-fruits of the Spirit, groan, waiting for the
adoption of sons. This adoption of sons is the redemption of the whole body,
when he who is to be the son of God by adoption shall see face to face that
Divine and Eternal Good; for there is the adoption of sons in the Church of God,
when the Spirit cries, <i>Abba, Father, </i>as it is written to the Galatians.
But this will be perfected when all shall rise again in incorruption power and
glory who are counted worthy to see the Face of God, for then the human race
will judge itself to be truly redeemed. And so the Apostle boasts, saying, <i>For
we are saved by hope. </i>For hope saves, as also faith, whereof it is said, <i>Thy
faith hath saved thee.</i></p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Therefore the creature which <i>is made subject to vanity not
willingly but in hope, </i>is saved by hope; just as Paul too, knowing that <i>to
die was gain </i>to him, that he might be freed from the body and be with
Christ, remained in the flesh for their sakes whom he wished to win to Christ.
Now what is hope but the expectation of things future? Wherefore he says, <i>But
the hope that is seen is not hope. </i><A NAME="p232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For it is not what is seen but what is unseen that is eternal, <i>for what a
man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? </i>The things that we see we seem to
possess, how then can we hope for that which we already possess? Thus none of
those things which we hope for can we see; <i>eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
the things that God hath prepared for them that love Him.</i></p>
<p>15. Wherefore, if that which is seen cannot be hoped for, it is not well to
read as some do, 'for <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> because any one sees a thing he also hopes
for it;' unless it may be understood thus, 'for that which any one sees, why
does he also hope for or expect it?' For most true it is that we hope for that
which we see not, and therefore, although it seem to be absent from us, we still
look for it in patience; <i>I</i> <i>waited patiently for the Lord, and He
inclined unto me. </i>And we wait patiently, because <i>the Lord is good unto
them that wait for Him. </i>And it seems to agree with this, that through
patience He has given it back to us. We wait for the things which we hope for,
but see not. For he does much who hopes and looks for those things which are not
seen, and endures because he directs his mind to that which is.</p>
<p>16. Now it is well said that <i>hope that is seen is not hope, </i>referring
to the power and honour and riches of this world. You may see a man
distinguished by his retinue and equipages, but he has not hope in his equipages
which are seen. Nor is hope in the firmament of heaven, but in the Lord of
heaven. The Chaldaean has not hope in the stars which he watches; nor the rich
man in his possessions or the avaricious man in usury; but he hath hope who
places his hope in Him Whom he sees not, that is, in the Lord Jesus, Who stands
in the midst of us, yet is not seen. Finally, <i>eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. </i><A NAME="p233"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|233</SPAN></A> <i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class="small">S.Ambrose continues, in reply to a question of Horontianus, his discussion of
the passage of S. Paul, and explains what are his ' groanings unutterable.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO HORONTIANUS.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Our letters are so linked together that we seem to be holding actual
conversation with one another, so well do you with your question and I with my
explanations supply subject matter for our correspondence.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; You have intimated your doubt of what spirit it is said that he <i>maketh
intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered. </i>Let us then refer
to what has gone before, that the passage may make plain what we are seeking. <i>Likewise,
</i>it is said, <i>the Spirit helpeth our infirmities. </i>Does it not seem to
you that this is the Holy Spirit, for He is our Helper, as He to Whom it is
said, <i>Thou hast been my succour, leave me not neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation?</i></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; For what other Spirit could teach Paul how to pray? The Spirit of
Christ, like Christ Himself, teaches His disciples to pray, for who could teach
us, after Christ, but His Spirit, Whom He sent to teach us, and to direct our
prayers, <i>for we pray with the Spirit and we pray with the understanding also.
</i>That the understanding may pray well, the Spirit goes before and <i>leads it
forth into the right way, </i>so as to prevent carnal things, or what either
falls below or exceeds its strength, from secretly stealing over it. <i>For the
manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. </i>It is
written also, Seek great things, and small things shall be added unto you; seek
heavenly things, and earthly things shall be added unto you.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Wherefore He wishes us to seek greater things, not to linger upon
earth. And He knows what to bestow upon us, <i>dividing unto every man severally
as He will. </i>Sometimes, knowing our capacity, which we are ignorant of, He
says to us, <i>Ye cannot receive it now. </i>I ask for myself the <A NAME="p234"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|234</SPAN></A>
sufferings of martyrdom, <i>the </i>Holy <i>Spirit is willing, </i>but sees
the weakness of my flesh, and lest, while I seek for greater things I should
lose what is less, says to me, 'Thou canst not bear this.<sup>'</sup> What
opportunities have I not had, and yet when near the goal I have been held back <sup><A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></sup>.
The good physican knows what food is suitable to each disease, and to each
season, for the benefit of health. Sometimes food seasonably taken restores
health; but if a man eat food unseasonably or of an improper kind, it is
dangerous to him.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Therefore since we know not what to pray for, nor how to pray, the
Holy Spirit prays for us; for He is the Spirit of Jesus our Advocate, and He
prays with groans unutterable, for Christ also mourns for us. And God the Father
says, <i>My bowels, My bowels, I am pained at the very heart. </i>We often read
too of Him as being indignant and grieved. He groans to take away our sins, and
to teach us to do penance. For there are pious groans, and of prevailing power
with God, whereof the Prophet speaks, <i>And my groaning is not hid from Thee. </i>For
he did not hide himself, like Adam, but said, Behold I am the shepherd, <i>but
these sheep, what have they done? it is I that have sinned, let Thine hand be on
me.</i></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Hence then cometh the groaning of the Spirit of God, and those
groans of the Prophet<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>, truly unutterable because they are divine. So
those words which Paul heard in heaven are <i>unspeakable, which it is not
lawful for a man to utter, </i>but what is hidden from man is known to God. Now
He Who is the Searcher of hearts knows all things, but the things which He
searches are those which the Spirit hath cleansed. God therefore knoweth what
the Spirit prays for, and what is the wisdom of the Spirit Which intercedes for
the saints, as it is written, <i>For the Spirit maketh intercession for us. </i>For
those for whom Christ suffered, and whom He cleansed by His Blood, for them the
Spirit also intercedes.</p>

  <p class="small">Simplician, to whom this and the following Letters, and several later ones,

learned and yet simple-minded man. He was older than S. Ambrose, who speaks in

in the early days of his episcopate, and possibly, as the Benedictine Editors,

</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO SIMPLICIAN, GREETING.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When we were lately conversing together, in the intimacy of an
old-standing affection, you let me see that you were much pleased by my taking a
passage from the writings of the Apostle Paul to preach upon to the people. You
said further that this was the case, because the depth of his counsels is
difficult to grasp, while the loftiness of his sentiment rouses the audience,
and stimulates the preacher; and also because his discourses are so fully, for
the most part, the interpreters of his meaning, that the expounder of them finds
nothing to add of his own, and, if he would say ought, fills the part of a
critic rather than of a preacher.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; However since I recognize herein the feelings of long friendship,
and what is still more precious, the tenderness of your paternal regard, (for in
length of attachment many may participate, but in paternal love they cannot;)
since moreover you consider that I have already done what you ask
satisfactorily, I will comply with what you desire, and that the more, as I am
admonished and stimulated by my own example, an example not difficult for me to
follow, <A NAME="p236"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|236</SPAN></A> since I shall imitate no great one, but myself only, thus returning to my own
humble customs.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; As to the plan pursued in my discourse, seeing that the image and
character of the blessed life is delineated therein, I think I have so arranged
the argument of it that it will not be disapproved by others, certainly not by
yourself who are so partial to me, although it is more difficult to satisfy your
judgment than theirs, only your affection softens its severity and renders it
more indulgent to me.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Now this Letter, written as it is in your absence, has for its
subject the sentence of the Apostle Paul, who calls us from slavery into
liberty, saying, <i>Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the servants of men, </i>shewing
that our liberty lies in the knowledge of wisdom. This opinion has been bandied
to and fro by philosophers in energetic discussions, while they assert that
every wise man is free and every fool a slave.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But this was said long before by the son of David, <i>The fool
changeth as the moon. </i>The wise man on the other hand is not dispirited by
fear, nor changed by power, nor exalted by prosperity, nor cast down by sadness;
for where wisdom is, there also is strength of mind, constancy, and fortitude.
Now the wise man remains the same in mind, neither depressed nor exalted by the
vicissitudes of things, he is not <i>tossed to and fro as a child, and carried
about with every wind of doctrine, </i>but continues perfect in Christ, grounded
in charity, rooted in faith. Hence he is not conscious of failure, he knows not
the various losses which befal the soul, but <i>shall shine forth as the Sun of
righteousness Who shines in the kingdom of His Father.</i></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; But let us now consider from what source Philosophy more fully
derived this, from what discipline and wisdom of the Patriarchs. Did it not come
first from Noah who, perceiving that his son Ham had foolishly derided the
nakedness of his father, cursed him in these words, <i>Cursed be Ham </i><sup><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A></sup>,
<i>a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren, </i>and set his brethren
as lords over him, seeing that they had wisely deemed their fathers old age
worthy of honour?</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Did not also that source of all good discipline, Jacob, <A NAME="p237"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|237</SPAN></A>
who on account of his wisdom was preferred to his elder brother, instil into
the breasts of all the riches of this copious subject? So also the pious father,
whose paternal affection was equally strong towards his two sons, although his
judgment varied, (for while the ties of blood sway the affections, our judgments
are formed according to desert,) and who therefore dispensed to the one grace,
to the other mercy, to the wise grace, to the foolish mercy, seeing that Esau
could not raise himself to virtue by his own proper strength nor make progress
spontaneously, blessed him in rendering him the subject and servant of his
brother, shewing thereby that folly was so much worse than slavery that slavery
itself is a remedy for it; because a fool cannot govern himself, and unless he
has some director he falls by his own will.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; His father therefore, loving him and careful for his welfare, made
him the servant of his brother that he might be ruled by his counsels. And thus
wise rulers are given to an indiscreet nation, that by their vigour they may
guide the weakness of the people, ruling them by a show of power, and by this
weight of authority constraining them against their wills to obey those wiser
than themselves, and to submit to the laws. On the foolish son therefore he laid
a yoke as on one untamed, and to him who had said he would live by his sword he
denied even freedom; that he might not fall away through presumption he set his
brother over him, that being subdued by his authority and governance he might
make progress towards conversion. And since there are two kinds of service, (for
that which proceeds from necessity is weaker, that from free will stronger, for
that good is more transcendent which proceeds not from necessity but from free
will,) he therefore first laid upon him the yoke of necessity, and afterwards
imparted to him the blessing of voluntary subjection.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; It is not then nature which makes a person a slave, but folly; not
manumission which sets free, but discipline. Esau was born free, and was made a
servant, Joseph was sold into slavery, and then elected to power, to rule over
those who bought him. He disdained not to be sedulous and obedient, but he
maintained the height of virtue, he <A NAME="p238"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|238</SPAN></A>
preserved the liberty of innocence, the dignity of integrity. The Psalmist
therefore says well, <i>Joseph was sold to be a bond-servant; they humbled his
feet in fetters. He was sold, </i>it is said, <i>to be a bond-servant, </i>but
they could not make him a bond-servant; <i>they humbled his feet, </i>not his
soul.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; For how was that soul humbled of which it is said: <i>His soul
pierced the iron? </i>For while sin pierces the souls of others, (for <i>the
iron </i>means sin, which has a penetrating power,) the soul of holy Joseph was
so far from being vulnerable by sin that it pierced through sin itself. The
blandishments of his mistress' charms moved him not, and with reason was he
insensible to the flames of lust, seeing that he was consumed by the brighter
fire of Divine grace. It is therefore well said of him also, <i>The word of the
Lord inflamed him; </i>for thereby <i>he quenched the fiery darts of the Devil.</i></p>
<p>11.&nbsp; How was he a bond-servant who directed the princes of the people to
store up the corn, that thus they might forestall and provide for future dearth?
Or how was he a bond-servant, who gained the whole land, and reduced all the
Egyptians to bondage? And this, not in order to impose upon them the condition
of an ignoble bondage, but that he might establish a tribute from all but the
lands of the priesthood, which he preserved free from tribute, that among the
Egyptians also respect for the priesthood might be held inviolable.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; His being sold then did not make him a slave; for though of a truth
he was sold to merchants, yet, if you regard price merely, you will find many
who have bought for themselves maidens of an elegant form, and then, captivated
by love, have basely enslaved themselves to them. <i>Apame the concubine of King
Darius was once seen sitting at his right hand, taking his diadem off his head,
and placing it on her own, and with the palm of her left hand striking his face,
while the King gazed upon her with open mouth, glad if she would only smile upon
him, and thinking himself miserable and afflicted if she scorned him, laying
aside his authority, and seeking to soothe and persuade her to be reconciled to
him.</i></p>
<p>13.&nbsp; But why should I quote this at so great a length? <A NAME="p239"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|239</SPAN></A>
Do we not often see parents who have been made slaves by pirates or cruel
barbarians ransomed by their children? Are then the laws of mercy more powerful
than the laws of nature? Is natural affection produced in slavery? People often
buy lions and yet have no mastery over them, nay are so much their slaves that
if they see them becoming enraged and shaking out their manes on their brawny
necks, they run away and hide themselves. Money then determines nothing, for it
often buys masters over itself, nor do catalogues of auctions, for by them the
purchaser himself is often sold and allotted to another. A contract of sale does
not change a man's nature, nor deprive wisdom of her liberty. Many free men, as
it is written, serve a wise servant, and <i>there is a wise slave, who governs
foolish masters.</i></p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Whom then do you consider as more truly free? Wisdom alone is free,
she sets the poor over the rich, and makes the servants lend at usury to their
own masters; lend, that is, not money but understanding, lend the talent of that
Divine and eternal Treasure which is never wasted, the mere loan of which is
precious: to lend that mystical money of the heavenly oracles of which the Law
says, <i>Thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow. </i>This
the Jew lent to the Gentiles, for he received not instruction from them but
imparted it; to him the Lord opened His treasures, that He might moisten the
Gentiles with the dew of His Word, and might become the Head of the nations,
while He Himself had no head over Him.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; He then who is wise is free, bought with the price of the heavenly
oracles, with that gold, that silver of the Divine Word; bought with the price
of blood (for it is no small tiling to acknowledge one's Redeemer;) bought with
the price of Grace: he who heard and understood the words, <i>Ho every one that
thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and
drink and eat.</i></p>
<p>16.&nbsp; He is free who going forth to war, if he have seen a beautiful
woman, and when he spoils his enemies' goods has found her among them and <i>has
a desire unto her, takes her to wife, </i>having first <i>shaved her head and
pared her nails, </i><A NAME="p240"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|240</SPAN></A> <i>and taken off from her the raiment of her captivity, </i>taking her no
longer as a slave but free, for he understands that prudence and discipline are
not liable to a state of bondage. And therefore the Law says, <i>Thou shalt not
sell her at all for money, </i>for truly she is above all price. And Job says, <i>Take</i><sup><A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A></sup>
<i>wisdom into thine inmost parts. The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, </i>for
it is more precious than gold and silver.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Freedom therefore is not his alone who has never had the auctioneer
for his master, nor seen him raising his finger, but he is more truly free, who
is free within himself, who is free by the laws of nature, knowing that this law
has a moral not merely an arbitrary sanction, and that the measure of its
obligations is in accordance not with the will of man but with the discipline of
nature. Does such a person therefore seem to you free merely? Does he not rather
appear to you in the light of a censor and director of morals? Hence the
Scripture says truly that <i>the poor shall be set over the rich, and private
men over those who administer the state </i><sup><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A></sup>.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;Think you that he is free who buys votes with money, who courts the
applause of the people more than the approbation of the wise? Is he free who is
swayed by the popular breath, who dreads the hisses of the populace? That is not
liberty which he who is manumitted receives, which he obtains as a gift from the
blow of the lictor's palm. For it is not munificence but virtue that I hold to
constitute liberty; liberty, which is not bestowed by the suffrages of others,
but is won and possessed by a man's own greatness of mind. For a wise man is
always free, always honoured, always one who presides over the laws. <i>For the
law is not made for the righteous but for the unrighteous, </i>for the just man
is a law unto himself, having no need to fetch for himself from a distance the
form of virtue, seeing that he bears it within his heart, having <i>the works of
the law written on the tablets of his heart, </i>to whom it is said, <i>Drink
waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. </i>For
what is so near to <A NAME="p241"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|241</SPAN></A> us as the Word of God? This word is in our hearts, and in our mouth; we see
it not, and yet possess it.</p>
<p>19. The wise man therefore is free, for he who does that which he wills is
free. But it is not every will that is good, but it is the part of a wise man to
will all things which are good, for he hates what is evil, having chosen that
which is good. If therefore he has chosen what is good, he whose choice is free
and who has chosen what he will do is free, for he does what he wills to do: the
wise man therefore is free. All that the wise man does he does well. But he that
does all things well does all things rightly, and he that does all things
rightly does them all without offence or reproach, without causing disturbance
or loss to himself. Whoever then has this power of doing all things without
offence or reproach, without loss or disturbance to himself, does nothing
foolishly but does all things wisely. For he who acts wisely has nothing to
fear, for fear is in sin. But where no fear is, there is liberty, and where
liberty is, there is the power of doing what one wishes: the wise man therefore
alone is free.</p>
<p>20. He who can neither be compelled nor forbidden is no slave; now it belongs
to the wise man to be neither compelled nor forbidden; the wise man, therefore,
is not a slave. Now he is forbidden who does not execute what he desires, but
what does the wise man desire but the things which belong to virtue and
discipline, without which he cannot exist? For they subsist in him, and cannot
be separated from him. But if they are separated from him he is no longer wise,
seeing that he is without the use and discipline of virtue, of which he would
deprive himself if he were not the voluntary interpreter of virtue. But if he be
constrained, it is manifest that he acts unwillingly. Now in all actions there
are either corrections proceeding from virtue, or falls proceeding from malice,
or things between the two and indifferent. The wise man follows virtue not
compulsorily but voluntarily, for all things that are pleasing he does, as
flying from malice, and admits not so much as a dream of it. So far is he from
being moved by things indifferent, that no forces have the power to move him
hither and thither as they do the herd of men, <A NAME="p242"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|242</SPAN></A>
but his mind hangs as in a balance in equal scales, so that it neither
inclines to pleasure, nor in any respect directs its desires however slightly to
things which ought to be avoided, but remains unmoved in its affections. Whence
it appears that the wise man does nothing unwillingly or by compulsion, because
were he a slave he would be so compelled; the wise man therefore is free.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; The Apostle likewise gives this definition, saying, <i>Am I not an
Apostle, am I not free? </i>Truly he was so free that when certain persons had <i>come
in privily to spy out his liberty, </i>he <i>gave place, </i>as he himself says,
<i>by subjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the Gospel might be
preached. </i>He therefore who yielded not preached voluntarily. Where free will
is, there is the reward of free will; where obligation is, there is the service
of obligation. Free will therefore is better than obligation; to will is the
part of the wise man, to obey and to serve is the part of the fool.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; This is also the Apostle's definition, who says, <i>For if I do
this thing willingly, I have a reward : but if against my will a dispensation is
committed to me. </i>On the wise man therefore a reward is conferred, but the
wise man acts willingly, according to the Apostle therefore the wise man is
free. Wherefore he also exclaims, <i>Ye have been called unto liberty, only use
not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. </i>He separates the Christian from
the Law, that he may not seem to yield to the Law against his will; he calls him
to the Gospel, which the willing both preach and practise. The Jew is under the
Law, the Christian is by the Gospel; in the Law is bondage, in the Gospel, where
is the knowledge of wisdom, is liberty. Every one therefore who receives Christ
is wise, and he who is wise is free, every Christian therefore is both wise and
free.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; But the Apostle has taught me something even beyond freedom itself,
namely that to serve is real freedom, <i>Though I be free from all, </i>he says, <i>yet have I made myself
servant unto all, that I might gain the more. </i>What is that which surpasses
liberty but to have the Spirit of grace, to have charity? Liberty renders us
free to men, but charity genders us beloved by God. Wherefore Christ also says, <A NAME="p243"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|243</SPAN></A>
<i>But I have called you friends. </i>Good indeed is charity; whereof it is
said, <i>By love of the Spirit </i><A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> <i> serve one another.
</i>Christ
also became a servant that He might make all free. <i>His hands served in the
baskets: </i>He Who <i>thought it not robbery to be equal with God, took upon
Him the form of a servant, </i>and was made all things to all men, that He might
bring salvation to all. Following this example, Paul was both, as it were, under
the Law, and lived without the Law, for the benefit of those whom he desired to
gain: to the weak he voluntarily became weak that he might strengthen them; <i>he
ran so as to obtain, he kept under his body that he might be victorious over
heavenly powers in Christ.</i></p>
<p>24.&nbsp; To the wise man therefore even bondage is freedom; whence we may
gather that even to be in power is bondage to the fool, and what is worse, while
he rules over a few, he serves more and severer masters. For he serves his own
passions, his own lusts, their tyranny he can escape neither by night nor day,
for he carries these masters within his own breast, and suffers within himself
an intolerable bondage. For there is a double bondage, one of the body, another
of the soul; now the lords of the body are men, but the lords of the soul are
evil dispositions and passions, from which liberty of the mind alone frees the
wise man and enables him to depart from his bondage.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Let us seek therefore that truly wise man, that truly free man, who
although he live under the dominion of many, says freely, <i>Who is he that will
plead with me? from Whose sight I shall not be able to hide myself, only do Thou withdraw
Thy hand far from me, and let not Thy dread make me afraid.</i></p>
<p>26.&nbsp; And King David, who followed him, said, <i>Against Thee only have I
sinned. </i>For being supported by the royal dignity, and being, so to speak,
master of the laws, he was not subject to them but was liable to God alone, Who
is the Lord of hosts.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp;Hear another free man; <i>But with me it is a very small thing that
I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment : yea, I judge not mine own
self, </i>for I know nothing <i>against </i>myself, .... <i>but He that judgeth
me is the Lord. </i><A NAME="p244"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|244</SPAN></A> <i> </i>The freedom of the spiritual man is a true freedom, because <i>he judgeth all
things, yet he himself is judged of no man, </i>because he knows himself to be
subject to nothing which has any participation in the creature, but to God
alone, Who only is without sin, of Whom Job also says, <i>God liveth Who hath
taken away my judgment, </i>for the just man can only be judged by Him <i>in
Whose sight the heavens are not clean, nor the light of the stars pure and
clean.</i></p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Will any one bring forward those verses of Sophocles which say
'Jupiter, and no mortal man is ruler over me?' How much more ancient is Job, how
much older is David? Let them acknowledge then that they have borrowed from us
the more excellent of their sayings.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Who then is wise but he who has arrived at the very mysteries of
the Godhead, and has known the hidden things of wisdom to be manifested to him.
He then alone is wise who has taken God as his guide, to conduct him to the
secret resting-place of truth, and although but a mortal man has become by grace
the heir and successor of the eternal God, and partaker, as it were, of His
sweetness, as it is written, <i>Wherefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</i></p>
<p>30.&nbsp; Now if any man will examine more closely these matters, he will
perceive what great assistance the wise man finds and what great obstacles the
foolish, in the very same things; that to the one freedom is an aid, to the
other bondage is an impediment. For the wise man rises as a conqueror, having
vanquished and triumphed over lust, fear, sloth, sadness and other vices. This
he does until he casts them out from the possession of his mind, driving and
excluding them from all its bounds and limits, for as a cautious general he
knows how to guard against the incursions of robbers, and those hostile
stratagems which the wicked enemies of our soul are frequently attempting with
their fiery darts; for we have both wars in peace and peace in war. Whence also
he says, <i>Without were fightings, within were fears. </i>But <i>in all these
things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. </i>He says this
because he was terrified neither by straits nor persecutions, nor hunger, nor
danger, nor death. <A NAME="p245"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|245</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; But he who fears these things, who dreads death, how is he not a
slave? Truly he is a slave, and that in a miserable bondage; for nothing so
subjects the mind to all kind of bondage as the fear of death. For how can the
abject and vile and ignoble sense raise itself up, when it is deeply sunk in the
pit of corruption, through the lusts of this life. Behold, how much he is a
slave: <i>I shall be hid, </i>he says, <i>and I shall be a fugitive and a
vagabond in the earth, and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me
shall slay me. </i>Therefore as a slave he received a sign, but even thus he
could not escape death. Thus the sinner is a slave to fear, to cupidity, to
avarice, to lust, to malice, to anger, nay, he is a greater slave than if he
were set under tyrants.</p>
<p>32.&nbsp; But they are free who live by the laws. Now true law is right
reason, true law not sculptured on tablets, nor engraved in brass, but impressed
on the mind, and fixed in the senses; for the wise man is not under the law, but
is a law unto himself, bearing the work of the Law in his heart, inscribed and
formed therein by a kind of pen natural to himself. Are we then so blind as not
to see the manifest characters of things, and the images of virtues? And how
unworthy is it that whole nations should obey human laws, that they may become
thereby partakers of liberty : but that wise men should neglect and abandon the
true law of nature formed according to the image of God, and true reason, the
sign-bearer of liberty; since there is so much liberty therein, that when
children we are unconscious of any bondage to vice, being removed from anger,
free from avarice, ignorant of lust. How miserable therefore, that we who are
born in liberty should die in bondage!</p>
<p>33.&nbsp; But this arises from the levity of our mind and the infirmity of
our character; because we are occupied by idle cares, and superfluous actions:
but the heart of the wise man, his works and deeds, ought to be stedfast and
immoveable. Moses taught us this, when his hands became heavy, so that Joshua
the son of Nun could scarcely hold them up. And therefore the people were
victorious when works not of a perfunctory kind, but full of gravity and virtue
were being carried on, not the works of a mind <A NAME="p246"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|246</SPAN></A>
unsteady, and staggering to and fro in its affections, but of one firmly rooted
and established. The wise man therefore stretches out his hands, but the fool
draws them together, as it is written, <i>The fool foldeth his hands together,
and eateth his own flesh</i>, meditating on carnal more than spiritual things.
But not so did that daughter of Juda, who stretched forth her hands and cried to
the Lord, <i>Thou knowest thai they have borne false witness against me. </i>She
thought it better not to sin and to incur the calumnies of her accusers, than to
commit sin under the veil of impunity. And by the contempt of death she
preserved her innocence. Not so, either, the daughter of Jepthah, who by her own
consent confirmed and even encouraged her father's vow concerning her own
immolation.</p>
<p>34.&nbsp; For I will not produce the books of philosophers on the contempt of
death, or the gymnosophists of the Indians, of whom the answer of Calanus <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
to Alexander, when he commanded him to follow him, is especially commended. 'To
what praise' said he 'do you consider me entitled, that you require me to travel
to Greece, if I can be compelled to do that to which my will consents not?' A
reply truly full of dignity, and yet his mind was more full of liberty. He wrote
this letter also.</p>
<p align="center">CALANUS TO ALEXANDER.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>35.&nbsp; &quot;Your friends persuade you to lay hands and even constraint on
the Indian philosophers, not even in their dreams beholding our works. Our
bodies you may remove from place to place, our souls you cannot compel to do
what they do not will, no more than wood or stone to utter sounds. A great fire
burns pain into living bodies and begets corruption; on this fire we are, for we
are burning alive. There is neither king nor prince who can compel us to do what
we have not determined to do. Nor are we like the philosophers of Greece, who
have conceived words rather than realities, in order to give celebrity to their
opinions; in our case realities are associated with words and words with
realities; our acts are swift and our discourses short, we enjoy a delightful
freedom in the exercise of virtue.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>36 and 37. Excellent words, but still words; excellent constancy, but that of
a man; excellent letter, but that of <A NAME="p247"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|247</SPAN></A>
a philosopher. But amongst us, even maidens through desire of death have
mounted even up to heaven by the lofty steps of virtue. Why should I mention
Thecla, Agnes, or Pelagia, who sprouting forth as noble tendrils <sup><i><A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
</i></sup>have
hastened to death as if to immortality? The virgin exulted among lions, and
dauntlessly beheld the roaring beasts. And to compare our history with that of
the Indian philosophers, what Calanus boasted in words holy Laurence proved by
his acts, for he was burnt alive, and surviving the flames said, 'Turn me and
eat me.' Nor did the youths of the race of Abraham<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> or the sons of
the Maccabees strive less boldly; the former sung while in the midst of the
flames, and the latter, during their punishment, asked not to be spared, but
reproached their persecutor in order to enrage him more. The wise man therefore
is free.</p>
<p>38.&nbsp; But what can be more sublime than holy Pelagia, who was surrounded
by persecutors, but before she came into their presence said; 'I die willingly,
no man shall touch me, no one with wanton look shall defile my chastity, I will
carry away with me my modesty, my honour untainted; these ruffians shall reap no
profit from their insolence. Pelagia will follow Christ, no man shall deprive
her of her liberty, no man shall see her free faith made captive, her
illustrious chastity, her inheritance of wisdom. What is enslaved shall remain
here, not amenable to any duty.' Great therefore is the freedom of that pious
virgin, who encircled by her persecutors gave way not the least in the midst of
these great dangers to her integrity and her life.</p>
<p>39.&nbsp; But he is not free over whom anger reigns, for he is subject to the
yoke of sin; for <i>an angry man diggeth out sin, </i>and, <i>Whosoever
committeth sin, is the servant of sin. </i>Neither is he free who is enslaved to
avarice, for he cannot possess his vessel. Neither is he free who seeing his
desires and pleasures, fluctuates in his devious course. He is not free who is
bowed down by ambition, for he obeys the rule of another. But he is free who is
able to say, <i>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient,
all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
Meals for the belly, and the belly for </i><A NAME="p248"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|248</SPAN></A>
<i>meats. </i>He is free who says, <i>For why is my liberty judged of another
man's conscience?</i></p>
<p>40.&nbsp; Liberty therefore belongs to the wise man not to the fool; for <i>he
who binds a stone in a sling is like him who giveth honour to a fool, </i>for he
wounds himself, and while brandishing his dart chiefly endangers his own body.
Certainly as he is stung by the sling, and by the falling of the stone the evil
is increased, so the fall of a fool when he is set at liberty is more rapid.
Wherefore the power of a fool is rather to be retrenched than any new liberty
added, for slavery is suitable for him. And therefore it is added, <i>As a thorn
goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. </i>For
as he is wounded by his cups, so is the fool by his deeds. The one by drinking
involves himself in sin, the other by acting subjects himself to censure, and by
his deeds is drawn into bondage. Paul saw himself <i>brought into captivity by
the taw of sin, </i>and therefore, in order to be freed, he fled to the grace of
liberty.</p>
<p>41.&nbsp; Fools then are not free, for it is said to them, <i>Be ye not like
to horse and mule, which have no understanding, whose mouths must be held with
bit and bridle lest they fall upon thee. Great plagues remain for the ungodly; </i>for
they have need of these, in order that their folly may be restrained. It is good
discipline which requires this, not severity. Further, <i>he that spareth his
rod hateth his son: </i>for a man's own sins scourge him still more severely.
For heavy is the weight of crime, heavy the scourges of sin; they are heavy as a
sore burthen, they inflict wounds upon the soul, and make the ulcers of the mind
to stink.</p>
<p>42.&nbsp; Wherefore let us lay aside this grievous burthen of slavery, let us
renounce sensuality, and the evil delights which bind us with the bonds, as it
were, of lusts, and fetter us with chains. For these delights profit not the
fool, and whoever has given himself to them from his boyhood will abide in
bondage; living he will be as dead. Let sensuality then be cut down, let evil
delights be pruned away, and let him who has been wanton bid farewell to his
former courses. For the vine which has been cut down bears fruit, that which has
been partly pruned puts forth leaves, <A NAME="p249"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|249</SPAN></A>
that which has been neglected grows too luxuriantly. Therefore it is written,
<i>Like a field is the foolish man, and like a vineyard the man void of
understanding; </i>if you leave him alone, he will become desolate. Let us then
tend this body of ours, let us chasten it, let us reduce it to subjection, let
us not neglect it.</p>
<p>43.&nbsp; For our members are <i>instruments of righteousness, </i>they are
also <i>instruments of sin. </i>If they are raised upwards, they are instruments
of righteousness, that sin should not reign in them: if our body has died to
sin, transgression will not reign therein, and our members will be free from
sin. Let us not therefore obey its lusts, nor <i>yield our members instruments
of unrighteousness unto sin. </i>If you have looked upon a woman to lust after
her, your members are the instruments of sin. If you have spoken and solicited
her, your tongue and your mouth are instruments of sin. If you have removed the
landmarks which your fathers set up, your members are instruments of sin. If you
have hasted <i>with swift feet to shed the blood </i>of the innocent, your
members ars instruments of sin.</p>
<p>44.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you have seen a poor man, and taken him into
your house, your members are instruments of righteousness. If you have rescued
one who was suffering wrong, or one who was being led to execution; if you have
cancelled the bond of the debtor, your members are instruments of righteousness.
If you have confessed Christ (for <i>the lips of knowledge are the instruments
of understanding,</i>)<i> </i>your lips are the members of righteousness. He who
can say, <i>I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame, I was a father
to the poor, </i>his members are members of righteousness.</p>
<p>45.&nbsp; Being therefore set free from sin, and redeemed, as it were, at the
price of the Blood of Christ, let us not be made subject to the bondage of men
or of passion. Let us not blush to confess our sins. Behold how free he was who
could say, <i>I</i> <i>feared not the multitude of the people; that I should not
confess my sin in the sight of all. </i>For he that confesses his sin is
released from servitude, and <i>the just accuses himself in the beginning of his speech.
</i>Not only the free
but the just man also; but justice is in liberty <A NAME="p250"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|250</SPAN></A>
and liberty in confession, for as soon as a man shall confess he is absolved.
Lastly, <i>I</i> <i>said I will confess my sins unto the Lord, and so Thou
forgavest the wickedness of my sin. </i>The delay of absolution depends on
confessing, the remission of sins follows closely on confession. He therefore is
wise who confesses; he is free whose sin is remitted, for he contracts now no
debt of guilt. Farewell: love me as indeed you do, for I also love you.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p><b><a name="letter38"></a>LETTER XXXVIII.&nbsp; </b>[A.D.387.]</p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="small">In this Letter S. Ambrose continues the subject, maintaining that the truly
wise man is not only free but rich also, illustrating his statements with
instances from the Old Testament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO SIMPLICIAN, GREETING.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When we lately pointed out, taking our theme from the epistle of the
Apostle Paul, that every wise man is free, we seemed to have fallen into
philosophical discussion. But afterwards, in reading the epistle of the Apostle
Peter, I perceived that every wise man is also rich: and this he says without
distinction of sex, for he writes that all a woman's ornaments consist in a
virtuous life, not in costly jewels, <i>Whose adorning, </i>he says, <i>is not
that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and, of wearing of gold, or of
putting on of apparel, but the hidden man of the heart.</i></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Here then are two things, both that there is a man within the man,
and that he is rich who seeks not for himself the enjoyment of any riches. And
he has well said, <i>the man of the heart, </i>in that the whole man of wisdom
is hidden, as is wisdom itself, which is not seen but understood. No one before
Peter used such an expression as, <i>the man of the heart; </i>for the outward
man consists of many members, but the inward man of the heart is entirely full
of wisdom, full of grace, full of beauty. <A NAME="p251"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|251</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>In that, </i>he says, <i>which is not corruptible, even the
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price. </i>And he is truly rich, who can appear rich in the sight of God, in
whose sight the earth is small, the world itself is narrow, but God considers
him only to be rich who is rich for eternity, who lays up the fruit not of
riches, but of virtues. And who is rich before God but that meek and quiet
spirit which is never corrupted? Does not he appear to you to be rich, who
possesses peace of mind and the tranquillity of rest? who desires nothing, is
not tossed by the storms of lust;, despises not old things, seeks not new, so as
by his constant desire to become poor in the midst of riches?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;That peace is truly rich, which <i>passeth all understanding. </i>Peace
is rich, modesty is rich, faith is rich, for <i>to the faithful the whole world is a possession.
</i>Simplicity is rich, for
there are also the riches of simplicity; for she scrutinizes nothing, has no
mean, no suspicious, no deceitful thoughts, but pours herself forth with pure
affection.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Goodness too is rich, and if a man preserve it he is fed by the
riches of the heavenly inheritance. To quote also the more ancient examples of
Scripture, <i>Happy, </i>it is said, <i>is the man whom God correcteth. </i>Therefore
<i>despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty </i>.... <i>in famine He
shall redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword. Thou shalt
be hid from the scourge of the tongue; </i>.... <i>the beasts of the field shall
be at peace with thee, and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in
peace. </i>For the vices of this flesh being subdued, and those passions which
are wont to war against the soul, your tabernacle shall be undisturbed, your
house without offence, your seed shall not fail, your posterity shall be as the
smell of a fruitful field, your burial as the harvest. For while others are
looking for theirs to fail, the heap of your corn will be carried ripe into the
heavenly garners.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Fit it is that the righteous ever lendeth, while the wicked man is
in want. He lendeth justice, he lendeth the commandments of God to the poor and
needy; but the fool does not possess even that which he believes himself to
possess. Do you suppose that he can be said to possess, <A NAME="p252"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|252</SPAN></A>
who brooding over his treasure night and day, is troubled by covetous and
wretched anxiety? Such a one truly wants; although to others he appears rich, to
himself he is poor, because he who is still grasping after more and desiring
more uses not that which he possesses. For where there are no bounds to desire,
what profit can there be in riches? No man is rich who cannot carry away with
him that which he has, for that which is left behind, is not our own but
another's.</p>
<p>7. Enoch was rich who carried away with him that which he had, and laid up
all the riches of his goodness in the heavenly treasure-house; he was <i>taken
away lest that wickedness should alter his understanding. </i>Elias was rich,
who riding in a chariot of fire carried the treasures of his virtues up to the
heavenly mansions. Not small were the riches he left to his heir, and yet he
himself did not lose them. Who would have called him poor even then, when being
himself in need of the sustenance of daily food, he was sent to the widow that
he might be nourished by her, when at his voice the heaven was shut and opened,
when at his word the barrel of meal and the cruse of oil failed not for three
years, but overflowed; when it was replenished not diminished by use? Who would
call him poor at whose word there came fire down from heaven, whom the river
impassible by others could not retard, retiring back to its source that the
prophet might pass over dry-shod?</p>
<p>8. Ancient history tells us of two neighbours, king Ahab and the poor Naboth;
which of these do we believe to be the richer, which the poorer? The one,
endowed with the royal support of riches, insatiable and not to be replenished
with wealth, coveted the little vineyard of the poor man; the other, despising
in his mind the golden fortunes of kings, and imperial treasures, was content
with his own vines. Does not he appear richer and more kingly, who was
sufficient to himself, and controlled his own desires, coveting nothing that
belonged to another? Does not he, on the other hand, appear most needy, in whose
eyes his own gold was accounted vile, and another man's vine precious. But learn
for what reason he was most needy: <A NAME="p253"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|253</SPAN></A>
because <i>riches unjustly gotten are vomited up again, </i>but <i>the root
of the righteous yieldeth fruit, and flourishes like a palm-tree.</i></p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Is not he more needy than the poor man, who pass-eth away like a
shadow? To-day the ungodly is in great power, to-morrow he is not, and his place
can no more be found. But what is it to be rich, unless it be to abound? But who
abounds whose mind is contracted, and therefore straightened, and what abundance
can there be in straits? He therefore is not rich who does not abound. Wherefore
David says well, <i>The rich lack and suffer hunger</i>; for although they
possessed the treasures of the Divine Scriptures, they still lacked in that they
did not understand, and hungered in that they tasted not the food of spiritual
grace.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Nothing can therefore be richer than the temper of the wise man,
nothing poorer than that of the fool. For since the kingdom of God belongs to
the poor, what can be richer? And therefore the Apostle says well, <i>O the
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! </i>Well also
David, who <i>had as great delight in the way of the heavenly testimonies as in
all manner of riches. </i>And Moses says expressly, <i>Naphtali, satisfied with
favour. </i>Now Naphtali means when translated, 'abundance' or 'increase.' So
that to be satisfied and to abound go together, but where there is the hunger of
desire and insatiable lust, there truly is poverty. But since scarcely any
desire of money or of this world can be satisfied, it is added, <i>full with
blessing.</i></p>
<p>11.&nbsp; It is in accordance with these principles that the Apostle Peter
has declared that the ornament of women consists not in gold and silver and
apparel, but in the secret and hidden man of the heart. Wherefore let no woman
put off the dress of piety, the ornament of grace, the inheritance of eternal
life.</p>
<p>Farewell: love me, for I love you. <A NAME="p254"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|254</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

  </blockquote>
<p class="small">S. Ambrose in this Letter seeks to rouse Faustinus from excessive grief for
his sister's death, first on the ground of duty towards the children left to his
care and protection, and then on the higher ground of submission to the Divine
will, and realization of Christian hopes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">AMBROSE TO FAUSTINUS, GREETING.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I was well aware that you would grieve with bitter grief for the
death of your sister: still you should not go into banishment, but rather give
yourself back to us, for although mourners are little inclined to receive
consolation, it is sometimes necessary for them. But you have fled to the
recesses of the mountains, and made your dwelling in the caves of wild beasts,
laying aside all customary human converse and, what is worse, the use of your
own reason.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Is it in accordance with your esteem for your sister, that human
nature, which ought to be much regarded by you for producing a woman so
excellent, should on her account be of less value in your eyes? In quitting this
life it doubtless was a consolation to her to believe that she left you behind
her as a parent to your nephews, a guardian of their tender years, a succour to
their destitution; but you so utterly withhold yourself both from your nephews
and from us, that we do not reap any benefit from what she thus found a ground
of consolation. These dear pledges invite you not to grieve, but to comfort
them, that in seeing you they may believe their mother to be still alive. In you
then let them recognize her, in you let them enjoy her presence, in you think
that she still survives to them.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But you grieve that she has been lately cut off in the flower of her
age. This however is the common fate not only of men, but of states and
countries themselves. Coming from Bononia <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> you left behind you
Claterna, Bononia <A NAME="p255"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|255</SPAN></A> itself, Matina, Rhegium; Brixillum was on your right, in front of you
Placentia, by its very name still recalling its ancient lustre, on the left you
saw with pity the wastes of the Apennines, you surveyed the fortresses of these
once flourishing tribes, and remembered them with sorrowful affection. Do not
then the carcases of so many half-ruined cities, and states stretched on their
bier beneath your eyes, do not these remind you that the decease of one woman,
holy and excellent as she was, is much less deplorable, especially as these are
for ever laid prostrate and destroyed, but she though removed from us for a
while is passing a more blessed life elsewhere?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Wherefore I deem that you ought not so much to deplore her, as to
offer for her your prayers; make her not sorrowful by your tears, rather commend
her soul to God by oblations.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Perhaps however you will declare yourself to be secure of her merits
and faith, you cannot endure the feeling of regret at seeing her no longer after
the flesh, which is to you a better grief. And does not the Apostolic saying
move you that <i>henceforth we know no man after the flesh; yea, though we have
known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more. </i>For
our flesh cannot be perpetual and lasting, it must needs die that it may rise
again, it must be dissolved that it may rest, and sin come to an end. We too
have known many according to the flesh, but now we know them no more. <i>We have
known the Lord Jesus, </i>says the Apostle, <i>after the flesh, yet now
henceforth know we Him no more. </i>For now He has put off the coil of the body,
and is not seen in fashion as a Man, but has died for all and all are dead in
Him, to the intent that being renewed by Him and quickened in the Spirit they
may no longer live to themselves but to Christ. Wherefore the same Apostle also
says elsewhere, <i>I</i> <i>live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</i></p>
<p>6. And well indeed was it that he who had before known Christ after the
flesh, who had before persecuted and oppressed with bitter hatred the disciples
of the Man, and the attendants on His bodily presence, but who now recognized
His invisible workings, discerning not His bodily presence <A NAME="p256"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|256</SPAN></A>
but His power,----well indeed was it that he became the teacher of the
Gentiles, and began to instruct and prepare the worshippers of His Divinity to
become preachers of the Gospel. Wherefore he added, <i>if any man be in Christ,
he is a new creature, </i>that is, he that is perfect in Christ is a new
creature, for all flesh is imperfect. And the Lord saith, <i>My spirit shall not
always strive with man, for that he also is flesh. </i>No carnal man then is in
Christ, but <i>if any man be in Christ he is a new creature, </i>formed by
newness not of nature but of grace. These <i>old things </i>which are according
to the flesh <i>have past away, all things are made new. </i>And what are they
but the things which <i>the scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven </i>knows,
<i>like unto that householder, who brings forth out of his treasure things new
and old; </i>neither old things without new, nor new things without old? Thus
too the Church saith, <i>things new and old have I laid up for Thee. </i>For old
things, that is, the hidden mysteries of the Law are passed away, all things are
made new in Christ.</p>
<p>7. This is the new creature of which the Apostle writing to the Galatians
saith, <i>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature, </i>already our flesh now renewed
flourishes, and having before borne the thorns of inveterate sin hath now found
the fruit of grace. Why then need we grieve, if we can now say to the soul, <i>thy
youth is renewed like the eagles? </i>And why should we bewail the dead, now
that by our Lord Jesus <i>the world has been reconciled to the Father? </i>Since
then we hold the benefits which Christ hath given, we are to you as well as to
all ambassadors in Christ's stead, that you may know His Gift to be irrevocable,
that you may believe what you always have believed, and not bring your opinion
into discredit by too much sorrow. For the Lord Jesus was made sin that He might
<i>take away the sin of the world, </i>and we all might be <i>made the
righteousness of God in Him; </i>now no longer subject to the penalty of sin,
but sure of the reward of righteousness.</p>
<p>Farewell; love me, for I love you. <A NAME="p257"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|257</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

  </blockquote>
<p class="small">In the year 388 A.D. the synagogue of the Jews at Callinicum in Mesopotamia
was burnt by the Christians, at the instance, it was asserted, of the Bishop.
Some monks also in the same district, having been insulted by some Valentinian
heretics, while singing Psalms in processsion on the Festival of the Maccabees,
(Aug. 1st.) had burnt their conventicle. Theodosius had ordered that the Bishop
should re-build the synagogue at his own cost, and that the monks should be
punished, and the whole matter carefully sifted, and justice done. This Letter
is written by S. Ambrose to remonstrate. He urges his plea with the boldest
importunity, and, as he tells his sister in the following letter, Theodosius
eventually yielded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">TO THE MOST GRACIOUS PRINCE AND BLESSED EMPEROR HIS MAJESTY THEODOSIUS, BISHOP
AMBROSE SENDS GREETING.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Nearly incessant are the cares which harass me, most excellent
Emperor, but never was I in such trouble as at present; for I see I must be on
my guard against the danger even of a charge of sacrilege. Wherefore I beseech
you patiently to hear my address. For if I am unworthy to be heard by you, I am
unworthy to offer for you, or to have your vows and prayers intrusted to me.
Will you not hear him whom you wish to be heard in your behalf? Will you not
hear him pleading for himself whom you have heard when pleading for others? Will
you not dread the consequences of your own judgment; and fear to render him
unworthy to be heard in your behalf, by treating him as unworthy of a hearing
from you.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it is neither the part of an Emperor to deny liberty of
speech, nor of a Bishop not to utter what he thinks. There is no quality more
amiable and popular in an Emperor than to cherish freedom even in those who owe
him military allegiance. For there is this difference between good and bad
rulers, that the good love freedom, the bad slavery. And there is nothing in a
Bishop so offensive in God's sight, or so base before men, as not freely to
declare his opinions. For it is written, <i>I spake of Thy testimonies also even
before kings, and was not ashamed, </i>and in another place, <i>Son of man, I
have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; with the intent, </i>it
proceeds, <A NAME="p258"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|258</SPAN></A> <i>that if the righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit
iniquity, because thou hast not given him warning </i><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
that
is, hast not told him what to beware of, <i>his righteousness which he hath done
shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he
doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou shalt
deliver thy soul,</i></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I prefer then, to have fellowship with your Majesty in good rather
than in evil; and therefore the silence of a Bishop ought to be displeasing to
your Clemency, and his freedom pleasing. For you will be implicated in the
danger of my silence, you will share in the benefits of my outspokenness. I am
not then an officious meddler in matters beyond my province, an intruder in the
concerns of others, but I comply with my duty, I obey the commandment of our
God. This I do chiefly from love and regard to you, and from a wish to preserve
your well-being. But if I am not believed, or am forbidden to act on this
motive, then in truth I speak from fear of offending God. For if my own danger
could deliver you, I would consent to be offered for you, though not willingly,
for I would rather that without danger to myself you should be accepted and
glorified by God. But if I am to suffer under the charge of silence and
dissimulation without effecting your exculpation I had rather you should deem me
too importunate than useless or mercenary. For it is written, in the words of
the holy Apostle Paul, whose teaching you cannot gainsay, <i>Be instant in
season, out of season: reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and
doctrine.</i></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; We then also have One Whom it is even more dangerous to displease;
especially as even Emperors themselves are not offended with any man for
fulfilling his function, but you patiently give ear to every one speaking
concerning his own department, nay you reprove him for not acting in accordance
with his line of duty. Can that then which you readily accept from your
soldiers, seem to you offensive in a Bishop; seeing that we speak not according
to our own wills, but as we are commanded? For you know that it is written, <i>when
ye shall be brought before </i><A NAME="p259"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|259</SPAN></A> <i>governors and kings take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it
shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that
speak, but the Spirit of your Father Which speaketh in you. </i>Were it in civil
causes that I had to speak, my not obtaining an audience would not give me such
apprehension, although even then justice ought to be observed, but in God's
cause whom will you hear, if you hear not the Bishop, at whose great peril it is
that sin is committed? Who will dare to tell you the truth, if a Bishop does
not?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I know that you are pious, merciful, meek and gentle, having at
heart the faith and fear of the Lord; but some failings oftentimes escape our
notice. Some men <i>have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, </i>and
we ought, I think, to beware lest this steal even over faithful souls. I know
your piety towards God, your lenity towards men; I am myself indebted to your
courtesy for many benefits. Wherefore I feel greater fear, and deeper solicitude
lest even your own judgment should hereafter condemn me for having failed,
through cowardice or flattery, in saving you from a fall. If I had seen you sin
against myself, I ought not to have kept silence, for it is written, <i>If thy
brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault; then rebuke him
before two or three witnesses, and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it
unto the Church. </i>Shall I then be silent in the cause of God? Now then let us
consider what it is I have to apprehend.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The military Count of the East <A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> reported that a
synagogue had been burnt, and that this had been done at the instigation of the
Bishop. You decided that the others should be punished, and that the synagogue
should be rebuilt by the Bishop himself. I will not insist on the propriety of
calling for the Bishop's own statement; for the clergy are wont to check
disturbances and desirous of peace, <A NAME="p260"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|260</SPAN></A>
save when they are themselves moved by some offence against God or insult to
the Church. But suppose this Bishop to have been too eager in setting fire to
this synagogue, and now to grow timid before the judgment-seat, has your Majesty
no fear, lest he should acquiesce in your sentence, no apprehension of his
becoming apostate?</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Do you not fear, what will certainly be the case, that he will meet
your officer with a refusal; and so he will be obliged to make him either an
apostate or a martyr, and both of these are adverse to your interests and savour
of persecution, that he should be forced either to become an apostate or undergo
martyrdom. You see then whereunto this matter tends; if you think the Bishop
firm, avoid driving his firmness to martyrdom; if you think him frail, shun
exposing his frailty to a fall. For a heavy responsibility lies on him who has
caused one who is weak to fall.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Under these circumstances I suppose that the Bishop will say that he
himself kindled the fire, gathered the crowd, collected the people; so as not to
lose an opportunity of martyrdom, and in place of the weak to offer up a bolder
victim. O happy falsehood; obtaining for others acquittal, for himself Grace.
This is my request also to your Majesty, that you would turn your vengeance upon
me, and, if you consider this a crime, impute it to me. Why do you order the
absent to be punished? you have the guilty person before you, you hear his
confession, I openly affirm that I myself set the synagogue on fire, or at
least, that I ordered others to do so; that there might be no place in which
Christ is denied. And if it be objected, why did I not set it on fire in this
very city? It began to be burnt, I reply, by the Divine judgment, my work was
superseded. And to speak the truth, I was the less zealous because I expected no
punishment. Why should I do that which being unavenged would also be unrewarded?
These words are a shock to modesty, but they also bring back grace; they provide
against the commission of that which may offend Almighty God.</p>
<p>9. But suppose that no one will cite the Bishop to do this; for this is what
I have begged of your Clemency, and <A NAME="p261"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|261</SPAN></A>
though I have not yet read that the edict is revoked, I will nevertheless
assume it to be so. But what if other more timid persons, from a fear of death
offer to rebuild the synagogue from their own funds, or the Count, finding this
previously ordained, should himself command it to be restored at the expense of
the Christians? Your Majesty will then have an apostate Count, and you will
entrust your victorious banner, your labarum, which is consecrated by the name
of Christ, to one who is the restorer of the synagogue which knows not Christ.
Command the labarum to be carried into the synagogue, and let us see if they do
not resist.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Shall then a building be raised for perfidious Jews out of the
spoils of the Church, and shall that patrimony, which by Christ's mercy has been
assigned to Christians, be transferred to the temples of the unbelieving? We
read that temples were in former days erected from the spoils of the Cimbri and
other enemies of Rome. Shall the Jews inscribe this title on the front of their
synagogue: 'The temples of impiety built from the spoils of Christians?'</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; But the maintenance of discipline is perhaps what influences your
Majesty. Is the show of discipline then weightier than the cause of religion?
Police should give place to religion.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Has your Majesty never heard that when Julian commanded the temple
at Jerusalem to be restored, they who cleared away the rubbish were destroyed by
fire from heaven? Are you not afraid lest this should now happen? Surely you
ought not to have commanded what Julian commanded.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; But why are you thus moved? Is it generally because a public
building has been burnt, or because it is a synagogue? If you are moved by the
conflagration of the meanest edifice, (and what else could there have been in so
obscure a town,) does not your Majesty remember how many prefects' houses have
been burnt at Rome, and yet no man enacted vengeance for them? Nay, if any
Emperor had desired to punish such an act severely, he would rather have injured
the cause of those who had suffered so great a loss. Which then is the more
fitting, that the partial <A NAME="p262"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|262</SPAN></A> burning of some houses at Callinicum
<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>, or the burning of the city
of Rome should be punished, if indeed either of them ought to have been so. At
Constantinople, a while ago, the Bishop's <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> house was burnt, and your
Majesty's son interceded with you, that you would not avenge the wrong done to
him, the youthful Emperor, nor the burning of the Bishop's palace. Your Majesty
should consider, that, if you should in like manner command this act to be
punished, he may again intercede to prevent it. The former boon however was
happily obtained from the father by the son, for it was only fitting that he
should first remit the injury to himself. A good distribution of favour and well
allotted it is, that the son should be petitioned for his own loss, and the
father for the offence against his son. In this case there is nothing which you
need keep back on your son's account, beware also lest you derogate ought from
God.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; There is then no adequate reason for any such commotion, that the
people should be so severely punished for the burning of any building; much less
seeing that it is a synagogue that has been burnt, a place of unbelief, a house
of impiety, a receptacle of madness, which God Himself hath condemned. For thus
we read what the Lord our God spake by the mouth of Jeremiah, <i>Therefore will
I do unto this house, which is called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and unto the
place which I gave to you, and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. And I
wilt cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the
whole seed of Ephraim. Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up
cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to Me, for I will not hear
thee. Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah? </i>God forbids him to
intercede for those whom you think worthy of being avenged.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; Were I pleading according to the law of nations, I should assuredly
recount how many Churches the Jews burnt in the time of Julian's reign: two at
Damascus, one <A NAME="p263"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|263</SPAN></A> of which is but just repaired, and that at the expense, not of the synagogue,
but of the Church, while the other is still a mass of shapeless ruins. Churches
were likewise burnt at Gaza, Ascalon, Berytus, and nearly every town in that
region, and yet no man asked for vengeance. At Alexandria too the most beautiful
Church of all was burnt down by the Gentiles and Jews. The Church has not been
avenged, shall then the synagogue be?</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; And shall the burning of the temple of the Valentinians likewise be
punished? For what but a temple is the place where Gentiles assemble? The
Gentiles indeed reckon twelve gods, the Valentinians worship thirty two Aeons <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>,
whom they call gods. Concerning these I am informed that they have called for
punishment upon some monks. For the Valentinians having endeavoured to stop them
as they were going in procession according to ancient custom, chanting psalms,
to celebrate the festival of the Maccabees, the monks exasperated by this
affront, set fire to one of their rudely constructed temples in some country
village.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; How many have to offer themselves to this choice, remembering that
in Julian's time he who threw down the altar and disturbed the sacrifice was
condemned by the judge, and suffered martyrdom. And accordingly the judge who
tried him was never considered other than a persecutor, no man would associate
with him, no man deemed him worthy of a kiss of greeting. Were he not now dead,
I should fear your Majesty's taking vengeance upon him. Nevertheless he escaped
not the Divine vengeance, but saw his son die before him.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; But it is reported that the judge was ordered to take cognizance of
the matter, and was informed that he ought not to have reported upon it, but to
have punished it, that the offerings which had been taken away were to be
demanded back. Other particulars 1 will omit; but when the Jews burnt our
Churches, nothing was restored, nothing demanded, nothing sought for. But what
could the synagogue possess in that distant place, when everything in it was but
of little value, nothing precious or abundant. <A NAME="p264"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|264</SPAN></A>
In short of what could a fire deprive the treacherous Jews? These are devices
of the Jews who wish to accuse us falsely, that through their representations an
extraordinary military tribunal may be appointed, and an officer sent, who
perhaps will say what one said here before your accession, 'How shall Christ
help us, when we fight for the Jews against Christ? when we are sent to take
vengeance on their behalf? They have lost their own armies, and they wish to
destroy ours.'</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Nay, what are the calumnies into which they will not rush, who by
false witnesses have slandered Christ Himself? who are false even in matters
relating to God? Whom will they not charge with the guilt of this sedition? whom
will they not thirst after, even though they know them not? They desire to see
rank after rank of Christians in chains, to see the necks of the faithful placed
under the yoke, the servants of God hidden in darkness, smitten with the axe,
delivered to the fire, or sent to the mines, that their pains may be slow and
lingering.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; Will your Majesty give this triumph to the Jews over the Church of
God? this victory over the people of Christ, this joy to the unbelievers, this
felicity to the Synagogue, this grief to the Church? They will place this
solemnity among their feast-days; numbering it among those wherein they
triumphed over the Ammonites, or Canaanites, or over Pharaoh king of Egypt, or
which delivered them from the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. This
festival they will add in memory of the triumph they have gained over Christ's
people.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Although they refuse to be bound by Roman laws, deeming them even
criminal, they now pretend to claim vengeance according to those laws. Where
were those laws, when they burnt the roofs of the consecrated Basilicas? If
Julian avenged not the Church because he was an Apostate, will your Majesty,
being a Christian, avenge the injury done to the Synagogue?</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; And what will Christ hereafter say to you? Do you not remember what
he said to holy David by the prophet Nathan? 'I have chosen thee the youngest of
thy brethren, and from private life have made thee Emperor. <A NAME="p265"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|265</SPAN></A>
I have placed thy offspring upon the Imperial throne. I have put barbarous
nations under thy feet, I have given thee peace, I have delivered thine enemy
captive into thy hands. Thou hadst no corn to support thy army, I opened to thee
the enemies' gates, the enemies' granaries, by their own hand; they gave thee
the very stores which they had provided for themselves. I confounded the
counsels of thy enemy, so that he laid bare his own plans. The very usurper of
thy empire I so bound, and so fettered his mind, that although he had the means
of flying from you he shut himself in with all his followers, as if fearing lest
any should escape you. His lieutenant<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> and his forces on the other
element, whom I had before dispersed to prevent their combining to make war on
thee, I now called together again to render thy victory complete. Thy army, an
assemblage of many fierce nations, I caused to keep faith and peace and concord,
as if they had been one nation. And when there was imminent danger lest the
perfidious plots of the barbarians should penetrate the Alps, I gave thee
victory within the very barrier of the Alps, that thy victory might be without
loss. Thus I made thee to triumph over thy enemy, and thou art giving my enemies
a triumph over my people.'</p>
<p>23. Was it not the very reason why Maximus was abandoned, that before he set
out on his expedition, hearing that a synagogue had been burnt at Rome, he sent
an edict thither, acting as if he were the guardian of public order. Wherefore
the Christians said, No good awaits this man. That king is become a Jew, and we
have heard of him as a protector of order, but Christ, who died for sinners,
shortly after put him to the proof<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>. And if this was said of words
only, what will be said of actual punishment? So he was soon defeated by the
Franks and by the Saxons, in Sicily, at Siscia <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>, at Petavio, and in
every <A NAME="p266"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|266</SPAN></A> quarter of the globe. What has a devout man in common with an unbeliever? The
precedents of his impiety ought to be obliterated together with the impious man
himself. That which injured the vanquished, that at which he stumbled, the
victor ought to condemn, not to imitate.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; Now I have recounted these things to you not as though you were
ungrateful; rather I have spoken of them as being rightly bestowed, that
reminded thereby you may love much, as being one on whom much has been bestowed.
To Simon's answer our Lord thus replied, <i>Thou hast rightly judged; </i>and
then, turning straightway to the woman who had anointed His feet with ointment,
and was the type of the Church, He said to Simon, <i>Wherefore I say unto thee,
her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much: but to whom little
is forgiven, the same loveth little. </i>This is that woman who entered the
house of the Pharisee, and cast out the Jew, but gained Christ. For the Church
shut out the Synagogue, and why is it now attempted, that, with the servant of
Christ, that is, from the breast of faith, and abode of Christ, the Synagogue
should shut out the Church.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; It is from affection and regard for your Majesty, that I have
introduced these things into my pleading. The beneficence which has led you, at
my request, to liberate many persons from exile, from prison, from the extreme
penalties of death, obliges me to incur the danger of offending you for the sake
of your own good, rather than lose in one moment that privilege of every Bishop
which I have for so long possessed. For no man can feel greater confidence than
he who zealously loves, no man certainly ought to injure him who is careful for
his well-being. And yet it is not the loss of favour I deprecate, but the danger
to salvation.</p>
<p>26. Yet how important it is that your Majesty should not think of enquiry or
punishment in a matter with regard to which no one up to this time has ever held
enquiry or inflicted punishment! It is a grievous thing to hazard your faith for
the sake of Jews. When Gideon killed the consecrated calf, the Gentiles <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
said, Let the gods <A NAME="p267"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|267</SPAN></A> themselves avenge this affront towards them. Who is to avenge the Synagogue?
Christ Whom they slew, Whom they denied? Or will God the Father avenge them,
seeing that by rejecting the Son they have rejected the Father also. Who is to
avenge the heresy of the Valentinians? how will your Piety be able to avenge
them, seeing that you have commanded them to be shut out, and forbidden them to
meet together? And should I bring forward to you the example of King Josiah as
approved of God, will you condemn in this case that for which he is praised.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; But if you do not place sufficient confidence in me, let your
Majesty command the presence of those bishops whom you do approve, and let the
question be discussed, what ought to be done so as not to injure the Faith. If
in financial matters you consult your Courts, how much more fitting is it that
in the cause of religion you should consult the Bishops of the Lord?</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Let your Clemency consider what dangerous spies and liers in wait
the Church has against her, if they find ever so small an opening they will
plant a dart therein. I speak after the manner of men; but God is feared more
than men, and is rightly preferred to Emperors themselves. If any man thinks
obedience should be paid to a friend, a parent, or a neighbour, am I wrong in
deeming that God should be obeyed, and that in preference to all others. Let
your Majesty consult for your own well-being, or suffer me to consult for mine.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; What shall I hereafter answer, if it shall appear that by an edict
issued from hence Christians have been slain by the sword, or beaten to death
with clubs or thongs loaded with lead? How shall I justify such an act, how
shall I excuse it to those Bishops who having discharged the office of the
priesthood for thirty years, nay for many more, have now bitterly to bewail,
being deprived of their sacred functions and called to undertake municipal
offices. If <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> those who fight for you are set free after a certain period of
service, how much more ought you to consider those <A NAME="p268"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|268</SPAN></A>
who fight for God! How I repeat, shall I defend this to the Bishops who
complain in behalf of the clergy, and write word that the Churches are overborne
by violent oppression.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; This however I desired should be made known to your Majesty; about
this you will deign to deliberate and direct according to your will; but as to
that which distresses and rightly distresses myself, exclude and reject it from
your consideration. You do yourself whatsoever you have commanded to be done;
even if he<sup> <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A></sup> do it not, I would rather that you should be merciful
than that he should refuse to do what he has been commanded.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; Here are persons in dealing with whom you ought still to invite and
earn the Clemency of God towards the Roman empire; here are persons for whom
rather than for yourself you have to hope; let their grace, their well-being,
appeal to you in what I now say. I fear your entrusting your cause to the
judgement of others. As yet you are committed to nothing. Herein I will pledge
myself for you to our God, fear not your oath. That change cannot be displeasing
to God which is made for His honour. You have no need to alter your former
letter whether it be yet dispatched or not, but command another to be written
which shall be replete with faith and piety. It is open to you to change, it is
not open to me to keep back the truth.</p>
<p>32.&nbsp; You have forgiven the people of Antioch <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
their offence
against you, you have recalled the daughters of your enemy <A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>, you
have committed them to be nurtured by their relative, you have bestowed money
from your treasury on the mother of your enemy. This great piety, this great
faith towards God will be obscured by your present act. Having thus spared your
armed foes, and preserved your enemies, do not, I beseech you, so eagerly seek
for vengeance upon Christians. <A NAME="p269"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|269</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>33. And now I entreat your Majesty not to disdain to listen to my fears both
for yourself and myself; for it is the saying of an holy man, <i>Woe is me,
wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people? </i>is it that I should
incur the risk of offending God? Assuredly I have done what is most respectful
to you: I have sought that you should listen to me in the palace, that you might
not have to listen to me in the Church.</p>

'diocese' which included Syria, Palestine, Cilicia, Cyprus, Mesopotamia, and
some adjacent districts, and corresponded to the Patriarchate of Antioch in the
ecclesiastical division. It was originally under one chief called 'Comes
orientis,' but it would appear from this passage, as is asserted by Gothofred, that the
civil and military functions had been divided, and there were now two officers,
'Comes orientis militarium partium,' and 'Comes orientis civilium partium.' The
subject is somewhat obscure.</p>

first been violently enraged, sent them a free pardon. This was in the previous
