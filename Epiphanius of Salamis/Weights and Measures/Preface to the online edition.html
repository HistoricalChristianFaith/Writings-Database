to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>This work is lost in the Greek original, although the majority of the first
half is cited by other authors.&nbsp; A Syriac translation, with slight
expansions, exists complete, and this translation was made from it.&nbsp; The
book was published in 1935, but the copyright does not seem to have been
renewed, and the translation is therefore in the public domain in the USA.</p>

<p>Deviations from the Greek are highlighted. Not all the footnotes have been
transcribed: indeed originally I did not intend to transcribe many.&nbsp;
However the scanning software -- Abbyy Finereader 7 -- did such a good job that
I had hardly anything to do to include most of them.&nbsp; Some 20 or so were
omitted, as concerned solely with details of the Syriac text.&nbsp; I regret my
inability to transcribe Hebrew or Syriac letters -- words so written have been
replaced with one or more '@' symbols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The printed text also contains small monochrome pictures of the pages of
manuscript A, and a full collation of manuscript B.&nbsp; Neither are included
here.&nbsp; To transcribe the latter would involve immense effort.&nbsp; I only
have access to a photocopy of the book, and the photocopied images of the
manuscript pages are not very good.&nbsp; I may place these on the CDROM in due
course, if I can get reasonable results from them.</p>

<p>Finally the Greek text where presented has been rendered for the first time
on this site using unicode, with the Windows Palatino Linotype font.&nbsp; I do
not claim to have solved all the mysteries of doing this, so apologise for any
display problems.</p>
