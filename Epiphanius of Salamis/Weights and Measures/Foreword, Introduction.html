<h3 align="center">FOREWORD</h3>
<p>Just to refresh the memory of some of us who do not come fresh from work upon
him, Epiphanius was born about 315 and died a.d. 403. He is thus an older
contemporary of a famous pair, Jerome and Rufinus, both born in the neighborhood
of 340, the latter dying in 410 while the former lived until 420. During their
eastern residence both of these men became acquainted with the old fellow, and
both at one period of their lives admired him, Jerome's admiration, as well as
his life, outlasting that of Rufinus. Jerome, himself a linguist of parts, was
particularly taken with Epiphanius' knowledge of five tongues: Hebrew, Syriac,
Egyptian, Greek, and Latin.</p>
<p>Epiphanius was born almost in the very middle of Palestine, perhaps of Jewish
parentage or extraction. In his youth he spent a considerable time in Egypt,
attracted by and presently drawn into narrowly orthodox, anti-Origenistic,
monastic circles. The rest of his life he passed in spreading this type of
orthodox monasticism and combating all heresies, tracing them all to Origen and
Origenism. This brought him not indeed one of the great bishoprics, nor a
patriarchate, but a position not without influence as bishop of Constantia
(Salamis) in Cyprus, which chair he occupied for thirty-five years (367-402).</p>
<p>His quarrels and his writings show Epiphanius to have had a crabbed old
single-track mind, and the track he covers is usually a sidetrack. He clearly
knew too much for his limited understanding. His style is discursive; his
thought is poorly organized. Good and bad information, important and unimportant
matters, stand side by side and form a rather unsavory mess. Hence the study and
editing of his works, a thorny subject at best, has attracted few students and
lags behind that of his contemporaries. In the case of his <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F08;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span></i>,<i>
</i>a summary of what he considered the true faith, that does not matter so
much, for it is little used at any time. His <i>Panarion, </i>a statement about
eighty heresies and the remedies for them, is another matter. Here, after all,
there is much information not to be found elsewhere. No work of similar bulk and
compass on the same subject was produced by any medieval Christian. Its fame,
indeed, exceeds its merit. <A NAME="pviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|viii</SPAN></A> Yet,
as is often the case in such encyclopedic works, it was the best for want of a
better; and so it continued to be used and quoted, especially in the East,
throughout the Middle Ages and well into modern times. It should be properly
edited and thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>The work with a few elements of which this Foreword deals is usually quoted,
in whatever language (Greek, Latin, Syriac, etc.) it may be, as a book or essay
on <i>Weights and Measures. </i>This title is clearly not the one which
Epiphanius gave to it. We do not know what Epiphanius himself called it. From
its contents it might be designated as a brief introduction to the Bible. Such
general introductions, however, presently grew and multiplied; and in this case
Epiphanius' work, not remaining alone in the field, proved clearly not to be the
best.</p>
<p>The one feature of this particular work of Epiphanius which did remain unique
in the Christian and scriptural field was the extensive statement on biblical
weights, measures, and related subjects into which, with his usual
discursiveness and lack of organizatory ability, the addleheaded old pedant
permitted himself to be drawn. No one else covered this ground to anything like
the same extent; and so on this matter Epiphanius remained once more the best,
and as such is quoted throughout the Middle Ages, especially by Syriac writers.
In editing Barhebraeus (a.d. 1226-72) and in studying the Karkaphensians and
their philological statements, one constantly meets quotations from or
references to Epiphanius. The anti-Origenic orientation of both major branches
of the Syriac church, Nestorian and Monophysite (Jacobite), may have something
to do with his popularity in those quarters. In any case, in order to trace the
sources of Barhebraeus, Karkaphensian philology, and much else in Syriac
literature, it proved necessary to recur time and again to Epiphanius' <i>Weights
and Measures.</i></p>
<p>Of this redoubtable work only fragments remain in Greek. The complete work
was preserved in Syriac translation only. Of this Syriac translation there are
more or less voluminous extracts in every manuscript of Karkaphensian textual
studies. The whole work exists, so far as we know, in two manuscripts, both in
the British Museum, one from the middle of the 7th, the other from the 9th
century.</p>
<p>As we got under way in the Oriental Institute on the Peshitta or <A NAME="pix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ix</SPAN></A>
Syriac Bible projects, it soon became evident that the Dindorf-Migne Greek
material did not suffice for our needs. This had become manifest likewise to our
last predecessor in a similar undertaking, the curious Paul de Lagarde of
Gottingen. Lagarde had therefore undertaken an extensive study and a series of
editions of this Epiphanius material. In his usual fashion he scattered this
work around in a series of odd publications, many of them in small editions.
These are not easy to get and, when obtained, generally not easy to use. The
Syriac text, for example, he printed in Hebrew letters, because there was no
Syriac type in Gottingen. His translation into German is curious. In various
notes voicing his disgust and alleging (a thing Lagarde does not often admit)
his incompetence, he shows that this was to him no labor of love. J&uuml;licher's
statement in Pauly-Wissowa that the text is &quot;sehr schlecht ediert&quot; by
Lagarde is, indeed, too harsh a judgment. But a better, more easily accessible,
more usable, and in every way more definitive edition than that of Lagarde,
dated 1880, was clearly called for.</p>
<p>So we undertook a new edition, with a carefully annotated English
translation. The work was given under my supervision to a younger doctor of our
department, a diligent and careful southerner, James E. Dean. We soon found that
editing any Epiphanius text was no joke, least of all in a Syriac translation
for much of which the original Greek is missing. Piecing together the oddments
of information and misinformation which he considers knowledge, sorting them,
getting at the meaning of his sloppy style of expression, is often much like
attempting to create order out of chaos; it demands heavenly patience and
superhuman, perhaps superdivine, ingenuity.</p>
<p>Epiphanius' knowledge of Hebrew, or at least of the Hebrew Bible, was not all
that Jerome's praise would lead us to believe. Among other things he quotes Ps.
141:1 (in &sect; 6) in a barbarous Hebrew text form not otherwise known. This is
clearly not a valuable variant in any sense, nor does he preserve thereby an
otherwise unknown ancient text. It is manifest on the face of it that either he
or some rabbi spoofing him, as a little later such men spoofed Mohammed, is
rendering back into Hebrew perhaps a Greek or Latin translation or at any rate
the general sense of the passage. If a Jewish rabbi committed the atrocity, he
may have been trying to avoid defiling the <i>ipsissima verba </i><A NAME="px"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|x</SPAN></A>
of the sacred text by keeping them out of the hands of the unbelieving goy and
fooling him into accepting others. If Epiphanius himself made a mere show of his
knowledge of Hebrew, it is unforgivable that he placed something of his own
concoction in place of the original, which was easily obtainable and was well
known to his pet adversary Origen before him and to his admiring friend Jerome
in his own time. This is merely an example of Epiphanius' inaccuracy and
sloppiness.</p>
<p>As touching at most points on Greek and Latin and therefore of more general
interest, there may here be presented solutions, or attempted solutions, of
lexicographical problems found not at all or not in full in lexicons, Syriac,
Greek, and Latin, and, at least so far as I know, not taken up or not fully
studied previously:</p>
<p>&sect; 20. &quot;Diocletian @@ (<i><span class=Greek>&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span></i>)<i>
</i>ceased to reign.&quot; The curious Syriac transliteration belongs in the
Syriac lexica, the fully Hellenized verb in the Greek lexica.</p>
<p>&sect; 21. Syriac: &quot;craft of the oil press.&quot; The Greek, <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F10;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span></i>
(Breslau ms., <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F10;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span></i>),<i> </i>is
not in Liddell and Scott, though Epiphanius is elsewhere quoted. Here he clearly
attests the use of the word in Cyprus in the 4th century.</p>
<p>@@@, passive of '<i>akil, </i>&quot;to measure,&quot; is not merely &quot;to
be measured,&quot; &quot;to be defined by measure&quot;; it clearly means here
&quot;to be used as a measure&quot; by such and such a people. This meaning is
not found in any Syriac lexicon.</p>
<p>&sect; 24. Epiphanius expatiates on the mystery of the number 22: 22 works of
God, 22 generations to Jacob, 22 books of the Bible to Esther, 22 letters of the
alphabet, 22 <i>xestai </i>in the Hebrew and the Roman <i>modius. </i>In Hebrew
a child learns to <i>aleph, </i>in Greek <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F00;&#x03BB;&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span>;
</i>the latter, known as from <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F00;&#x03BB;&#x03C6;&#x1F71;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;</span>, </i>2d
aor. inf., is here apparently used in a sense for which we would say &quot;to
learn one's ABC's.&quot; No lexicon, so far as I know, exhibits this crochet of
Epiphanius' learning.</p>
<p>&sect; 43. In connection with <font face="SPIonic"><i>xou~j</i></font> (6 or 8 <i>xestai,
sextarii </i>[cf. &sect; 55], pints) the Syriac clearly furnishes by transliteration
<i><span class=Greek>&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C2;</span></i>. The word is labored over by Lagarde
unsuccessfully. So far as I know no Greek lexicon has the combination. The
transliteration belongs in the Syriac lexicon.</p>
<p>&sect; 46. The word <i>litra </i>is said to mean <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F10;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x1F77; &#x1F10;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>. </i>The <i>li</i>,<i> @@</i>, &quot;to me,&quot; fits. For
the <i>tra </i>we can find nothing that makes good sense, <A NAME="pxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xi</SPAN></A>
though in &sect; 54 Epiphanius dogmatically makes the statement that in Hebrew
and/or Syriac it means &quot;it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&sect; 54. In connection with <i>litra, </i>where it comes up the second time,
Epiphanius mentions its Latin equivalent, <i>libra, </i>which, he says, by @@
means &quot;equality.&quot; The pointing indicates a foreign, in this case
almost certainly Greek, compound term. Seeking for Greek equivalents to the
members of the compound, one could see fairly easily that <i>tajjev, metajjev, </i>&quot;prepare,&quot;
was some form of Greek e9toi=moj, that the ending <i>-uth </i>indicated a Greek
abstract ending -<i>ia</i>, perhaps <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F11;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span></i>,
and that <i>mell<sup>e</sup>tha = word = <span class=Greek>&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>.
</i>The abstract ending, in Semitic necessarily placed in the first member of
the genitival combination, might, indeed probably would, in Greek be found at
the end of the compound.<sup>1</sup> Trying this out, we arrive at <i>etoimologia</i>.
Since the itacistic equation <i>oi </i>&gt; <i>u </i>fits exactly the time
demanded for this Syriac,<sup>2</sup> we arrive at <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F10;&#x03C4;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>
</i>as the original Greek, and this fits perfectly into the context. Up to a
short time ago I thought that I had been the first to see this; and, as far as
our form and context are concerned, this remains true. Then I happened upon a
note by the fine old Syriac scholar G. Hoffmann of Kiel. In this note<sup>3</sup>
he takes up the vain labors of E. Nestle and N&ouml;ldeke over the similar, but
clearly more Syriacized, term <i>tujdva d<sup>e</sup>mell<sup>e</sup>tha </i>used
by the highly learned Jacob of Elessa. For <i>tujava </i>Nestle had arrived only
at <i><span class=Greek>&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C5;&#x1F75;,</span></i>
with which of course he
could do nothing; and Noldeke had suggested that it stood for a Greek technical
term, but had not supplied it. Hoffmann tersely states: &quot;@@ = <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F15;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span></i>
= <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F14;&#x03C4;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span></i>. @@ @@<i> =
<span class=Greek>&#x1F11;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>
= <span class=Greek>&#x1F10;&#x03C4;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, </i>denn <i>oi</i> = <i>u</i>.&quot;
Our work therefore supplies only the first known occurrence of this combination,
its older form (later Syriacized further by Jacob), and the greater precision
attained by Sturtevant for the equation <i>oi</i> = u.</p>
<p>Syriac usage for &quot;etymology&quot; is interesting.<sup>4</sup> The study
of Greek <A NAME="pxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xii</SPAN></A> was continued seriously
and intensively in the Syriac world of scholarship to the 8th or 9th century (by
translators for the Arabs), and a smattering of it remained to the 13th century
(Barhebraeus). So we find the grammarians Severus bar Shakko, Elias of Sobha,
and Barhebraeus (8th/9th-13th century) using @@ and derivatives in this simple
transliteration. The translators of Aristotle, and following them the
lexicographers Bar <sup>c</sup>Ali and Bar Bahlul (10th-11th century),
transliterate @@, perhaps with the rough breathing of <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F11;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span></i>,
but possibly simply equating @ (<i>h</i>)<i> </i>with <i>e </i>since the two
letters are related in origin. Finally, perhaps following the lead of the Arabs,
the late Ebedjesu uses a proper translation, @@ <i>( = deductio, derivatio).</i></p>
<p>&sect; 59. <i><span class=Greek>&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>,
<span class=Greek>&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>,

</i>(or <i><span class=Greek>&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03B9;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span></i>)<i>
</i>are attested by Syriac transliterations. They are measures of the ground
areas which can be sown by a <i>sa&amp;ton </i>or seah, a kor, and a cab
respectively of grain. These forms in these meanings do not seem to occur in any
Greek or Syriac lexicon.</p>
<p>&sect; 82. @@ is an astronomical term, but not = <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F00;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>.

configuration of stars,&quot; fits the context perfectly. The constellations
Pleiades and Orion as mentioned in Job 9:9 (at least as Epiphanius reads it) are
the &quot;configurations of stars&quot; to which the reference applies.</p>
<p>It remains to express our appreciation of the kindness of the British Museum
in making available to the Oriental Institute photostatic copies of both its
Syriac manuscripts concerned, the older of which we here reproduce in facsimile.
Our reproductions are two-thirds of actual size. Where the signs were too faint
in the photostats they have been strengthened by Dr. Anis Kh. Frayha.</p>

<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p align="center"><b>THE AUTHOR</b></p>
<p>Among the Greek Fathers of the Christian church Epiphanius holds an important
place. This is not because of his literary ability or his constructive
achievements, but rather because of his great and far-reaching influence, in the
main reactionary. In literary attainment he takes very low rank, but his
influence was much greater. Jiilicher says that he converted Jerome from an
admirer of Origen to an antagonist, and that it was essentially through his
influence that after a.d. 400 the free scientific theology of Origen was
outlawed by the church. And, again, &quot;etwas R&auml;tselhaftes beh&auml;lt die St&auml;rke
des Einflusses, den dieser &uuml;beraus beschr&auml;nkte Mann auf seine Zeitgenossen und
die Nachwelt &uuml;bte.&quot; <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>
<p>Epiphanius was born about a.d. 315 near Eleutheropolis in Palestine. He is
thought to have been of Jewish parentage. While yet a youth he went to Egypt.
The monastic movement was just getting under way, and he became a staunch
adherent. At the age of twenty he returned to Palestine, and at this time he met
Jerome and Rufinus and the three became firm friends, though the friendship with
Rufinus was later lost in the dispute over Origen. Epiphanius founded a
monastery and became its head. He was ordained a presbyter and rose to the rank
of bishop. He attained fame for his piety and orthodoxy, and it was because of
this fame that he was elevated to the bishopric of Constantia (Salamis), the
principal city of Cyprus, where he remained from 367 until his death in 403. In
Cyprus his two great ambitions were the establishment of monasticism and the
uprooting of heresy. He planted monasteries throughout the island, and combated
heresy both in personal disputations and in his writings. His first book was the
<i><span class=Greek>&#x1F08;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>
</i>(&quot;Anchored&quot;), a discourse on the true faith.
His second and most famous was <i><span class=Greek>&#x039A;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03B1;&#x1F31;&#x03C0;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span></i>
(called also by the
Latinized name <i>Panarion), </i>in which he undertook to refute eighty
heresies, beginning as far back as the pre-Christian Samaritans, <A NAME="p2"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|2</SPAN></A>
Sadducees, and Stoics. In his enthusiastic heresy-hunting he came to believe
that Origen was the source of practically all the later heresies, especially of
Arianism. He brought Jerome to this view, and one of the last acts of his life
was a combat with Chrysostom. The story of his final parting from the Bishop of
Constantinople <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> is not to be taken literally, but it reveals
something of the spirit of Epiphanius and of his times. Having rebuked
Chrysostom for harboring heretics, he expressed the wish that Chrysostom might
not die a bishop. The latter is said to have rejoined with a wish that
Epiphanius might not live to get home. Both these things actually came to pass.
Epiphanius died at sea on his return to Cyprus, in 403.</p>
<p><i>Weights and Measures </i>was composed in 392. Epiphanius also composed a
treatise on the twelve stones in the breastplate of Aaron. This latter does not
exist in its complete form, but it is most fully preserved in a Latin
translation. Two of Epiphanius' letters have been preserved, one to Jerome, the
other to John of Jerusalem. In 1915 Sir E. A. Wallis Budge published a Coptic
version of a <i>Discourse on the Holy Virgin </i>by Epiphanius.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
There exists also the <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F08;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C6;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span></i>,<i> </i>an abridgment of the <i>Panarion.
</i>But this is little more than a compilation of the various epitomes prefixed
by Epiphanius to the various volumes (<i>&tau;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&iota;</i>) of the <i>Panarion, </i>and
it is the opinion of Karl Holl that the <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F08;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C6;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span></i>
was put in its
present form by someone else.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><sup> </sup>The Migne edition of the Fathers gives
other things with which the name of Epiphanius has been associated, but which
are evidently not from his hand.</p>
<p align="center"><b>THE &quot;WEIGHTS AND MEASURES&quot;</b></p>
<p>The complete <i>Weights and Measures </i>exists in Syriac only. In fact, it
is not known what was the original title, if it had one. Not one of the older
Greek manuscripts has the title from the hand of the original scribe. The Codex
Parisinus Graecus 835 has the title <i><span class=Greek>&#x03A0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F76; &#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span>, </i>added by
a later hand. Codex Vindobonensis suppl. gr. <A NAME="p3"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|3</SPAN></A>
91 has some of its material disarranged. <i>Weights and Measures </i>is
divided into two parts, and there is no title for the first. At the beginning of
the second part someone has added the foregoing Greek title in the margin. The
text of this part begins: <i><span class=Greek>&#x03A0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F76; &#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2; &#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x03B3;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;</span>-<br>
<span class=Greek>&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2;</span><br>
<span class=Greek>&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span></i>  (sic) <i><span class=Greek>&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F00;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B8;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03B4;&#x03B7;&#x03BB;&#x1F7D;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span></i>.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><i>
</i>The oldest Syriac manuscript has the title: @@. It is readily apparent that the title is
inadequate, for the work is really &quot;die Urform eines Bibellexikons,&quot;
as J&uuml;licher well says.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Viedebantt says: &quot;Librum enim non ab
ipso Epiphanio ita inscriptum esse inde luce clarius apparet, quod mensurae et
pondera exigua tantum libelli parte continentur, cum ceteras paginas varia rerum
materies expleat.&quot;<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Indeed, the work contains much material that
has no relation to weights or measures, and it could much more appropriately be
called a Bible handbook.</p>
<p align="center"><b>THE MANUSCRIPTS</b></p>
<p>As stated above, the <i>Weights and Measures </i>in its complete form exists
in only the Syriac version, of which there are two manuscripts, both in the
British Museum. The Museum has numbered them Or. Add. 17148 (the older) and Or.
Add. 14620. According to the colophon at the end of the older, it was written
between a.d. 648 and a.d. 659. The colophon is partly gone and no longer gives
the month or the last figure in the year number. But this is certainly the
oldest known manuscript of Epiphanius. The other Syriac manuscript is thought to
be from the 9th century. Both are on vellum. Hitherto the Syriac text has been
published only by Paul de Lagarde.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> He attempted to reconstruct the
original text on the basis of the two manuscripts mentioned, giving his
collation in footnotes. But no Syriac type was available at Gottingen, and the
result is a most unusual specimen of Syriac printed in Hebrew letters. The
Pauly-Wissowa <i>Real-Encyclop&auml;die </i>says it is &quot;sehr schlecht
ediert.&quot;<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><sup> <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>In the original language <i>Weights and Measures </i>is preserved in a
mutilated form only, in five principal manuscripts and a number of fragments.
Manuscripts important for other works of Epiphanius are not considered here
except incidentally. The five major manuscripts are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Codex Jenensis (ms. Bose 1), a bombycine manuscript dated 1304. Holl
says this comes from Codex Urbinas 17/18, a manuscript of the 12th or 13th
century no longer containing anything about weights and measures. This
manuscript came into the possession of Dindorf, who issued his edition of
Epiphanius in 1859-62. But as early as 1543 Janus Cornarius had published a
Latin translation of the manuscript; Joannes Oporinus published the Greek itself
in 1544.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Codex Rehdigeranus 240 (Breslau) is a parchment of the 15th century,
said by Holl to have been derived from Codex Jenensis.<A HREF="#10"><sup>10</sup></A><sup> </sup>Dindorf
says, &quot;ab codice Jenensi non discrepans nisi in rebus levissimis.&quot; <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
Lagarde used this manuscript in his edition of the Greek text.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Codex Parisinus Graecus 835, a paper manuscript of the 16th century.
Holl says it was derived from Codex Rehdigeranus 240.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Dindorf
pronounces it to have been copied from a codex very much like
(&quot;simillimus&quot;) Codex Jenensis.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> This manuscript was the
basis for <i>Weights and Measures </i>in the edition of Epiphanius published by
Dionysius Petau, or Petavius, in 1622. Dindorf used the edition of Petavius, and
Lagarde used the edition of Oporinus, as one of his main sources.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Codex Vindobonensis suppl. gr. 91, a paper manuscript which Dindorf
attributes to the 14th century. He adds: &quot;Ipse quoque Jenensi est
simillimus, propria vero sibi habet vitia orthographica imperiti librarii
diphthongos et vocales pronunciatione similes saepissime confundentis, quod raro
commisit antiquior et peritior codicis Jenensis librarius.&quot;<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
Holl calls it a descendant or a twin of Codex Urbinas 17/18,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> from
which Codex Jenensis also is said to have come. <A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A>
Viedebantt says of this manuscript: &quot;Lectiones nusquam adnotatae sunt.&quot;<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></p>
<p>5. Codex Laurentianus VI 12, a bombycine codex of the 14th century, of the
same ancestry as Codex Jenensis according to Holl.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A><sup> </sup>So far as the
writer is aware, this last has never been used in any edition. The known Greek
manuscripts containing material on weights and measures thus seem to be very
closely related.</p>
<p align="center"><b>FRAGMENTARY MANUSCRIPTS</b></p>
<p>In the preface to his fourth volume of the works of Epiphanius, Dindorf
quotes two fragments of the first part of <i>Weights and Measures. </i>The
subjects and sources are as follows:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On the LXX translators and <i><span class=Greek>&#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x1F71;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>. </i>This
was first edited by Montfaucon, in his <i>Prolegomena ad Origenis Hexapla, </i>from
Codex Parisinus Graecus 146 (earlier called Regius 1807) and a certain Codex
Vaticanus.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; On the creation of the world. This was taken by Dindorf from Codex
Venetus Marcianus Graecus 125.</p>
<p>The first three Greek manuscripts previously listed <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
deal for the
most part with the weights and measures per se in a very fragmentary fashion.
Their text is in general agreement with the Syriac version in the discussion of
the kor, <i>lethekh, </i>homer, bath, <i>m<sup>e</sup>nasis, medimnos, </i>seah,
and <i>modius. </i>But here divergence appears. The Greek material on all the
remaining weights and measures is but a small fraction of what the Syriac has
preserved. In his <i>Quaestiones Epiphanianae </i>Viedebantt lists various
fragments containing material on weights and measures which is much the same as
the concluding portions of the Greek manuscripts just mentioned. Some of these
fragments are to be found in Lagarde's <i>Symmicta </i>I (Gottingen, 1877)
210-25. Others are in Fridericus Hultsch, <i>Metrologicorum scriptorum reliquiae
</i>I (Lipsiae, 1864) 267-76. For his own material and for Hultsch's Lagarde has
a convenient index in his <i>Symmicta </i>II 184 f. There is an old Latin
fragment in Hultsch's second volume (pp. 100-106). <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A>
Viedebantt notes also certain Greek fragments perhaps not yet published.<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
Besides the foregoing there is a considerable extract in the Karkaphensian
manuscript belonging to Mar Severius, archbishop of Syria and the Lebanon, a
photograph of which is owned by the University of Chicago (fol. 397a, 1. 23 -
fol. 398a, 1. 16).<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A></p>
<p align="center"><b>THE PRESENT EDITION</b></p>
<p>This is essentially an edition of the Syriac version of the <i>Weights and
Measures. </i>Or. Add. 17148 of the British Museum is here reproduced
photographically, following our translation. Then comes the collation of Or.
Add. 14620, the Lagarde edition of 1880, and the unpublished fragment of
Epiphanius in the Karkaphensian manuscript mentioned above. Square brackets in
the translation indicate words supplied from the margin of the basic manuscript
or from Or. Add. 14620. Parentheses inclose words required by the English idiom.
Footnotes indicate the striking Greek variants as gleaned from the editions of
Migne, Dindorf, and Lagarde. A single folio of Or. Add. 14620 which could not be
conveniently collated appears as Appendix I. The translation of section 21 of
the Greek forms Appendix II, and the fragmentary conclusion of the Greek
manuscripts has been translated and appears as Appendix III. The weights and
measures discussed have been summarized in Appendix IV.</p>
<p align="center"><b>SOME PROBLEMS</b></p>
<p>Anyone making a careful study of the <i>Weights and Measures </i>will find
himself confronting some very puzzling problems, such as these:</p>
<p>1. How did the introductory three sections of the Syriac version arise?<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
The Greek manuscripts have nothing like them, unless it be their curtailed
conclusion dealing specifically with weights and measures. The first of these
sections of the Syriac may well be in its original position, for in both the <i><span class=Greek>&#x1F08;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>
</i>and the <i>Panarion </i>an introduction gives the circumstances of the
compilation. The two sections that follow here claim to be &quot;a list in brief
of the topics found in this treatise,&quot; but it is neither a complete nor an
orderly list. It might serve as a <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A> summary of most of the latter part of <i>Weights and Measures, </i>if the
order of the two sections were reversed. Epiphanius prefixed a sort of summary
to each volume (<i>&tau;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>) of the <i>Panarion, </i>and he may well have done
the same for the two parts of <i>Weights and Measures. </i>If so, the summary of
the first part was lost, or nearly so; for the fragment edited by Montfalcon,
cited above, is called an epitome by Viedebantt.<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> The curtailed
portion of the Greek dealing with the weights and measures per se may be from
the summary of that part. Just how the portion of the summary preserved in the
Syriac found its present place, a part of it in reverse order, may never be
determined.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How did the long interpolation in section 21 originate? This is a
mere catalogue of measures and is unmistakably interpolated in the midst of the
discussion of the kor in both the Greek and the Syriac. It must have been
inserted by some clumsy scribe, and seems to be part of an index for <i>Weights
and Measures. </i>In both word order and phrasing it is surprisingly like part
of the summary prefixed to the Syriac version, and here Viedebantt would find
its source.<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Where did Epiphanius get his data on the Ptolemies and the Roman
emperors? Most certainly from the <i>Chronicle </i>of Eusebius; for he expressly
quotes that work elsewhere, and the reigns of the Roman emperors agree in
remarkable fashion. But this is not the whole story. His figures do not exactly
agree with any existing version of Eusebius (the original being long since
lost), but there is one most interesting agreement with the Bodleian manuscript
of Jerome's version. Cleopatra reigned 51-30 B.C., but Epiphanius says
thirty-two years. All the versions of Eusebius say twenty-two except this
manuscript of Jerome's. It read originally XXII, but someone has inserted
another X and thus made it XXXII.<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> Is it possible that this very
error misled Epiphanius? He and Jerome were intimate friends, and one of his
letters to Jerome is extant. Jerome called Epiphanius the
&quot;five-tongued,&quot; and Latin was one of the five.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Did Epiphanius complete his treatise on weights and measures, or did
he leave merely a first draft of an unfinished work? This latter <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A>
is the view of Lagarde, who says: &quot;ausserdem ist mir sicher, dass wir
kein herausgegebenes buch vor uns haben, sondern die abschrift einer kladde, in
welcher gleichwertige versuche, eine fassung zu gewinnen, gelegentlich
nebeneinander standen: diese sind in den verschiedenen abschriften je nach
belieben der kopisten gerettet worden.&quot;<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> It would surely be
strange for such a work as this, written in 392, to remain yet a mere first
draft upon the death of the author eleven years later, in 403. When the
character of the other works of Epiphanius is taken into consideration, there is
no need to regard the original which lies back of the Syriac version as
&quot;die abschrift einer kladde.&quot; His style was far from elegant and was
also repetitious. Moreover, in section 57 he seems to describe his method of
procedure in the composition of this work. He says: &quot;No one of those who
have met with these weights and measures which have been mentioned by us for the
second time can find fault, as though the writing were without purpose, instead
of to teach accuracy; for although we spoke of them heretofore somewhat briefly,
we have now set down for the sake of accuracy those things also that had been
abbreviated.&quot; Perhaps there is here a reference to the fact that he wrote
his summary first and later the more expanded form, as was the custom with
ancient Greek writers. Such considerations lead Viedebantt to challenge
Lagarde's statement and to conclude: &quot;Quare nihil est causae, cur cum
Lagardio non ab ipso Epiphanio librum editum esse sumamus.&quot;<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> It
ought to be added that, even in those sections for which no corresponding Greek
is preserved, the Syriac shows in many places unmistakable evidence of a Greek
original. This can be seen in the new translation here presented and in the
footnotes.</p>
<p align="center"><b>THE &quot;WEIGHTS AND MEASURES&quot; AMONG THE SYRIANS</b></p>
<p>As early as A.D. 200 Galen, a Greek physician, often made mention of
&quot;those writing on weights and measures.&quot; Dardanius wrote about weights
in the latter part of the 4th century, and Diodorus a little later. That this
work by Epiphanius was thus by no means indispensable among the Greeks may
account largely for the present state of the Greek text. It seems to have been
neglected because not <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A> recognized as of special value. But when translated into Syriac the work filled a
larger need and found for itself a much more secure place. As late as 1272
Epiphanius is frequently quoted by Barhebraeus in his <i>Awsar 'Raze </i>or
scholia on the Sacred Scriptures. The Syriac version of <i>Weights and Measures </i>was
so highly treasured that an extract from it is even found in the Karkaphensian
Massorah manuscript to which we have already referred.</p>
