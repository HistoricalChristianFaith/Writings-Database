<h3 align="center">THE TREATISE OF ST. EPIPHANIUS ON WEIGHTS AND MEASURES&nbsp;</h3>
<p align="center">(SYRIAC INTRODUCTORY SECTIONS)<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; [Further, it is well that we should know] what occasion induced
Saint Epiphanius to compose<sup> <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A><sup> </sup></sup>this
treatise on the measures and weights in the divine Scriptures. The occasion
arose in the church when Saint Epiphanius, bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, was
summoned by the God-fearing kings Valentinian,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius, by letter. There was dwelling in
Constantinople a certain venerable priest, Bardion by name, a Persian by race, a
learned man, eager to learn (whatever is of) value in the divine Scriptures. He
found weights and measures in the divine Scriptures; he sought information about
them from Saint Epiphanius, the bishop. Then, perceiving the diligence of the
one asking, he (the bishop) devoted himself to the task of collecting
(information) from all the divine Scriptures and a multitude of histories. And
when he had done this, he wrote it out in orderly fashion. And these things were
finally composed and written {45b} as follows.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A list in brief of the topics found in this treatise.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
Concerning weights. The talent, of 125 <i>librae.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> </i>The
<i>assarion,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> </i>100 <i>lepta, </i>by which (term <i>lepton)
</i>also the smallest (weight) among the Hebrews is translated. The <i>nomisma, </i>60
<i>assaria; </i>the <i>assarion, </i>however, consists of 100 <i>denaria.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
</i>The <i>nomisma </i>of silver; hence they say also silver (talent) in the
Scriptures. The <i>nomisma, </i>that is to say, the silver (talent), <A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A>
they divide into 6,000 <i>lepta; </i>it is also what accountants call the unit.
The <i>centenarius </i>of 100 <i>librae, </i>which the Romans invented. The <i>libra,
</i>12 ounces; but the ounce is 2 staters, and the stater 4 <i>zuze. </i>Two <i>zuze,
</i>1 shekel, which is one-fourth of an ounce. The <i>kodrantes, </i>which also
has the weight of 1 shekel, that is one-fourth of an ounce.<A HREF="#8"><sup>8</sup></A>
 {45c} But the <i>kodarion </i>is so named from the fact that it is tied up
(in a purse) when it is changed. There was also an obolus which contained
one-eighth of an ounce; it was of iron and in the form of an arrow. But there
was also another obolus that was coined of silver, one-eightieth of an ounce.
The <i>chalkoi </i>were found among the Egyptians, who originally made 8 to the
ounce, each one of which was a <i>zuz&#x00E5;. </i>The Italian mina, of 20 ounces; but
the barbarian, which is also the Theban, of 30 ounces. And, finally, they minted
other kinds also, sometimes of 2 <i>librae </i>and sometimes of 4 <i>librae. </i>The
<i>dichryson <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> </i>was half of the silver <i>(denarius),
</i>and the silver <i>(denarius) </i>was a <i>zuz&#x00E5;. </i>And this <i>dichryson </i>was
also finally called <i>repudiated, </i>because of him who had coined it. And
there is also a silver coin called the <i>folis, </i>having {45d} the weight of
half an ounce. And the <i>folis, </i>(so called) because of the roundness of its
form, is that which is found among the Hebrews as the @@@ ,<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
which, moreover, is 2 double <i>zuze </i>of silver. But among the Romans there
were formerly 125 <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> by number in the measure
called the <i>follis, </i>which is also the bag, that is to say, the purse.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
Two <i>lepta, </i>1 shekel, which is one-fourth of an ounce. Every <i>lepton, </i>an
obolus.</p>
<p>3. Concerning the measurement <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> of land and
measures (of capacity). The &quot;field&quot; <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> is
a land measure and consists of (the land sown by) 5 or 6 seahs. The kor is 30 <i>modii.
</i>The <i>lethekh </i>is 15 <i>modii, </i>the same as the great homer.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
The great homer, 15 <i>modii. </i>The bath, <A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A>
otherwise the little homer, 50 <i>xestai. </i>The seah, an overfull <i>modius, </i>that
is to say, because of its overflow, a <i>modius </i>and a {46a} quarter. The <i>modius,
</i>of 22 <i>xestai, </i>which is also the sacred measure. The cab, among some
one-fourth of a <i>modius, </i>among others one-fifth, and among a few
one-sixth. The <i>choinix, </i>among the Cyprians one-eighth of the <i>modius, </i>which
(with them) is 17 <i>xestai, </i>making 2 1/8 <i>xestai. </i>The <i>hyfi </i><A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A><i>
</i>of fine flour, being the same as the <i>choinix. </i>The handful of meal,
what the hand can grasp; and so the measure signifies as much as the hand can
hold.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> The ardeb, 72 <i>xestai, </i>which also is
found as a sacred measure. Three measures of fine flour, one-tenth, it is said,
of an ardeb, that is, 7 1/5 <i>xestai, </i>(in) every measure. But each measure
holds an omer; and, again, in every measure (are) 3 (little) omers, every one of
them 2 <i>xestai </i>and one-{46b} third and one-fifteenth. Three measures of
fine flour are not a measure but a kind, that is, broken grains of wheat that
have been ground and have fallen into baskets.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
The <i>nevel </i>of wine is a measure of 150 <i>xestai, </i>that is to say, 3
liquid seahs; for a liquid seah consists of 50 <i>xestai. </i>The <i>kollathon, </i>among
the Syrians half of a liquid seah, which is 25 <i>xestai. </i>The <i>shatifta </i><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><i>
</i>of ointment, a vessel round in form, containing a <i>libra </i>by weight,
that is to say, half a <i>xestes. </i>The <i>aporryma, </i>only among the
Thebans, which is half a <i>saites, </i>of 11 <i>xestai; </i>for a complete <i>saites
</i>is 22 <i>xestai. </i>The <i>kapsakes </i>of water, the great one of 12 <i>xestai;
</i>but the small one that was provided for Elijah <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
was of 4 <i>xestai. </i>The <i>kotyle </i>of oil, one-half a <i>xestes. </i>{46c}
The <i>kyathos, </i>a measure for mixed wine, the <i>xestes </i>being divided
sometimes into 6 parts, sometimes into 3. The <i>metretes </i>of wine; great is
the variation in this measure, but according to the sacred measure 72 <i>xestai.
</i>The <i>metretes </i>of oil indicates the same measure. The <i>tryblion, </i>shaped
like the <i>scutella, </i><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A><i> </i>but a measure
of half a <i>xestes. </i>The <i>xestes; </i>there is great variation in the <i>xestai,
</i>the Pontic being four times the Alexandrian, 8 <i>librae </i>in oil, but the
Italian 22 ounces, the Alexandrian 2 <i>librae, </i>the <i>castrensis </i>2 <i>librae
</i><A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A> and two-thirds and a little
(more), the Nicomedian 20 ounces. The amphora, said to be the same measure as
the <i>nevel, </i>for the Cyprians call a jar of 150 <i>xestai </i>an amphora.
The <i>shafitha, </i>which among those of Ashkelon is of 22 <i>xestai, </i>among
those of Azotus of 18 <i>xestai, </i>among those of Gaza {46d} of 14 <i>xestai. </i>The
hin, the great one, 18 <i>xestai, </i>which is one-fourth of a <i>metretes; </i>but
the sacred one is 9 <i>xestai. </i>The <i>chus, </i>the complete one, of 8 <i>xestai,
</i>but the sacred one of 6 <i>xestai. </i>The golden <i>stamnos,</i><A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A><i>
</i>which was of 4 <i>xestai, </i>in which was the manna. The <i>mares, </i>among
the Pontians 2 jars, each one of 10 <i>xestai, </i>which is 20 Alexandrian <i>xestai.
</i>The <i>kupros, </i>among them 2 <i>modii. </i>The <i>congiarium, </i>of 6 <i>xestai.
</i>The <i>m<sup>e</sup>nasis, </i>among the Cyprians and others 10 <i>modii </i>of
wheat or barley. The <i>medimnos </i>of the Cyprians varies; for those of
Constantia say 5 <i>modii, </i>but those of Paphos and the Sicilians say 4 1/2 <i>modii.
</i>Here ends the (list of) topics. <A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A></p>

<p>And these signs are employed in the prophetic writings:<sup><A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
</sup>{47b} @ for the rejection of the ancient people; @ for the rejection of
the law that is in the flesh; @ for the new covenant; @ for the calling of the
Gentiles; <i>@ </i>for the Messiah; <i>@ </i>for the promises to the ancient
people; <i>@ </i>for obscure passages in the Scriptures; @ for foreknowledge of
things going to take place. <A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;And inasmuch as some have also supplied the Scriptures with marks of
punctuation, these also are employed as marks of punctuation : acute (accent) <i>'</i>;
grave (accent) '; circumflex <sup>^</sup>; long (vowel)&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: overline">
</span>; short (vowel) <sup>@</sup>; rough (breathing) @ ;<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
smooth (breathing) <i>@ </i>;<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> apostrophe ';
hyphen -; <i>hypodiastole </i>@. Concerning the asterisk, the obelus, the <i>lemniscus,
</i>and the <i>hypolemniscus, </i>that is, the signs that are in the divine
Scriptures.<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> The asterisk is this *; and wherever
used it indicates that the word used occurs in the Hebrew, and occurs in Aquila
and Symmachus, and rarely also in Theodotion. {47c} But the seventy-two
translators passed it by and did not translate it, because such words were
repetitious and superfluous. And in elucidation of the things that have been
said,<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> let it be said by means of a brief
quotation, so that from the one instance you may understand others. There occurs
in the first part of Genesis <i>w''j 'dhm slw'jm sn' wths' mjwth sn'</i>, <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
which is translated, &quot;and Adam lived thirty years and nine hundred
years,&quot; as Aquila also agrees. Here the seventy-two translators, being
Hebrews and having been carefully instructed from early youth in the language of
the Hebrews as well as that of the Greeks, did not merely translate the Hebrew
writing into the Greek, but also, translating with insight, they retained the
expression that was uttered twice among the Hebrews; but, instead of the word
&quot;year&quot; being employed in two places, they used it in but one. What was
considered lameness they changed to smoothness when [they said, &quot;And Adam
lived] nine hundred and thirty years,&quot; where, moreover, they did not
eliminate {47d} a single word. But they also handed down accurately <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
a reading which in the Hebrew cannot be expressed as concisely as when the
seventy-two say, &quot;Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years.&quot; But it is
not thus in the Greek, so that Aquila translated superficially,<sup> </sup>saying,
&quot;Adam lived nine hundred years and thirty years.&quot; For <A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A>
behold, O lover of learning,<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> that it does not
give smoothness to the sentence, having regard not to clearness of expression
but to the exactness of the repetition of the word. Now this seems to some to be
an omission made by the seventy-two, while by Aquila and Symmachus and other
translators it is translated without any omission. However, there has been no
(real) omission by the seventy-two. But, moreover, by the followers of Aquila,
with harshness of sound the word is superfluously used in two places instead of
one, that is, instead of &quot;years,&quot; &quot;year&quot; and
&quot;year.&quot; <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> Therefore the seventy-two
omitted the word &quot;year&quot; in one place. {48a} But when the followers of
Aquila came later and filled in the things that had been omitted by the
seventy-two, they seemed altogether superfluous. And Origen, coming after them,
restored the word that was lacking in every place, but placed the asterisk by
it. Not that the word was of necessity required in all cases ----for it was
superfluous----but because he would not permit the Jews and Samaritans to find
fault with the divine Scriptures in the holy churches, since there is nothing in
the words with asterisks disparaging to the faith; for they are (merely)
superfluous and repetitious, as we see by reading in the case of Adam and his
life, since even from the shorter sentence you are also able to insert the other
words by which the asterisks have been placed. But that you may know also why he
placed the asterisk {48b} by these words, without malice we have said this also.
You know, O reader, that there are stars in the firmament of heaven, even if
they are obscured by clouds or the sun. It was with this thought that he acted
when he placed the asterisks, that he might show you that the words to which the
asterisks are attached are fixed in the Hebrew Scriptures like the stars in the
firmament of heaven, but that they have been obscured by the translation of the
seventy-two as the stars are obscured by the clouds. This is the significance of
the asterisk.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;As to the story of the obelus, it goes this way. The obelus is that which
is made - , for it is written in the form of what is called the line. But
according to Attic usage obelus means spear,<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> that
is, lance. And <A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A> in the divine
Scriptures it is placed by those words which are used by the seventy-two
translators but do not occur among the followers of Aquila or Symmachus. For the
{48c} seventy-two translators added these words of themselves, not uselessly
but, rather, helpfully. For where they added words lacking in these (other
versions), they gave clearness to the reading, so that we regard them as not
disassociated from the Holy Spirit. For they omitted those that had no need of
repetition; but where there was a word that was considered ambiguous when
translated into the Greek language, there they made an addition. This may be
surprising, but we should not be rash to bring censure, but rather praise that
it is according to the will of God that what is sacred should be understood. For
while they were seventy-two in number and on the Pharian island, but called
Anoge,<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> opposite Alexandria, they were in
thirty-six cells, two in each cell. From morning to evening they were shut up,
and in the evening they would cross over in thirty-six small boats and go again
to the palace of Ptolemy Philadelphus and dine with him.<sup><A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
</sup>{48d} And each pair slept in (one of) thirty-six bedchambers, so that they
might not talk with one another, but might produce an unadulterated translation.
Thus they conducted themselves. For, having constructed the thirty-six cells
already mentioned, over on the island, and formed them into pairs, Ptolemy shut
them up in them two by two, as I have said. And with them he shut up two youths
to minister to them in preparing food and (in other) service, and also skilled <A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
scribes. Moreover, he had made no opening into these cells through the walls,
but in the roof above he opened what are called roof windows. But while thus
abiding from morning to evening shut in by locks, they were translating as
follows. To every pair one book was given. That is to say, the book of the
Genesis of the Avorld to one pair, the Exodus of the Israelites to another pair,
that of Leviticus to another, and the next book in order to the next; and thus
were translated the twenty-seven {49a} recognized canonical books, but
twenty-two when counted according to the letters of the alphabet of the Hebrews.
<A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;For the names of the letters are twenty-two. But there are five of them
that have a double form, for <i>k </i>has a double form, and m and <i>n </i>and <i>p
</i>and <i>s</i>.<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> Therefore in this manner the
books also are counted as twenty-two; but there are twenty-seven, because five
of them are double. For Ruth is joined to Judges, and they are counted among the
Hebrews (as) one book. The first (book) of Kingdoms <A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
is joined to the second and called one book; the third is joined to the fourth
and becomes one book. First Paraleipomena is joined to Second and called one
book. The first book of Ezra is joined to the second and becomes one book.<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
So in this way the books are grouped into four &quot;pentateuchs,&quot; and
there are two others left over, so that the books of the (Old) Testament are as
follows: the five of the Law---- {49b} Genesis,<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy----this is the Pentateuch,
otherwise the code of law; and five in verse----the book of Job, then of the
Psalms, the Proverbs of Solomon, Koheleth, the Song of Songs. Then another
&quot;pentateuch&quot; (of books) which are called the Writings, and by some the
Hagiographa, which are as follows: Joshua the (son) of Nun, the book of Judges
with Ruth, First and Second Paraleipomena, First and Second Kingdoms, Third and
Fourth Kingdoms; and this is a third &quot;pentateuch.&quot; Another
&quot;pentateuch&quot; is the books of the prophets----the Twelve Prophets
(forming) one <sup><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> </sup>book,<sup><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></sup>
Isaiah one,<sup><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></sup> Jeremiah one,<sup><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></sup>
Ezekiel one,<sup><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></sup> Daniel one <sup><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></sup>----and
again the prophetic &quot;pentateuch&quot; is filled up.<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
But there remain two other books, which are (one of them) the two<sup>30</sup>
of Ezra that are counted as one, and the other the book of Esther. So twenty-two
books are completed according to the number of the twenty-two {49c} letters of
the Hebrews. For there are two (other) poetical books, that by Solomon called
&quot;Most Excellent,&quot; <A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A> and that by Jesus
the son of Sirach and grandson of Jesus----<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A><sup> </sup>for
his grandfather was named Jesus <A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A><sup> </sup>(and
was) he who composed Wisdom in Hebrew, which his grandson, <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
translating, wrote in Greek----which also are helpful and useful, but are not
included in the number of the recognized; and therefore they were not <A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
kept in the chest, that is, in the ark of the covenant.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;But, further, this also should not escape you, O lover of the good,
that the Hebrews have also divided the book of Psalms into five books, so that
it is yet another &quot;pentateuch.&quot; For from the first Psalm to the
fortieth they reckon one book, and from the forty-first to the seventy-first
they reckon a second; from the seventy-second to the eighty-eighth they make the
third book; for the eighty-ninth to the one hundred fifth they make the fourth;
from the {49d} one hundred sixth to the one hundred fiftieth they unite into the
fifth. For every Psalm that had as its conclusion, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, so
be it, so be it,&quot; they thought to be appropriately the end of a book. And
this is found in the fortieth and in the seventy-first and in the eighty-eighth
and in the one hundred fifth, <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A><sup> </sup>and
(thus) the four books are completed.<A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> But the
conclusion of the fifth book, instead of the &quot;Blessed be the Lord, so be
it, so be it,&quot; is &quot;Let everything that breathes praise the Lord!
Hallelujah!&quot; For when they thus reckoned they thereby completed the whole
matter.<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A> Thus they are twenty-seven; but they are
counted as twenty-two, even with the book of Psalms and those by Jeremiah----I
mean Lamentations and the epistles of Baruch <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>and of Jeremiah,<A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> although the epistles are
not in use among the Hebrews, but only Lamentations, which is joined to
Jeremiah. In the way we have related they were translated. They were given to
every pair {50a} of translators in rotation, and again from the first pair to
the second, and from the second pair to the third; and thus they went, every one
going around.<sup>37</sup> And they were translated thirty-six times, as the
story goes,<A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A> both the twenty-two <A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>and the seventy-two <A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> that are apocryphal.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;And when they were completed, the king sat on a lofty throne; and
thirty-six readers <A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A><sup> </sup>also sat below,<A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
holding thirty-six duplicates <A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A> of
each book, and one had a copy of the Hebrew Scriptures. Each reader read alone,
and the others kept watch. No <A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A> disagreement was
found, but it was such an amazing work of God that it was recognized that these
men possessed the gift of the Holy Spirit, because they agreed in translation.
And wherever they had added a word all of them had added the same, and where
they had made an omission all alike had made the omission. And there was no need
for the omitted words, but for those they added <A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
there {50b} was need. But that what is said may be clear to you, how
marvelously, under the guidance of God and in the harmony of the Holy Spirit,
they translated harmoniously and were not at variance with one another, in order
that thereby knowing and being assured you may agree with our statement, I shall
give you a demonstration of these things by means of a brief quotation.<sup>43</sup>
In the one hundred fortieth Psalm it is put in the Hebrew thus: <i>&deg;dhonj 'lkh
qrjth, sm' 'jlj, 'bhjt' 'qol, </i><A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A><i> </i>which
is, being translated, &quot;O Lord, I have cried unto thee; answer me; consider
the voice.&quot; But the Hebrew does not have &quot;of my request.&quot; <A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
Behold, then, how lame it is found to be! So the seventy-two translators, when
they added &quot;of my request,&quot; made the line unhalting and translated:
&quot;O Lord, I have cried unto thee; answer me; consider the voice of my
request.&quot; And behold in what beautiful style the psalm is (now) chanted!
Understand then, from this very brief statement, the similar things {50c}
inserted by these translators everywhere in the additions, for the words are
well added in explanation <A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A> and for the advantage
of the peoples about to be called to the faith of God and the obtaining of the
inheritance of life from the divine words of the Old Testament and the New.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>7.</SPAN>&nbsp;And in the same way also, Origen, doing well in making use of the
asterisk, likewise also made use of the obelus as a symbol. Oh that he had done
the other things as well! For when he had placed the six translations and the
Hebrew writing, in Hebrew letters and words, in one column (each), he placed
another column over against the latter, <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A>
in Greek letters but in Hebrew words, for the comprehension of those
unacquainted with the Hebrew letters, so that by means of the Greek they might
know the force of the Hebrew words. And so, in the <i>Hexapla </i>or <i>Octapla,
</i>which is <A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A> by him, where the two columns {50d}
of Hebrew and the six translations he set in order side by side, he has
contributed to the lovers of the good a great increment of knowledge. If only in
his discourses he had not erred, bringing harm to the world and to himself, when
he taught wrongly the things pertaining to the faith and explained most of the
Scriptures in an unorthodox manner. But I will take up the account of the obelus
again.<A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A> Now we have said that obelus means lance,
but the sword is the destructive one.<A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Where
therefore the word is found to be used by the seventy-two but does not occur in
the Hebrew, by the sign of the obelus placed beside the word it is known that
the word is to be lifted up <A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A> from the native
place, that is to say, from the soil of the Scriptures, as something that is not
in the place in the Hebrew Scripture. And I have explained the things pertaining
to the asterisk and the obelus.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>8.</SPAN>&nbsp;<A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Concerning the <i>lemniscus.</i><A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A><i>
</i>But I must tell the things pertaining to the <i>lemniscus </i>&divide;
and the <i>hypolemniscus </i>@ . {51a}The <i>lemniscus, </i>as the sign is here
placed, is that which is written &divide;. It is a line between
two dots, that is to say, points, one being above and one below. And it is found
among physicians in physiology, and gets its name from surgery upon the body.
When (the flesh) is separated, that is to say, cut apart, by two straight cuts,
then in the middle of the two divisions of the cut place, because of the
cuttings,<A HREF="#65"><SUP>65</SUP></A> each one straight, the figure of the
obelus is completed on the body. But when the dressing <A HREF="#66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>----
which is a piece of linen cut off in a form long and narrow----is applied on one
side of the cut and crosses to the other, it is well called by physicians the <i>lemniscus,
</i>because of the overflowing (pools) when the <A NAME="p23"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|23</SPAN></A>
dressing is flooded by the discharge from the place.<A HREF="#67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>
Therefore this kind of sign also they attach to the divine words, that when
{51b} there is found in rare instances in the translation of the seventy-two a
dissonant word, neither subtracted from nor added to words similar to it, you
may know, because of the two points placed by it, that this word was translated
by one or two pairs. But they were read in two ways or similarly. And that this
also may be clear to you and easy to understand, I would also say concerning it:
When you find that it is said<sup> </sup><A HREF="#68"><SUP>68</SUP></A> in
Psalm 70, &quot;My mouth proclaims thy righteousness,&quot; <A HREF="#69"><sup>69</sup></A><sup>
</sup><A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A><sup> </sup>instead of &quot;proclaims thy
righteousness&quot;<sup> </sup><A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A> is
&quot;proclaims thy righteousnesses.&quot; And again in Psalm 71 <A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>it says,<A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A> &quot;And their <A HREF="#71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>
name is honored before him&quot;;<A HREF="#72"><SUP>72</SUP></A> but instead of
this it is put, &quot;And their <A HREF="#71"><SUP>71</SUP></A> name is honored
in his eyes.&quot; And so you may find it in many places, where there is nothing
taken away or changed but it is the very same (in meaning), though expressed
differently, so that it is not foreign to the others;<A HREF="#73"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
they are read both ways. And they are so {51c} indicated by the <i>lemniscus </i>when
a word is found thus employed by one or two pairs. Now we have explained
sufficiently <A HREF="#74"><SUP>74</SUP></A> the things concerning the <i>lemniscus.
</i>In like manner also we make explanation concerning the <i>hypolemniscus, </i>so
that if you find the sign written ----, which is a simple line having the form
of the obelus, with a dot, that is to say, a point, under it, you may know that
it is a sign indicating the symbol of the <i>hypolemniscus. </i>Where now it is
found placed by a word, it is indicated that by one pair of translators the word
was omitted <A HREF="#75"><SUP>75</SUP></A><sup> </sup>in the place,<A HREF="#75"><SUP>75</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>as the single dot indicates, and there is also a double or consonant <A HREF="#76"><sup>76</sup></A><sup>
</sup>reading of the word by which it is placed. This is our <A HREF="#77"><SUP>77</SUP></A>
explanation of the asterisk, the obelus, the <i>lemniscus, </i>and the <i>hypolemniscus,
</i>O lover of the good.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>9.</SPAN>&nbsp;And it is well for us also to explain the matter of the translators. For a
knowledge of them will be helpful to you, since {51d} by the inclusion <A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A>
of their story it will be seen who and whence <A HREF="#78"><SUP>78</SUP></A>
and of what race each of them was, and what was the cause of their <A HREF="#79"><SUP>79</SUP></A>
translating. And the first translators <A HREF="#80"><SUP>80</SUP></A> of the
divine Scriptures from the Hebrew language into the Greek were seventy-two men
in number, those who made the first translation in the days of Ptolemy
Philadelphus. They were chosen from the twelve tribes of Israel, six men from
each tribe, as Aristeas has transmitted it in his work.<A HREF="#81"><SUP>81</SUP></A>
And their names are these:<A HREF="#82"><SUP>82</SUP></A> first, from the tribe
of Reuben, Josephus, Hezekiah, Zechariah, Johanan, Hezekiah, Elisha; second,
from the tribe of Simeon, Judah, Simeon, Samuel, Addai, Mattathias, Shalmai
(Eschlemias); third, from the tribe of Levi, Nehemiah, Joseph, Theodosius, Base
(Basaios),<A HREF="#83"><SUP>83</SUP></A> Ornias, Dakis; fourth, from the tribe
of Judah, Jonathan, Abraios, Elisha, Hananiah, Zechariah,<A HREF="#84"><SUP>84</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>{52a} Hilkiah; fifth, from the tribe of Issachar, Isaac, Jacob, Joshua,
Sambat (Sabbataios), Simeon, Levi; sixth, from the tribe of Zebulun, Judah,
Joseph, Simeon, Zechariah, Samuel, Shalmai (Selemias); seventh, from the tribe
of Gad, Sambat (Sabbataios), Zedekiah, Jacob, Isaac, Jesse, Matthew (Natthaios);
eighth, from the tribe of Asher, Theodosius, Jason, Joshua, Theodotus, Johanan,
Jonathan; ninth, from the tribe of Dan, Theophilus, Abram, Arsamos, Jason,
Endemias, Daniel; tenth, from the tribe of Naphtali, Jeremiah, Eliezer,
Zechariah, Benaiah, Elisha, Dathaios; eleventh, from the tribe of Joseph,
Samuel, Josephus, Judah, Jonathan, Caleb (Chabeu), Dositheus; twelfth, from the
tribe of Benjamin, Isaelos, Johanan, Theodosius, Arsamos, Abitos (Abietes),
Ezekiel. These are the names, as we have already said, of the seventy-two
translators. We have told about the things concerning the asterisk and obelus
above, and in part about the other translators, that is, {52b} Aquila and
Symmachus and the rest; we will here inform you also of the causes, <A HREF="#85"><sup>85</sup></A><sup>
</sup>O lover of the good.<A HREF="#85"><sup>85</sup></A><sup>&nbsp;</sup> <A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A>
After the first Ptolemy, the second who reigned over Alexandria, the Ptolemy
called Philadelphus, as has already been said was a lover of the beautiful and a
lover of learning. He established a library in the same city of Alexander,<A HREF="#86"><SUP>86</SUP></A>
in the (part) called the Bruchion; this is a quarter of the city today lying
waste. And he put in charge of the library a certain Demetrius, from Phaleron,<A HREF="#87"><SUP>87</SUP></A>
commanding him to collect the books that were in every part of the world. And he
wrote letters and made request of every king and prince on earth to take the
trouble to send <A HREF="#85"><sup>85</sup></A><sup> </sup>those that were in
his kingdom or principality <A HREF="#85"><sup>85</sup></A>----I mean, those by
poets and prose writers and orators and philosophers and physicians and
professors of medicine and historians and books by any others. And after the
work had progressed {52c} and books had been collected from everywhere, one day
the king asked the man who had been placed in charge of the library how many
books had already been collected in the library. And he answered the king,
saying: &quot;There are already fifty-four thousand eight hundred books, more or
less; but we have heard that there is a great multitude in the world, among the
Cushites, the Indians, the Persians, the Elamites, the Babylonians, the
Assyrians, and the Chaldeans, and among the Romans, the Phoenicians, the
Syrians, and the Romans in Greece&quot;----at that time called not Romans but
Latins.<A HREF="#88"><SUP>88</SUP></A> &quot;But there are also with those in
Jerusalem and Judah the divine Scriptures of the prophets, which tell about God
and the creation of the world and every other doctrine of general value. If,
therefore, it seem good to your majesty, O king, that we <A HREF="#89"><SUP>89</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>send (and) secure <A HREF="#89"><SUP>89</SUP></A> them also, write to the
teachers in Jerusalem and they will send them to you, that you may place these
books also in this library, your grace.&quot; <A HREF="#90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>
Thereupon {52d} the king wrote the letter, in these words: <A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <A HREF="#91"><SUP></SUP></a><SUP><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>10.</SPAN>&nbsp;91</SUP>The letter of the king to the teachers of
the Jews:<A HREF="#91"><SUP>91</SUP></A> &quot;King Ptolemy to the teachers of
the Jews in Jerusalem: Much joy. After I had established a library and collected
many books from every people and placed them in it, I heard that there are also
found among you the books of the prophets which tell about God and the creation
of the world. And, desiring that I might give them also a place of honor<A HREF="#92"><SUP>92</SUP></A>
with the other books, I have written that you may send them to us. For I am
honorably desirous of such a thing and devoid of guile or evil intention, but in
good faith and kindness toward you I make request for them, since <A HREF="#93"><SUP>93</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>from of old <A HREF="#93"><SUP>93</SUP></A> there has been good will from
us toward you, as you know when you remember. For perhaps you recall how, when
many captives had been taken from your place and brought to our place in Egypt,
I let them go. With abundance of provisions and exercising unusual consideration
toward them, I sent them away free.<A HREF="#94"><SUP>94</SUP></A> Moreover,
those who were sick among them, {53a} after I had healed them, I likewise
dismissed, and the naked I clothed. And now a table of gold, embellished with
precious stones of great value, a hundred talents in weight, instead of the
table that was taken from the holy place (of) Jerusalem, I have sent along, with
gifts and valuable things for the priestly place. I have thus given a recital of
these things that you may know that I have requested the books because of a vow
of piety.&quot; <A HREF="#95"><SUP>95</SUP></A> And the letter was dispatched
and the presents sent likewise.<A HREF="#96"><SUP>96</SUP></A> And when they had
received and read <A HREF="#96"><SUP>96</SUP></A> the letter and <A HREF="#97"><SUP>97</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>saw the things that had been sent,<A HREF="#97"><SUP>97</SUP></A> they had
great joy and without delay transcribed the books in Hebrew letters of gold.
They sent those recounted <A HREF="#98"><SUP>98</SUP></A> by me above, the
twenty-two of the (Old) Testament and the seventy-two that are apocryphal. But
when the king picked them up and looked at them and was unable to read them,
because they were written in Hebrew letters and in the Hebrew <A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
language, it was necessary for them to write a second letter {53b} and request
translators who would be able to explain to him in the Greek language the things
in the Hebrew.<A HREF="#99"><SUP>99</SUP></A> The letter was as follows:<A HREF="#100"><SUP>100</SUP></A></p>
<p> <A HREF="#101"><SUP></SUP></a><SUP><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>11.</SPAN>&nbsp;101</SUP>The second letter:<A HREF="#101"><SUP>101</SUP></A>
&quot;King Ptolemy to the teachers of religion in Jerusalem: Much joy. As to the
hid treasure and the sealed fountain, what profit is there in either of them?<A HREF="#102"><SUP>102</SUP></A>
Likewise also is the matter of the books sent to us by you; for since we are
unable to read these sent to us by you, such a thing is for us of no use
whatever. But consent to send us as translators such of your men as from youth
have been specially trained in the language of both the Hebrews and the
Greeks.&quot; Thereupon the seventy-two translators <A HREF="#103"><SUP>103</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>above mentioned <A HREF="#103"><SUP>103</SUP></A><sup> </sup>the teachers
of the Hebrews chose and sent, according to the example that Moses once set when
he went up the mountain at the command of the Lord,<A HREF="#104"><SUP>104</SUP></A>
having heard: &quot;Take with thee seventy men and go up the mountain.&quot;<A HREF="#105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>
But for the sake of peace among the tribes, that he might not take five men from
some and six from others and create discord among the tribes, {53c} he made up
his mind rather to take seventy-two and to add to the number. And in this way,
as I have said, they also sent these men who translated the Scriptures on the
island called the Pharian (Pharos), as we have already said above, <A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>in
the way we have described.<A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A> And so the
Scriptures, when they had been transferred to the Greek language, were placed in
the first library, which was built in the Bruchion, <A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>as
I have already said.<A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A> And there arose in
addition to this library a second up in the Serapeum, called its daughter.<A HREF="#107"><SUP>107</SUP></A>
And the period of the ten Ptolemies and Cleopatra passed away, two hundred
fifty-nine years.<A HREF="#108"><SUP>108</SUP></A><sup>&nbsp; <A NAME="p28"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|28</SPAN></A></sup></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>12.</SPAN>&nbsp;After the first Ptolemy, he of the Rabbit (Lagos), who reigned
forty years, <A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A><sup> </sup>and after the seventh
year of the second Ptolemy, who is also (named) Philadelphus, the number of the
Ptolemies and of the years is as follows:<A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>
Ptolemy Philadelphus, thirty-eight years; in his days, in his seventh year more
or less, the seventy-two translators above mentioned translated the Scriptures.<A HREF="#109"><SUP>109</SUP></A>
And after the time of their translation of the Scriptures the years and the
kings are as follows: Ptolemy Philadelphus, already {53d} mentioned, the rest of
his years, thirty-one;<A HREF="#110"><SUP>110</SUP></A> Ptolemy the Well-Doer
(Euergetes), twenty-four years; Ptolemy Philopator, twenty-one years; Ptolemy
Epiphanes, twenty-two years; Ptolemy Philometor,<A HREF="#111"><SUP>111</SUP></A>
thirty-four years; Ptolemy the Lover of Learning and the Well-Doer (Philologus
and Euergetes), twenty-nine years; Ptolemy the Savior (Soter), fifteen years;
Ptolemy, who is also Alexas, twelve years; Ptolemy, the brother of Alexas, who
was driven out by his mother, eight years; Ptolemy Dionysius, thirty-one years;
Cleopatra, the daughter of Ptolemy, thirty-two years.<sup><A HREF="#112"><SUP>112</SUP></A>
</sup>She formed a union with Antoninus (Antony) the king, who is also (called)
&quot;Eight Sons.&quot; Altogether two hundred fifty-nine years, according to
what is set down above.<A HREF="#113"><SUP>113</SUP></A> Then ceased the Rabbity
(Lagid) kings, the Ptolemies, who were <A HREF="#114"><SUP>114</SUP></A>
descended from the Rabbit (Lagos), for whom the race course, when built in
Alexandria, was called only in the same Alexandria the Rabbity.<A HREF="#115"><SUP>115</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>13.</SPAN>&nbsp;Afterward the kings of the Romans:<A HREF="#116"><SUP>116</SUP></A>
Augustus, fifty-six years <A HREF="#117"><SUP>117</SUP></A><sup> </sup>and six
months.<A HREF="#117"><SUP>117</SUP></A> In the forty-second year of the days of
this <A NAME="p29"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|29</SPAN></A> Augustus <A HREF="#118"><SUP>118</SUP></A>
our Lord Jesus Christ was born in the flesh. Tiberius, twenty-three years. {54a}
And in his eighteenth year Christ was crucified <A HREF="#117"><SUP>117</SUP></A>of
his own free will. And from the crucifixion to the destruction of Jerusalem the
years are as follows: the rest of Tiberius, five years;<A HREF="#117"><SUP>117</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>Gaius, three years and nine months and twenty-nine days; Claudius,
thirteen years and one month and twenty-eight days; Nero, thirteen years and
seven months and twenty-seven days; Galba, seven months and twenty-six days;
Otho, three months and five days; Vitellius, eight <A HREF="#119"><SUP>119</SUP></A>
months and twelve days; Vespasian, nine years and seven months and twelve days;
Titus, two years and two months and two days. At this time occurred the
destruction of Jerusalem, fifty years after Christ was crucified, lacking three
months.<A HREF="#120"><SUP>120</SUP></A> Domitian, fifteen years and five
months; Nerva, one year and four months; Trajan, nineteen years; Hadrian,
twenty-one years.</p>
<p><A HREF="#121"><SUP>121</SUP></A>Concerning Aquila.<A HREF="#121"><SUP>121</SUP></A>
In the twelfth year of Hadrian Aquila became known. And again from Augustine to
Hadrian is one hundred eighty years<A HREF="#122"><SUP>122</SUP></A> and four
months, lacking nine days. So from the time of the translation {54b} by the
seventy-two translators to the translator Aquila and the twelfth year of Hadrian
is altogether four hundred thirty years and four months, <A HREF="#123"><SUP>123</SUP></A>lacking
nine days;<A HREF="#123"><SUP>123</SUP></A> and to the end of the entire (reign)
of Hadrian four hundred thirty-nine years and four months, lacking nine days.<A HREF="#124"><SUP>124</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>14.</SPAN>&nbsp;For this Hadrian, when leprosy<A HREF="#125"><SUP>125</SUP></A> appeared
in his body and he had summoned the whole multitude of the physicians under his
dominion before him, demanded of them healing for his body. And when they had
labored much <A HREF="#126"><SUP>126</SUP></A>and done many things<A HREF="#126"><SUP>126</SUP></A>
and availed nothing, they were scorned by him. He <A HREF="#127"><SUP>127</SUP></A>
wrote an abusive letter concerning <A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A>
them, assailing<A HREF="#128"><SUP>128</SUP></A> their art as devoid of
knowledge. But as a result of the illness<A HREF="#129"><SUP>129</SUP></A> that
befell him he went on a journey to the land of Egypt. And, approaching other
places<A HREF="#130"><SUP>130</SUP></A> in order from that of the Romans, he
must inspect them, for he was <sup>122</sup>a man who loved to see places. So he
passed through the city of Antioch and passed through [Coele-Syria]<A HREF="#131"><SUP>131</SUP></A>
and Phoenicia and came to Palestine---- {54c} which is also called Judea----forty-seven
years after the destruction of Jerusalem. And he went up to Jersualem, the
famous and illustrious city which Titus, the son of Vespasian, overthrew in the
second year of his reign.<A HREF="#132"><SUP>132</SUP></A> And he found the
temple of God trodden down and the whole city devastated save for a few houses
and the church of God, which was small, where the disciples, when they had
returned after the Savior had ascended from the Mount of Olives, went to the
upper room. For there it had been built, that is, in that portion of Zion which
escaped destruction, together with blocks of houses in the neighborhood of Zion
and the seven synagogues which alone remained standing in Zion, like solitary
huts, one of which remained until the time of Maximona the bishop and
Constantine the king, &quot;like a booth in a vineyard,&quot;<A HREF="#133"><SUP>133</SUP></A>
as it is written. Therefore Hadrian made up his mind to (re)build the city, but
not the temple. And he took the Aquila mentioned above, who was a Greek
interpreter, <A HREF="#134"><SUP>134</SUP></A>since Hadrian also was a Greek<A HREF="#134"><SUP>134</SUP></A>----
{54d} now Aquila was related to the king by marriage and was from Sinope in
Pontus----and he established him there <A HREF="#135"><SUP>135</SUP></A>in
Jerusalem<A HREF="#135"><SUP>135</SUP></A> as overseer of the work of building
the city. And he gave to the city that was being built his own name and the
appellation of the royal title. For as he was named Aelius Hadrian, so he also
named the city Aelia.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>15.</SPAN>&nbsp;So Aquila, while he was in Jerusalem, also saw the disciples <A HREF="#136"><SUP>136</SUP></A>of
the disciples<A HREF="#136"><SUP>136</SUP></A> of the apostles flourishing in
the faith and working <A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A> great signs,
healings, and other miracles. For they were such as had come back from the city
of Pella to Jerusalem and were <A HREF="#137"><SUP>137</SUP></A>living there and<A HREF="#137"><SUP>137</SUP></A>
teaching. For when the city was about to be taken <A HREF="#137"><SUP>137</SUP></A>and
destroyed<A HREF="#137"><SUP>137</SUP></A> by the Romans, it was revealed in
advance to all the disciples by an angel of God that they should remove from the
city, as it was going to be completely destroyed. They sojourned as emigrants in
Pella, the city above mentioned, {55a} in Transjordania. And this city is said
to be of the Decapolis. But after the destruction of Jerusalem, when they had
returned <A HREF="#138"><SUP>138</SUP></A>to Jerusalem,<A HREF="#138"><SUP>138</SUP></A>
as I have said, they wrought great signs, <A HREF="#138"><SUP>138</SUP></A>as I
have already said.<A HREF="#138"><SUP>138</SUP></A> So Aquila, after he had been
strongly stirred in mind, believed in Christianity, and after a while, when he
asked, he received the seal in Christ.<A HREF="#139"><SUP>139</SUP></A> But
according to his former habit,<A HREF="#140"><SUP>140</SUP></A> while yet
thinking the things of the heathen, he had been thoroughly trained in vain
astronomy, so that also after he became a Christian he never departed from this
fault of his, but every day he made calculations on the horoscope of his birth.
He was reproved by the teachers, and they rebuked him for this <A HREF="#141"><SUP>141</SUP></A>every
day<A HREF="#141"><SUP>141</SUP></A><sup> </sup>but did not accomplish anything.
But instead of standing rebuked, he became bold in disputation and tried to
establish things that have no existence, tales about fate. Hence, as one who
proved useless and could not be saved, he was expelled from {55b} the church.
But as one who had become embittered in mind over how he had suffered dishonor,
he was puffed up with vain jealousy, and having cursed<A HREF="#142"><SUP>142</SUP></A>
Christianity and renounced his life he became a proselyte<A HREF="#143"><SUP>143</SUP></A>
and was circumcised as a Jew. And, being painfully ambitious, he dedicated
himself to learning the language of the Hebrews and their writings. After he had
first been thoroughly trained for it, he made his translation. He was moved not
by the right motive, but (by the desire) so to distort certain of the words
occurring in the translation of the seventy-two that he might proclaim the
things testified to about Christ in the divine Scriptures <A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A>
to be fulfilled in some other way, on account of a certain shame that he felt
(to proffer) a senseless excuse for himself.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>16.</SPAN>&nbsp;And this second translation by Aquila <A HREF="#144"><SUP>144</SUP></A>
came about after such a (long) time as this, the number of the years of which we
have written above. But we must say, beloved, the words of it are incorrect <A HREF="#145"><SUP>145</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>and perversely translated,<A HREF="#145"><SUP>145</SUP></A> (words) which
carry condemnation for him in the very translation which he made. But having
explained the differences between them above, we think that that will suffice
here also.</p>
<p>But after this Aquila and his translation {55c} Antoninus, surnamed Pius----
translated, &quot;devout&quot;----succeeded King Hadrian and reigned for a
period of twenty-two years. Caracalla,<A HREF="#146"><SUP>146</SUP></A> who is
also called Geta,<A HREF="#147"><SUP>147</SUP></A><sup> </sup>also Marcus
Aurelius Verus, succeeded him and reigned seven years. In his time Lucius
Aurelius Commodus also reigned the same seven years.<A HREF="#148"><SUP>148</SUP></A>
Pertinax (reigned) six months, Severus eighteen<A HREF="#149"><SUP>149</SUP></A>
years.</p>
<p><A HREF="#150"><SUP>150</SUP></A>Concerning Symmachus.<A HREF="#150"><SUP>150</SUP></A>
In the time of Verus<A HREF="#151"><SUP>151</SUP></A> there was a certain
Symmachus, a Samaritan, of their wise men, but unhonored by his own people. He
was afflicted with the lust for power and became angry with his tribe. He
approached the Jews, became a proselyte,<A HREF="#152"><SUP>152</SUP></A> and
was circumcised a second time. Do not be surprised at this, O hearer, for it
occurred. For all who fled from the Jews to the Samaritans were likewise<A HREF="#153"><SUP>153</SUP></A>
circumcised again; likewise also those who came from the Samaritans to the Jews
did the same.<A HREF="#154"><SUP>154</SUP></A> And, moreover, what is even more
difficult than these things, some of the circumcised became uncircumcised. By a
certain operation {55d} of the medical art, by means of a knife called <A HREF="#155"><SUP>155</SUP></A>
the <i>spathistaros, </i>the inner skin of the organ having been cut loose and
sewed together and bound in place by adhesive medicaments, they again complete
foreskins for them. You have also the testimony of the holy apostle, O great
lover <A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A> of the good, speaking in such
words as these: &quot;If a circumcised man be called, let him not change to a
foreskin; if a man be in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised.&quot;<A HREF="#156"><SUP>156</SUP></A>
This tradition of a demoniacally wicked notion they say that Esau, the brother
of Jacob, invented for the denial of the Godhead and the obliteration of the
characteristic mark of his fathers. Therefore they say that God said: &quot;Esau
I have hated, but I have loved Jacob.&quot;<A HREF="#157"><SUP>157</SUP></A> So
this Symmachus, translating in order to pervert the translation current among
the Samaritans, published the third translation.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>17.</SPAN>&nbsp;<A HREF="#158"><SUP>158</SUP></A>Concerning Theodotion, who was from
Pontus.<A HREF="#158"><SUP>158</SUP></A> But after this, in the time immediately
following, that is, <A HREF="#159"><SUP>159</SUP></A>in the reign of Commodus----I
mean, of Commodus {56a} II----there was a certain Theodotion<A HREF="#159"><SUP>159</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>of Pontus, of the doctrine<A HREF="#160"><SUP>160</SUP></A> of Marcion,
the heresiarch of Sinope. Having become angered<A HREF="#161"><SUP>161</SUP></A>
with his heresy, he turned aside to Judaism and was circumcised and learned the
language of the Hebrews and their writings; he also published (a translation) on
his own account. He published many things in agreement with the seventy-two, for
he derived many (peculiar) practices from the translational habit(s) of the
seventy-two. Now you become the judge, O great lover of the good, of such a
matter as this, whether the truth is more likely to be found with these three----I
mean Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion ----who, moreover, were not together, but
were remote from one another in both time and place; and there were not many,
but only three, and yet they were unable to agree with one another. Or (was the
truth) with the seventy-two, who were the first to translate, were at the same
time, and were divided into thirty-six groups, according to the command of the
king? And, furthermore, they did not converse with one another, {56b} but by the
Holy Spirit they brought out the entire translation in absolute agreement; and
where there was need for an addition in explanation of a word, it was the same
among them all. Though they did not know what each one by himself was
translating, <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A> they agreed absolutely
with one another, and the translations were identical. And where they cast out
words, they translated in agreement with one another.<A HREF="#162"><SUP>162</SUP></A>
So it is clear to those who through love of the truth seek to investigate that
they were not merely translators but also, in part, prophets.<A HREF="#163"><SUP>163</SUP></A>
For the things for which there was no need they left out of the translation----the
things which Origen later inserted in their places, with the asterisks. Likewise
also those that had been added he did not take away, knowing rather that there
was need of them, but wherever he found one of these words employed he left it
with an obelus, merely indicating by the obelus his knowledge about the reading
of the passage. And by means of the <i>lemniscus </i>and the <i>hypolemniscus </i>he
likewise indicated such (passages) as were found in two ways among some of the
seventy-two translators {56c} in a few passages that are not unlike, but similar
and having the same significance, as if a man should say &quot;he
conversed&quot; instead of &quot;he spoke,&quot; or &quot;he has come&quot;
instead of &quot;he came.&quot; And we have written for you the facts concerning
the four translators.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C18"></A>18.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the fifth and sixth translations, which were found in wine
jars in Jericho after the persecution of Verus, in the time of Antoninus, who is
called Caracalla and Geta.<A HREF="#164"><SUP>164</SUP></A> But as to the fifth
and sixth translations, I have nothing to say as to those who translated them or
whence they were, but only that after the persecution of King Verus,<A HREF="#165"><SUP>165</SUP></A>
in the time of Antoninus,<A HREF="#166"><SUP>166</SUP></A> son of Severus, who
is called Caracalla, also Geta,<A HREF="#167"><SUP>167</SUP></A> the fifth was
found in Jericho, hidden in wine jars.<A HREF="#168"><SUP>168</SUP></A> For as
to the time of those who reigned after Antoninus Pius----translated,
&quot;devout&quot;----the succession, in order, is : {56d} After Antoninus <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A>
Pius reigned Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, otherwise Verus, nineteen <sup><A HREF="#169">169</A>
</sup>years. And the same man is called Commodus Lucius.<A HREF="#170"><SUP>170</SUP></A>
In his time, as I have already said, Symmachus the translator became known.<A HREF="#171"><SUP>171</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>After him Commodus II reigned thirteen years. At this time we have learned<A HREF="#172"><SUP>172</SUP></A>
that Theodotion became known, he who <A HREF="#173"><SUP>173</SUP></A><sup> </sup>became
a Jew, (going) from the Marcionites, and<A HREF="#173"><SUP>173</SUP></A> made
the fourth translation. And Pertinax succeeded Commodus<A HREF="#174"><SUP>174</SUP></A>
and reigned six months. Severus<A HREF="#175"><SUP>175</SUP></A> succeeded him
and reigned with his son Antoninus, otherwise Geta, eighteen years.<A HREF="#176"><SUP>176</SUP></A>
And when Severus died, his son Antoninus Geta<A HREF="#177"><SUP>177</SUP></A>
inherited his sovereignty, he that is called Caracalla, and he served seven
years. In his days,<A HREF="#178"><SUP>178</SUP></A> as I have said above,<A HREF="#179"><SUP>179</SUP></A>
were found the Scriptures in the fifth translation, hidden in wine jars in
Jericho with other Hebrew books and other books.<A HREF="#180"><SUP>180</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>{57a} Macrinus succeeded Caracalla and reigned one year.<A HREF="#181"><SUP>181</SUP></A>
Antoninus II succeeded him,<A HREF="#182"><SUP>182</SUP></A> reigning four
years. After him reigned Alexander, the son of Mammaea,<A HREF="#183"><SUP>183</SUP></A>
thirteen years. In the midst of these times the sixth translation was found,
also hidden in wine jars, in Nicopolis, near Actium. After him Maximian reigned
three years. Gordian succeeded him and reigned six years. After him Philip
reigned seven years. Decius succeeded him and reigned one year and three months.
In the time of Decius Origen became known, flourishing from the time of Decius
through the days of Gallienus<A HREF="#184"><SUP>184</SUP></A> and Volusianus
and beyond.<A HREF="#185"><SUP>185</SUP></A> <A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>&nbsp;</SPAN>
But in the persecution that took place under Decius, <A HREF="#186"><SUP>186</SUP></A>already
mentioned,<A HREF="#186"><SUP>186</SUP></A> Babylas suffered martyrdom in
Antioch, Flavianus in Rome, and Alexander, the bishop of Jerusalem, in Caesarea.
<A HREF="#187"><SUP>187</SUP></A>In this time of persecution,<A HREF="#187"><SUP>187</SUP></A>
while Origen himself suffered many things of the heathen in Alexandria, {57b} <A HREF="#188"><SUP>188</SUP></A>he
who is also called Adamantius,<A HREF="#188"><SUP>188</SUP></A> he did not
attain the goal of martyrdom. But when he had come to Caesarea Stratonitis and
had dwelt a little while in Jerusalem, he afterward went to Tyre. Twenty-eight
years, as the story goes, he devoted to ascetic practices, and he set forth<A HREF="#189"><SUP>189</SUP></A>
the Scripture, placing the six columns (of the Greek) and the two columns of the
Hebrew side by side, one translation alongside another, calling the books the <i>Hexapla,
</i>as has already been fully related by me above.<A HREF="#190"><SUP>190</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C19"></A>19.</SPAN>&nbsp;But when the fifth and sixth translations of the Scriptures were found in
the manner we have related and no one knew who they were who had translated
them, according to the time when they were found he (Origen) attached<A HREF="#191"><SUP>191</SUP></A>
them to the four earlier ones successively in the series. He called one the
fifth, writing over it, by means of the fifth letter, the number five and giving
it a name. Likewise also to the one {57c} after it, writing a letter above it as
a symbol,<A HREF="#192"><SUP>192</SUP></A> he gave the name of the sixth
translation. But, moreover, he did this skilfully, a thing that has escaped some
of the lovers of learning. For when people happen upon the <i>Hexapla </i>or <i>Octapla</i>----for
the Greek (columns) are a <i>tetrapla </i>when the (translations) of Aquila,
Symmachus, the seventy-two, and Theodotion are placed together; but when these
four columns are joined to the two Hebrew columns they are called the <i>Hexapla,
</i>and when the fifth and sixth also are joined successively to these they are
called the <i>Octapla</i>----I mean, the six translations and the two others,
one written in Hebrew characters and in their own words, and the other in Greek
characters but with the Hebrew words<A HREF="#193"><SUP>193</SUP></A>----when
some <A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A> people, then, as I have said,
happen upon these books and find the first two columns {57d} of Hebrew placed
together, and after them that by Aquila placed first<A HREF="#194"><SUP>194</SUP></A>
and after it that by Symmachus, afterward that by the seventy-two and after it
that by Theodotion, grouped together, and afterward the fifth and sixth
(translations), they conclude that Aquila and Symmachus translated first.<A HREF="#195"><SUP>195</SUP></A>
But it is not so; but Origen, having learned that the translation of the
seventy-two was correct, placed it in the middle so that it might refute the
translations on either side. This one thing only Origen did helpfully. Now, that
we may not omit to give the succession of the kings of the Romans, which we
began, we will proceed to give in order the sequences of the other kings,
according as each of them reigned.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C20"></A>20.</SPAN>&nbsp;After Gallienus<A HREF="#196"><SUP>196</SUP></A> and Volusianus, already
mentioned, who reigned two years and four months, Valerian and Gallienus reigned
{58a} twelve years. In the ninth year of their reign Mani came up from Persia,
when he disputed with Archelaus, bishop of Kaschara in Mesopotamia, met defeat,
(and) fled secretly. For when he came to Diodoris,<A HREF="#197"><SUP>197</SUP></A>
a town under the authority of Kaschara, and disputed with the holy Tryphon,<A HREF="#198"><SUP>198</SUP></A>
the priest, he was completely humiliated before him. (And) when the holy
Archelaus heard that he had come to Tryphon and had held a disputation with him,
he came (and) met him and arranged a debate with Mani, and when he had
completely defeated him he put him to shame.<A HREF="#199"><SUP>199</SUP></A>
Thereupon Mani<A HREF="#200"><SUP>200</SUP></A> was about to die by stoning from
the people, but, having been saved by Bishop Archelaus, he returned to the
country of the Persians. The king of the Persians heard of his coming; and, when
he had sent and had him brought, he was ordered flayed by means of a reed.<A HREF="#201"><SUP>201</SUP></A>
And thus he returned (only) to end his life,<A HREF="#202"><SUP>202</SUP></A>
because he had committed murder and <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>
was unable to heal the demon-possessed son of the king {58b} as he had promised,
so the story has it. And after Valerian and Gallienus, Claudius reigned one year
and nine months. Aurelian succeeded him and reigned five years and six<A HREF="#203"><SUP>203</SUP></A>
months. After him Tacitus reigned six months.<A HREF="#204"><SUP>204</SUP></A>
After him Probus reigned six years and four months. After him Carus, with his
sons Carinus and Numerian, reigned two years. After him Diocletian, with
Maximian and Constantine <A HREF="#205"><SUP>205</SUP></A>and Maxentius, reigned<A HREF="#205"><SUP>205</SUP></A>
twenty<A HREF="#206"><SUP>206</SUP></A> years, <A HREF="#205"><SUP>205</SUP></A>declaring
Maxentius his colleague in the kingdom.<A HREF="#205"><SUP>205</SUP></A> In
their days there was a violent persecution, <A HREF="#207"><SUP>207</SUP></A>lasting
from the eighth year of Diocletian to his nineteenth year, twelve years taken
all together.<A HREF="#207"><SUP>207</SUP></A> And after the persecution ceased
Diocletian reigned one year more and, having become old,<sup> </sup>he ceased to
reign. {58c} But Maximian fell by a terrible death, with a disease of the eyes
and bodily suffering. His eyeballs were automatically torn out by the disease in
the very way he had appointed for the martyrs of Christ.<A HREF="#208"><SUP>208</SUP></A>
And thus he gave up the ghost, leaving Licinius and Constantine as rulers. And
from Diocletian onward the years of Maximian, of Licinius, and of the blessed
Constantine, who ruled with his sons, were thirty-two years. And he left his
three sons as rulers---- Constans, Constantine, and Constantius.<A HREF="#209"><SUP>209</SUP></A>
But after the thirty-two years of Constantine, the years of his sons who
succeeded him---- Constans, Constantine, and Constantius----(and) of the impious
Julian, of Jovian,<A HREF="#210"><SUP>210</SUP></A> <A HREF="#211"><SUP>211</SUP></A>of
Valentinian the Great, of Valens his brother, of Gratian the son of Valentinian,<A HREF="#211"><SUP>211</SUP></A>
of Valentinian the Younger, son <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A> of
Valentinian, brother<A HREF="#212"><SUP>212</SUP></A> of Gratian, of Theodosius
the God-fearing king, of Arcadius his son, and of Honorius the Illustrious, the
son {58d} of Theodosius,<A HREF="#213"><SUP>213</SUP></A> unto the present<A HREF="#214"><SUP>214</SUP></A>
second<A HREF="#215"><SUP>215</SUP></A> consulship of Arcadius Augustus<A HREF="#214"><SUP>214</SUP></A>
and Rufinus----the years, <A HREF="#216"><SUP>216</SUP></A>as I have said
before,<A HREF="#216"><SUP>216</SUP></A> are fifty-seven. And in the consulship
of Arcadius Augustus and Rufinus Valentinian the Younger died, being found
surprisingly hanged in the palace of Tiberius,<A HREF="#217"><SUP>217</SUP></A> <A HREF="#218"><SUP>218</SUP></A>as
the story is told,<A HREF="#218"><SUP>218</SUP></A> on the ides of May, on the
day before Pentecost, on the Sabbath day; and on the day of Pentecost itself he
was borne (to his grave). And so it was, according to the Egyptians, the
twenty-first day of the month Pachon, according to the Greeks the twenty-third
of 'Iyar, and according to the Romans the seventeenth day before the calends of
June.<A HREF="#219"><SUP>219</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C21"></A>21.</SPAN>&nbsp;And thus far, O great lover of the good, all these things related by us
must suffice; we have given<A HREF="#220"><SUP>220</SUP></A> an account of the
translators <A HREF="#221"><SUP>221</SUP></A>and of those things mentioned
before the subject of the translators.<A HREF="#221"><SUP>221</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Hereafter
we give our attention to the rest of the topics which we mentioned before,
according to our promise in response to your entreaties, O man of God,
concerning {59a} the weights and measures and numbers in the divine Scriptures,
whence each is named, and why it is so called, and whence it gets the reason for
its name, and what is the quality or the weight or the force of every one of
them.</p>
<p><A HREF="#222"><SUP>222</SUP></A>Concerning the measures.<A HREF="#222"><SUP>222</SUP></A>
The kor is a measure. It occurs in the Gospel of Luke, where the Savior commends
the sagacious steward who re-wrote<A HREF="#223"><SUP>223</SUP></A> for the
debtors instead of so many kors in <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A>
their accounts <A HREF="#224"><SUP>224</SUP></A> so and so, and instead of so
many baths of oil he made it so and so.<A HREF="#225"><SUP>225</SUP></A></p>
<p><i>Lethekh, saton,<A HREF="#226"><SUP>226</SUP></A> </i>homer, bath, seah, <i>modius,
</i>cab, <i>choinix, hyfi </i>of fine flour, handful of meal, ardeb, three
measures of fine flour, three baskets<A HREF="#227"><SUP>227</SUP></A> of coarse
meal, <i>nevel </i>of wine, <i>kollathon, shatifta </i>of ointment, <i>kapsakes </i>of
water, <i>kotyle </i>of oil, <i>kyathos, </i>measure of wine, measure of oil, <i>log</i>,
<A HREF="#228"><SUP>228</SUP></A><i> xestes, </i>amphora, <i>aporryma, sh<sup>e</sup>fitha,
</i>hin, <i>chus, </i>the golden pot {59b} in which the manna was placed, <i>mares,
kypros, congiarium.</i></p>
<p><A HREF="#229"><SUP>229</SUP></A>Concerning the kor.<A HREF="#229"><SUP>229</SUP></A>
<i>Kura </i>is taken from the Hebrew language, in which it is called
&quot;kor,&quot; and there are 30 <i>modii </i>(in it). The kor gets its name
from the fundamental idea of a heap, inasmuch as a heap is called a <i>karja,<A HREF="#230"><SUP>230</SUP></A>
</i>for when 30 <i>modii </i>are heaped together they make a camel's load.</p>
<p><A HREF="#231"><SUP>231</SUP></A>Conceming the <i>lethekh.</i><A HREF="#231"><SUP>231</SUP></A><i>
</i>But as to the <i>lethekh, </i>since it is said in the prophet Hosea, &quot;I
have hired for myself .... for a <i>lethekh </i>of barley,&quot;<A HREF="#232"><SUP>232</SUP></A>
in other codices &quot;a homer of barley,&quot; they are the same, for they
signify 15 <i>modii. </i>But the <i>lethekh </i>is named according to a word of
the Hebrews which means a &quot;lifting up,&quot;<A HREF="#233"><SUP>233</SUP></A>
from the circumstance that a young man can lift up the measure of 15 <i>modii </i>of
barley or wheat and place it on an ass. And the same (measure) of 15 <i>modii </i>is
also called the homer----the large one which is called the homer among the
Hebrews, for {59c} there is<A HREF="#234"><SUP>234</SUP></A> also a little
homer.</p>
<p><A HREF="#235"><SUP>235</SUP></A>Concerning the bath.<A HREF="#235"><SUP>235</SUP></A>
The bath, so called, is also from the Hebrew language, the oil press being
synonymously called <i>bith, </i>for bath is interpreted &quot;oil press.&quot;<A HREF="#236"><SUP>236</SUP></A>
It consists of 50 <i>xestai, </i>and is the <A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|41</SPAN></A>
measure of the craft of the oil press.<A HREF="#237"><SUP>237</SUP></A> The <i>m<sup>e</sup>nasis
</i>and the <i>medimnos </i>are taken, I think, from the language of the Romans,
for in that language <i>medium </i>is interpreted &quot;middle.&quot;<A HREF="#238"><SUP>238</SUP></A>
The <i>m<sup>e</sup>nasis, </i>however, is used as a measure among the Cyprians
and other peoples; and it is 10 <i>modii </i>of wheat or barley by the <i>modius
</i>of 17 <i>xestai </i>among the Cyprians. But the <i>medimnos </i>varies among
the Cyprians; for the people of Salamis, that is to say, of Constantia, have a <i>medimnos
</i>of 5 <i>modii, </i>while those of Paphos and the Sicilians measure it as 4
1/2 <i>modii.</i></p>
<p><A HREF="#239"><SUP>239</SUP></A>Concerning the seah.<A HREF="#239"><SUP>239</SUP></A>
It is called &quot;seah,&quot; being derived from the Hebrew, {59d} and it is
used as a feminine; but in Greek it is neither feminine nor masculine, that is,
neuter,<A HREF="#240"><SUP>240</SUP></A> for we say <i>saton </i><A HREF="#241"><SUP>241</SUP></A><i>
</i>and not <i>satos. </i>It is an overfull <i>modius, </i>so that it is a <i>modius
</i>and a quarter of a <i>modius </i>by reason of its overfulness,<A HREF="#242"><SUP>242</SUP></A>
which is the overflow of the <i>modius. </i>But it is called a seah, meaning in
this language a &quot;taking up&quot; or &quot;lifting up,&quot; from the
circumstance that the one measuring takes the measure with some force and lifts
it up.</p>
<p><A HREF="#243"><SUP>243</SUP></A>Concerning the <i>modius. </i>Next the <i>modius.</i><A HREF="#243"><SUP>243</SUP></A><i>
</i>The name of the <i>modius </i>was invented by the Hebrews with great
exactness.<A HREF="#244"><SUP>244</SUP></A> For it consists of 22 <i>xestai</i>,<A HREF="#245"><SUP>245</SUP></A>
not in simple fashion or by chance, but from great exactness. Now I speak of the
&quot;just&quot; <A HREF="#246"><SUP>246</SUP></A> <i>modius, </i>as the Law is
accustomed to say, according to the sacred measure. For, O lover of <A NAME="p42"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|42</SPAN></A>&nbsp;the good, God did twenty-two works between the beginning and the seventh day,
which are these:</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C22"></A>22.</SPAN>&nbsp;On the first day,<A HREF="#247"><SUP>247</SUP></A> (1) the upper heavens, {60a} (2) the
earth, (3) the waters----of which consist snow, ice, hail, frost, and dew----and
(4) the spirits that minister before him. They are the angels before his face,
the angels of glory, the angels of the winds that blow, the angels of the clouds
and of the cloud-darknesses, of snow and hail and frost, the angels of sounds,
of the thunders and the lightnings, the angels of the cold and of the heat, of
winter, fall, spring, and summer, and of all the spirits of his creatures in
heaven and on earth. (5) The abysses,<A HREF="#248"><SUP>248</SUP></A> both that which is beneath
the earth and that of the gulf of darkness that was above the abyss of the
waters which were at one time upon the earth,<A HREF="#249"><SUP>249</SUP></A> whence (6) the
darkness----the evening and the night; (7) the light----of the day and of the
morning. These seven great works God did the first day. On the second day, (8)
the firmament that is between the waters.<A HREF="#250"><SUP>250</SUP></A> On this day the waters
were divided; half of them ascended above the firmament, {60b} and half of them remained
below the firmament in the midst upon the face of the whole earth. This is the
only work that God did on the second day. On the third day, (9) the seas, the
rivers, and the fountains and lakes, (10) seed grains and plants, (11) fruit
trees and those without fruit, and (12) forests. These four great works God did
on the third day. On the fourth day, (13) the sun, (14) the moon, (15) the
stars. These three great works God did on the fourth day. On the fifth day, (16)
the great whales, (17) the fishes and the other creeping things in the waters,
(18) the winged birds. These three great works God did on the fifth day. And on
the sixth day, (19) wild beasts, (20) cattle, (21) the creeping things of the
earth, (22) man. These four great works God <A NAME="p43"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|43</SPAN></A>
did on the sixth day. And everything was twenty-two kinds in the {60c} six
days.<A HREF="#251"><SUP>251</SUP></A> And he completed all his works <A HREF="#252"><SUP>252</SUP></A>
on the sixth
day, everything that is in heaven and on earth, in the seas and in the abysses,
in the light and in the darkness, and in everything. And God rested from all his
works on the seventh day, and he blessed it and hallowed it. And he showed Moses
through an angel that there would also be <A HREF="#253"><SUP>253</SUP></A> twenty-two heads from
Adam to Jacob, <A HREF="#254"><SUP>254</SUP></A><sup> </sup>otherwise Israel,<A HREF="#254"><SUP>254</SUP></A><sup> </sup>when he said:
&quot;And I will choose for myself from his seed a people more numerous than any
other people.&quot;<A HREF="#255"><SUP>255</SUP></A> And the heads, <A HREF="#256"><SUP>256</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>which are the
generations,<A HREF="#256"><SUP>256</SUP></A> concerning whom the Lord spoke, are as follows: Adam,
Seth, Enosh, Kenan,<A HREF="#257"><SUP>257</SUP></A> Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech,
Noah, Shem, Arpachshad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Reu----for the Scripture omits
Cainan <A HREF="#258"><SUP>258</SUP></A> from the number <A HREF="#259"><SUP>259</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>----Serug, Nahor, Terah,
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, <A HREF="#260"><SUP>260</SUP></A><sup> </sup>otherwise Israel
<A HREF="#260"><SUP>260</SUP></A>----altogether,
twenty-two generations. Therefore there are twenty-two {60d} letters among the
Hebrews, which are these: <i>alef, beth, gimel, deleth, he, waw, zej, heth,
teth, joth, kaf, lamedh, mem, nun, samekh, <sup>c</sup>ajin, pe, sadhen, qof,
resh, shin, taw</i>.<A HREF="#261"><SUP>261</SUP></A> Therefore also there are twenty-two books of
the Old Testament; but they are said among the Hebrews to be counted as
twenty-two though they are (really) twenty-seven, because five of their letters
also {61a} are double----<i>kaf </i>has a duplicate form, also <i>mem, nun, pe, </i>and
<i>saddhe</i>----for the books also are counted in this manner. <A NAME="p44"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|44</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C23"></A>23.</SPAN>&nbsp;<i>b<sup>e</sup>reshlth,</i><A HREF="#262"><SUP>262</SUP></A><i> </i>which is called the Genesis of

prophet Daniel. <i>d<sup>ec</sup>ezra, </i>which is I Ezra. <i>d<sup>ec</sup>ezra,
</i>which is II Ezra, <i>d'ester, </i>which is Esther. These twenty-seven books
are counted twenty-two according to the number of the letters, because five of
the letters also are double, as we have already said above. But there is also
another little book called <i>qinoth, </i>which is translated the Lamentations {61c} of Jeremiah. And it is joined to Jeremiah; it is in
<A NAME="p45"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|45</SPAN></A> excess of the number, being joined to Jeremiah. This number twenty-two, found
in all these places but counted in different ways, in the twenty-two works that
God did in the six days of the making of the world, in the twenty-two
generations from Adam to Israel, in the twenty-two signs of the letters from <i>alef
</i>to <i>taw, </i>and in the twenty-two books from Genesis to Esther, begets
for us a measure of 22 <i>xestai, </i>called among the Hebrews a <i>mode,</i><A HREF="#271"><SUP>271</SUP></A>
<A HREF="#272"><SUP>272</SUP></A>which the Greeks, translating, call <A HREF="#272"><SUP>272</SUP></A> a
<i>modja;</i><A HREF="#273"><SUP>273</SUP></A><i>
</i>and the Egyptians also similarly say @@@@@ <A HREF="#274"><SUP>274</SUP></A> In the same way
also the Syrians and Arabians say <i>modja, </i><A HREF="#275"><sup>275</sup></A><sup>
</sup>which is
pronounced in Hebrew <i>mode; </i>but it is translated from the Hebrew into the
Greek as <i>modja, </i>which is the <i>mode.</i><A HREF="#275"><sup>275</sup></A>
For if the
<i>modius </i>were not filled up, it would not confess <A HREF="#276"><sup>276</sup></A><sup>
</sup>that which
it holds:<A HREF="#276"><sup>276</sup></A> &quot;I am completed.&quot; <A HREF="#277"><SUP>277</SUP></A>
But according
{61d} to other interpretations it was named differently, for it is called <i>gnomon
</i><A HREF="#278"><SUP>278</SUP></A>  that is, measure; it is called <i>homologia</i>
<A HREF="#279"><SUP>279</SUP></A><i> </i>also <i>homologema, </i>also <i>homologos.
</i><A HREF="#280"><SUP>280</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C24"></A>24.</SPAN>&nbsp;For in the number of the twenty-two works of God at the beginning, and of
the twenty-two generations up to Jacob, and of the twenty-two books up to
Esther, and by reason of the scheme of twenty-two letters in which the Law <A HREF="#281"><SUP>281</SUP></A>
exists for us and the <A HREF="#282"><SUP>282</SUP></A><sup> </sup>teaching of God has prefigured everything
for us,<A HREF="#282"><SUP>282</SUP></A> by this Law <A HREF="#283"><SUP>283</SUP></A>
and the mysteries in it Jesus
Christ is attested to us as one who has come and been revealed, who, coming, by
the Gospel fulfilled for us the measure of life by means of the <i>mode, </i>that
is, confession, to every man who has <A NAME="p46"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|46</SPAN></A>
confessed him and received life through him. Therefore the sacred measure,
the Hebrews say, consists of 22 <i>xestai, </i>according to the number given
above, which is variously employed.<A HREF="#284"><SUP>284</SUP></A> For many of the other peoples
either add to or subtract {62a} from this measure, which is correctly reckoned among the Hebrews. But also among the Romans it happens that the measure is
called by a similar name, <i>modium, </i><A HREF="#285"><SUP>285</SUP></A> just as among the Hebrews
a child is admonished &quot;to learn <i>alef</i>,&quot; and among the Greeks it
happens to be called &quot;to seek to <i>alphaize.&quot; </i><A HREF="#286"><SUP>286</SUP></A><i> </i>Whence
it has come to be known that from the Hebrew it<sup> </sup><A HREF="#287"><sup>287</sup></A>
has been
transferred to the other languages.<A HREF="#288"><SUP>288</SUP></A> So the <i>mode, </i>as it is
found in the Hebrew----it means &quot;to confess,&quot; as I have frequently
said----is explained by the usage. For if a man does not fill it completely, it
does not confess: &quot;I am full.&quot; But when one fills the measure and
strikes <A HREF="#289"><SUP>289</SUP></A> it, <A HREF="#290"><SUP>290</SUP></A>he persuades the measure to confess:<A HREF="#290"><SUP>290</SUP></A>
&quot;I am full.&quot; But when the name was transferred to the Greek, as I have
said, the <i>mode </i>was called the <i>modja </i>for the sake of clearness.<A HREF="#291"><SUP>291</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C25"></A>25.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the cab. The cab, from the same language, is a variable <A HREF="#292"><SUP>292</SUP></A>
measure. Sometimes it is one-fourth of a <i>modius, </i>sometimes one-fifth, {62b} and at other times one-sixth. It nevertheless is a
measure, but it is called a cab because the <i>modius </i>is divided into parts;
for the Hebrew <i>qava </i><A HREF="#293"><SUP>293</SUP></A>  means &quot;he has butchered&quot; or
&quot;he has cut up,&quot; and when transferred to the Greek it was called <i>qaba
</i><A HREF="#294"><SUP>294</SUP></A><i> </i>for the sake of clearness.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C26"></A>26.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the <i>choinix. </i>But the <i>choinix, </i>also the <i>hyfi,
</i>is one measure, though called by two names. But it is variously measured <A NAME="p47"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|47</SPAN></A>
among different <A HREF="#295"><sup>295</sup></A> people. And in the Hebrew language it is used
<A HREF="#296"><SUP>296</SUP></A><sup> </sup>as a masculine, but in the Greek as a feminine. But the Cyprians say <i>choiniqta,
</i>but among them they indicate by it one-eighth of a <i>modius. </i>And the <i>modius
</i>among them, being measured without shaking down but pressed down, consists
of 17 <i>xestai, </i>so that the <i>choinix </i>is 2 <i>xestai </i>and a little
more.<A HREF="#297"><SUP>297</SUP></A> But it is called the <i>hyfi </i>from the Hebrew (term)
which is pronounced <i><sup>'</sup>ofen</i>,<A HREF="#298"><SUP>298</SUP></A> which is a measure of
two handfuls.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C27"></A>27.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning] the handful of meal, like {62c} the handful of meal that the
widow told Elijah she had in a jar.<A HREF="#299"><SUP>299</SUP></A> But this is simple and known
to all, for, from the fact that the one measuring grasps <A HREF="#300"><SUP>300</SUP></A> with one
hand, a handful of one hand is called a handful.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C28"></A>28.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning] the ardeb. This measure was named by the Egyptians, and it
consists of 72 <i>xestai. </i>And this also is so composed with great exactness,
for seventy-two men were building the tower and Babylon at the time when the one
language was confounded into seventy-two.<A HREF="#301"><SUP>301</SUP></A> Hence also they were
called <i>meropes </i><A HREF="#302"><SUP>302</SUP></A>  because of the divided speech. But the <i>metretes
</i>also has the same capacity according to the sacred measure. For there are
also other <i>metretai </i>that are measured variously in different places. In
Cyprus, when filled from the wine press, it is 104 <i>xestai, </i>the four <i>xestai
</i>being reckoned as dregs and the 100 reckoned as pure, because {62d} of the dipping up
<A HREF="#303"><SUP>303</SUP></A> by means of the <i>xestes </i>of the place. But according to the Alexandrian <i>xestes
</i>88 <i>xestai </i>fill the measure, but according to the sacred measure 82
(such) <i>xestai. </i>Sometimes they reckon the capacity of the <i>metretes </i>as
84, sometimes as 88, and sometimes as 96 <i>xestai; </i>but according to the <A NAME="p48"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|48</SPAN></A>
sacred measure it consists of 72 <i>xestai, </i>and the <i>metretes </i>is
for liquids and the ardeb for produce. But that which is called the ardeb is
called the <i>artab&#x00E5; </i>in the language of the Egyptians, which is interpreted
&quot;well composed&quot; or &quot;well constituted.&quot; It is <i>artab&#x00E5; </i>in
the Greek <A HREF="#304"><sup>304</sup></A><sup> </sup>for the sake of clearness. And the Hebrew is abundantly
used to this measure because of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt, whence
they acquired the use of the measure. As it is written in Isaiah: &quot;He that
soweth 6 ardebs shall make three measures&quot; <A HREF="#305"><SUP>305</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>----that is, he
who, from the great abundance of seed, because of the scantiness of the crop
shall gather but a little. For the &quot;three {63a} measures&quot; are a little
omer, they are 6 <i>xestai, </i>so that they are one-twelfth of the ardeb, but
that which (is composed) of 72; and <A HREF="#306"><SUP>306</SUP></A> 6 ardebs are found to be 432 <i>xestai.
</i>And, again, to this point is concerning the ardeb.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C29"></A>29.</SPAN>&nbsp;And since there occurs in juxtaposition in Isaiah, &quot;Where ten
yoke of oxen cultivate&quot;----for he says they cultivate the vineyard with a
plow, by the use of oxen----(the land) &quot;will yield one jar,&quot; <A HREF="#307"><SUP>307</SUP></A>
he thus shows that a measure of land such as this, which is plowed by yokes of
oxen such as these, because of the scantiness of the crop will produce one jar,
that is, a small measure. And so much for that.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C30"></A>30.</SPAN>&nbsp;&quot;Three measures of fine flour,&quot; those which Abraham
commanded Sarah to prepare for the angels,<A HREF="#308"><SUP>308</SUP></A> from which &quot;three
measures&quot; he commanded an ash cake <A HREF="#309"><SUP>309</SUP></A> to be made. Every one of
these measures held 1 omer. The omer, however, is one-tenth {63b} of the great
measure, that is, of the ardeb, which makes 7 1/5 <i>xestai. </i><A HREF="#310"><SUP>310</SUP></A>
And,
again, in the measure of the omer there are three measures, which are 2 2/5 <A HREF="#311"><sup>311</sup></A><sup>
</sup><i>xestai </i>each. Now the measure has this form, but the measure is also
appropriate for the spiritual contemplation of those who are
esteemed worthy to understand. For the manna also was given an <A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|49</SPAN></A>
omer by measure, which according to the priesthood is a tithe,<A HREF="#312"><SUP>312</SUP></A>
but according to the significance of the name----because it is a tenth of the
great measure----it signifies <i>jodh,</i><A HREF="#313"><SUP>313</SUP></A><i> </i>which is the beginning
of the name of Jesus, who in this measure, since the &quot;three measures&quot;
are summed up in one, showed <A HREF="#314"><SUP>314</SUP></A> them the equality of essence in the
holy Trinity. And as to our saying that Abraham commanded Sarah, this also is (a
matter) for investigation. For the three men were not going to eat such a
measure as this; for when the &quot;three measures&quot; are combined as one in 1 omer, these {63c} three make a <i>modius </i>of 22
<i>xestai,</i><A HREF="#315"><SUP>315</SUP></A><i>
</i>that is, the sacred measure. Not at all, therefore, (was it) because they
were about to consume all this, but that nothing might be lacking from the name
of the Trinity. For in the measure there is a trinity, but in the bread there is
one unity and one taste; for there is also in Deity nothing that is changeable.
But what he said, &quot;Make an ash cake,&quot; <A HREF="#316"><sup>316</sup></A><sup>
</sup>signified that
there was always bread, but it was not revealed to all the world. But it was in
heaven, God the Word. In the seed of Abraham, however, it was concealed by the
Advent that was to be. Now the preparation of the ash cake is in this manner.
When the bread has been kneaded and has afterward fermented, it is kneaded
again. They bake this bread not in an oven but on a rock. Collecting smooth
stones and piling them upon the ground, by means of much brushwood they heat
them until they make of the smooth (stones) glowing embers. {63d} Then they remove the ashes from them, cover them with
dough, and again spread the ashes over all the dough, spreading it out as one
loaf; and hence it is called &quot;hidden,&quot; because concealed in the ashes.
Moreover, that which was in this symbol was fulfilled. <A NAME="p50"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|50</SPAN></A>
Caleb the son of Jephunneh, after Guz<sup>e</sup>va his first wife died,<A HREF="#317"><SUP>317</SUP></A>
took to wife <sup>'</sup>Afar<sup>e</sup>tha, who also was a widow. And he
received from Joshua the (son) of Nun as a portion the city of K<sup>e</sup>varta,<A HREF="#318"><SUP>318</SUP></A>
which is interpreted &quot;doxology,&quot; and he built and joined to the first
city the second (city of) 'Afar<sup>e</sup>tha,<A HREF="#319"><SUP>319</SUP></A> which is
interpreted &quot;fruitfulness,&quot; after the name of his wife, 'Afar<sup>e</sup>tha.
Besides other sons he begat of her a son whose name was Bethlehem,<A HREF="#320"><SUP>320</SUP></A>
after he had begotten Lammon,<A HREF="#321"><sup>321</sup></A><sup> </sup>Arad,<A HREF="#322"><SUP>322</SUP></A> and others.
Since he loved the youth, he built a third city and joined it to these two
former cities and called it Bethlehem,<A HREF="#323"><sup>323</sup></A><sup> </sup>which {64a} is interpreted
&quot;house of bread.&quot; And, indeed, the name was in use; <A HREF="#324"><SUP>324</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>but
it was not revealed until there came from heaven, being bom of Mary in
Bethlehem, that is, in the house of bread, he that said: &quot;I am the living
bread that came down from heaven.&quot;<sup> </sup><A HREF="#325"><sup>325</sup></A>
For the place had been
named of yore; but the bread had not been revealed, for it was
&quot;hidden.&quot;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C31"></A>31.</SPAN>&nbsp;Three baskets of coarse meal. The Scripture does not use this term,
baskets,<A HREF="#326"><SUP>326</SUP></A> as a measure, but rather to specify the reed baskets<sup>
<A HREF="#327">327</A> </sup>which the people use customarily. But as to the &quot;coarse meal&quot;
that is mentioned, which they were accustomed at the time to put in reed
baskets, this coarse meal is a kind of wheat cut in two. But fine flour is the
heart of the wheat, in fine grains; for from these processes the origin of
milling came about.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C32"></A>32.</SPAN>&nbsp;The <i>nevel </i>of wine. The <i>nevel </i>is a measure that is put
into two wine skins, (a measure) which consists of 150 {64b} <i>xestai</i>,<A HREF="#328"><SUP>328</SUP></A>
which makes 3 liquid seahs, for the seah is 50 <i>xestai. </i>Further, this means a
&quot;taking <A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A> up,<A HREF="#329"><SUP>329</SUP></A> that which a man, after filling, would draw up by man power
from the pit of the wine press, as much as he was able to lift with his two
hands from &quot;the pit of the wine press. But <i>nevel </i>is interpreted
&quot;something to be carried,&quot; <A HREF="#330"><SUP>330</SUP></A> which is a load of wine,<A HREF="#331"><SUP>331</SUP></A>
which is also called a <i>foreus, </i>as the Cyprians call the great jar which
holds 150 <i>xestai, </i>which a young man can carry on his shoulder from one
little place to another.<A HREF="#332"><SUP>332</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C33"></A>33.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>kollathon</i>.] Among the Syrians the <i>kollathon
</i>is half of a liquid seah, which is 25 <i>xestai.</i><A HREF="#333"><SUP>333</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C34"></A>34.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>shatifta.</i>] The <i>shatifta </i>of ointment,
as it is written in the Gospel,<A HREF="#334"><SUP>334</SUP></A> is a vessel of glass in accordance
with the name; but there is in it a <i>libra </i>of oil by weight, and in
capacity there is half a <i>xestes </i><A HREF="#335"><SUP>335</SUP></A><i> </i>But it is called an
<i>alabastron
</i><A HREF="#336"><SUP>336</SUP></A> because of the great {64c} fragility, which is like salt. For the Scripture says: &quot;And
it shall be broken in pieces like an <i>alabastron.</i>&quot; <A HREF="#337"><SUP>337</SUP></A><i>
</i>And
it is, as I have said, a vessel round in form.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C35"></A>35.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>kapsakes</i>.] The <i>kapsakes </i>of water has
a capacity of 12 <i>xestai, </i>which corresponds to the cab,<A HREF="#338"><SUP>338</SUP></A> the
grain measure that is called the <i>q<sup>e</sup>vuna. </i><A HREF="#339"><SUP>339</SUP></A><i>
</i>This, however, is the great <i>kapsakes,</i> <A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A>
the one-fourth division of the seah. Some call it the '<i>espadhjun</i>,<A HREF="#340"><SUP>340</SUP></A>
that is, the libation cup.<A HREF="#340"><SUP>340</SUP></A> But that which was prepared for Elijah
<A HREF="#341"><SUP>341</SUP></A>
was also a <i>kapsakes, </i>with 4 <i>xestai </i>in the measure, but called in
the feminine <i>q<sup>e</sup>vurta. </i>And it was equal in
capacity to the <i>stamnos, </i>in which <i>stamnos </i>are 4 Italian or
Alexandrian <i>xestai. </i>For there were placed in the ark, that is, in the
chest, four books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers. For it was in the
thirty-eighth year of the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt that Deuteronomy
was commanded to be written {64d} and placed by the side of the ark and not
joined to these four, so that it might not obscure the measure which had been
required in conformity with the number. For there are four rivers out of Eden,
four quarters of the world, four seasons of the year, four watches in the night,
four successive times for prayers in a day and (corresponding) periods,
four <i>xestai </i>in the <i>stamnos </i><A HREF="#342"><SUP>342</SUP></A> measure for the
manna, four spiritual creatures which were composed of four faces,<A HREF="#343"><SUP>343</SUP></A>
which typify the coming of the Messiah. One had the face of a man, because the
Messiah was born a man in Bethlehem, as Matthew teaches.<A HREF="#344"><SUP>344</SUP></A> One had
the face of a lion, as Mark proclaims him coining up from the Jordan,<A HREF="#345"><SUP>345</SUP></A>
a lion king, as also somewhere it is written: ''The Lord has come up as a lion
from the Jordan.&quot;<A HREF="#346"><SUP>346</SUP></A> One had the face of an ox, as Luke
proclaims----not he alone, but also the other Evangelists----him who, at the
appointed time of the ninth hour,<A HREF="#347"><SUP>347</SUP></A> like an ox in behalf of the
world {65a} was offered up on the cross. One had the face of an eagle, as John
proclaims the Word who came from heaven and was made flesh <A HREF="#348"><SUP>348</SUP></A> and
flew to heaven like an eagle after the resurrection with the Godhead. And these
things also I have related concerning the <i>stamnos, </i>because in the <i>stamnos,
</i>which has been handed down as a feminine noun, was placed the manna, which
was the heavenly bread but symbolized the Perpetual Virgin Mary, who is indeed
gold from the &quot;tried gold&quot; <A HREF="#349"><SUP>349</SUP></A> by reason of the evidence of
her virginity. But it <A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A> contained the manna which came down from heaven, and because of the little faith
of those who saw the manna it received this name. It was called <i>man; </i>but
this is translated: &quot;What is this?&quot; For when they saw it upon the face
of the earth they said: &quot;What is this?&quot;<A HREF="#350"><SUP>350</SUP></A> For they were
going to say to the Messiah: &quot;Who is this that speaks blasphemy?&quot;<A HREF="#351"><SUP>351</SUP></A> So the <i>stamnos </i>contained the manna,
{65b} in which was a measure by reason of the 4 <i>xestai, </i>and Mary
(contained) the Word that was proclaimed through the four Evangelists. For she
herself was the holy ark to which it pointed, of which the ark that was
fashioned in the wilderness was a type. Moreover, that was of wood, in which was
the Word inscribed on two tablets of stone and in the other books, the four
books together and the fifth book which was at the side, that is, Deuteronomy.
But although he that uttered the divine Word was in it, yet the ark was also
made as a type of her. But, being priceless, it was carried; and the Word that
was in it spoke through him that read, since it did not speak of its own
volition.<A HREF="#352"><SUP>352</SUP></A> But the holy Mary, the living ark, had the living
<A HREF="#353"><SUP>353</SUP></A> Word borne within her. While she had within her {65c} another ark which was also alive, there was in the ark
that had been placed in her the living Word. And, further, when David the
prophet was bringing the ark up to Zion, he danced before it, singing and
rejoicing.<A HREF="#354"><SUP>354</SUP></A> And it was not a miracle, but rather a sign by way of
prophecy. &quot;For these things happened typically, and they were written as an
admonition for us unto whom the ends of the times have come,&quot; as the
apostolic words teach.<A HREF="#355"><SUP>355</SUP></A> But here was a miracle. For when the living
ark----I speak of Mary----entered the house of Elizabeth, the child John danced
in the womb of his mother, leaping for joy before the ark on account of him whom
she was bearing, the living Word, the Messiah.<A HREF="#356"><SUP>356</SUP></A> But the living Word
also was a living ark in his own living body, who, on account of the sacrifice
in lieu of our death, submitted to a three days' sleep. When he was awakened by the word of the prophet, he heard the one hundred {65d} thirty-first
Psalm: &quot;Arise in thy rest, thou and the ark of thy holy covenant.&quot;<A HREF="#357"><SUP>357</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>For they called the Godhead of the only-begotten to arise from the lower
parts of the earth with his holy soul, and also at the same time <A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A>
(called) his completely assumed human nature, his body, as they hint and say,
&quot;thou and the ark of thy holy covenant,&quot; so that they might say his
holy body. And these are the things concerning the <i>stamnos, </i>which
consisted of the 4 <i>xestai </i>of manna, from which also we know the
significance of the ark in which was the law in the four books before
Deuteronomy (was written) and the ark and <i>stamnos </i>of Mary
which contained in the four Gospels the manna, the heavenly bread, and the ark,
in which ark----I mean, in the holy body----the heavenly Word, when he came
down, was given to the world. But I mean to those who believed in him, through
the four Gospels believed the things that were preached. Up to here is enough
concerning the <i>stamnos, </i>{66a} we think, O lover of the good.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C36"></A>36.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>kotyle</i>.] The <i>kotyle </i>is half a <i>xestes,
</i>and it is called a <i>kotyle </i>because the <i>xestes </i>is cut in two.
For they call those who sell wine or oil by the <i>xestes kotylistai, </i>because
they divide up what they sell into small measures.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C37"></A>37.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>kyathos</i>.] The <i>kyathos </i>is not one
measure but various (measures), for it is defined by the mixed drink in the cup,
in one place a simple cup which is one-sixth of a <i>xestes, </i>in another a
double cup which is one-third of a <i>xestes. </i>But it is a dipper,
by the use of which they dip up from a jar by means of the long handle. It has a
form like that of a small inkstand, and one lifts it by the handle in order to
draw from the depths of the jar that which he is about to take in the cup as a
mixed drink. But in translation from the Hebrew language into the Greek, in some
books it is called by this name <i>(kyathos)</i>; but in a few
books it is put down according to the Hebrew term, not being translated. When
therefore you find in the preparation for the setting up of the tabernacle {66b} both the
<i>medekoth
</i>and the <i>masmaroth, </i>know that <i>medekoth </i>means <i>kyathoi
</i>and <i>masmaroth </i>means <A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A> strainers. But many times when this word is employed it is used for <i>ethmoi;
</i>for <i>ethmoi </i>and strainers, on account of one and the same use, are
alike called <i>masmaroth </i>in the Hebrew.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C38"></A>38.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>tryblion</i>.] The form of the <i>tryblion </i>is
that of the <i>scutella,</i><A HREF="#358"><SUP>358</SUP></A><i> </i>that is, a dish.<A HREF="#359"><SUP>359</SUP></A> But it
has a capacity of half a <i>xestes.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C39"></A>39.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>xestes</i>.] Although the <i>xestes </i>is
particularly well known to everybody, yet we speak of it because its standard is
variously fixed <A HREF="#360"><SUP>360</SUP></A> among many peoples. For there is the Italian, the
Alexandrian, the <i>castrensis,</i><A HREF="#361"><SUP>361</SUP></A> the Pontic, and the
Nicomedian. The Pontic is four times that of Alexandria; this is the <i>stamnos </i>already
mentioned, when used as a wine measure. But it is otherwise adduced by weight, for in oil there are 8 <i>librae. </i>{66c} For an Alexandrian <i>xestes
</i>holds <A HREF="#362"><sup>362</sup></A><sup> </sup>a weight of 2 <i>librae </i>in oil, and the Italian <i>xestes
</i>holds 22 ounces; the <i>castrensis </i>also similarly holds 24 ounces, more
or less, and the Nicomedian 20 ounces.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C40"></A>40.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>aporryma</i>.] The <i>aporryma </i>is employed
as a measure among the Thebans only, for it is half a <i>sa&iuml;tes. </i>And its
form is that of a small jar of the type of the <i>saites. </i>The true <i>saites,
</i>however, consists of 22 <i>xestai,</i><A HREF="#363"><SUP>363</SUP></A><i> </i>so that the <i>aporryma
</i>consists of 11 <i>xestai. </i>For there is another <i>sa&iuml;tes </i>called the
Nicaean, a jar of 8 or 10 <i>xestai. </i>And it was called the <i>sa&iuml;tes </i>from
the city of Sa&iuml;s, where the measure and the form of the <i>saites </i>were
invented.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C41"></A>41.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>shafitha</i>.] (As for) the <i>shafitha, </i>this
is a Syriac term which occurs as a measure among the people of Gaza and Ashkelon and the rest of the seacoast called the Shefelah. Hence in Gaza {66d} and
Ashkelon <A HREF="#364"><SUP>364</SUP></A> they call the jar which is the <i>shafitha
</i><A HREF="#365"><SUP>365</SUP></A>  the <i>sapation, </i>which is translated &quot;the drawing vessel of the
wine press,&quot; <A HREF="#366"><SUP>366</SUP></A> for with the measure they draw out and carry
wine. But among the people of <A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A> Ashkelon it consists of 22
<i>xestai, </i><A HREF="#367"><SUP>367</SUP></A><i> </i>among those of Azotus
18 <i>xestai, </i>and among those of Gaza 14 <i>xestai.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C42"></A>42.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the hin. The hin also is mentioned in the divine Scriptures,
as are also many of those already discussed. Therefore the Scripture cautions
many times and says &quot;by the great measure,&quot; &quot;by that of the
sanctuary.&quot; <A HREF="#368"><SUP>368</SUP></A> And the great hin consists of 18 <i>xestai, </i>that
is, one-fourth of a <i>metretes. </i>But the sacred hin consists of 9 <i>xestai,
</i>one-sixth of which the prophet Ezekiel was ordered to drink daily, to whom
the Lord said: &quot;And water thou shalt drink by measure, one-sixth of a
hin,&quot; <A HREF="#369"><SUP>369</SUP></A> that is, 1 1/2 <i>xestai.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C43"></A>43.</SPAN>&nbsp;{67a} Concerning the <i>chus. </i>The <i>chus </i>is taken from the
Hebrew term that is pronounced <i>kuza. </i><A HREF="#370"><SUP>370</SUP></A> The complete <i>(chus)
</i>consists of 8 <i>xestai </i><sup><A HREF="#371"><SUP>371</SUP></A>  </sup>but the one called
&quot;sacred&quot; consists of 6 <i>xestai. </i>For compared with the <i>metretes
</i>the great <i>(chus) </i>is one-ninth; but as compared with the <i>samios, </i>which
is employed among the Cyprians, it is one-sixth, for the <i>trichus </i>is half
a <i>samios. </i>But the <i>chus, </i>according to the sacred measure, which is
the <i>kuz&#x00E5;, </i>is one-twelfth of the <i>metretes, </i>6 <i>xestai.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C44"></A>44.</SPAN>&nbsp;To this point we have discussed such measures as we have mentioned,
but hereafter we speak of weights.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C45"></A>45.</SPAN>&nbsp;Discussion concerning the talent. The talent is that measure used
in weighing that exceeds every other. And it is called the talent from the
circumstance that equal<sup> </sup><A HREF="#372"><SUP>372</SUP></A> weights fall into the two scale pans of a
balance, and by the weight that is equal in counterpoise that which is in the other scale pan is weighed, that {67b} is, suspended.<A HREF="#373"><SUP>373</SUP></A>
But the talent is called @@@ <A HREF="#374"><SUP>374</SUP></A> among the Hebrews, that is, the @@@,<A HREF="#375"><SUP>375</SUP></A>
<A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb> </SPAN>which in <i>librae </i>consists of 125 <i>librae </i>by weight. But according
to the <i>lepta </i>of coinage, when cut up <A HREF="#376"><SUP>376</SUP></A> into <i>lepta, </i>it
is divided into 6,000 <i>lepta. </i>Accountants call this the unit.<A HREF="#377"><SUP>377</SUP></A>
It is not the only (unit) for reckoning large sums, for there is also the unit
involved in the &quot;10,000 denarii.&quot; There are, however, 6,000 <i>lepta </i>in
1 talent. The <i>lepta </i>are called <i>assaria, </i>concerning which it is
said in the Gospel: &quot;Are not two sparrows sold for one <i>assarion?&quot; </i><A HREF="#378"><SUP>378</SUP></A>
Or, again: &quot;Are not five sparrows sold for two <i>assaria?&quot;</i><A HREF="#379"><SUP>379</SUP></A><i>
</i>But they are called <i>assaria </i>when the smallest (weight) is translated
from the Hebrew.<A HREF="#380"><SUP>380</SUP></A> Sixty <i>assaria, </i>however, are a
<i>denarion,</i><A HREF="#381"><SUP>381</SUP></A><i>
</i>and 100 <i>denaria </i>are a silver (coin).<A HREF="#382"><SUP>382</SUP></A> And they were 2 <i>denarii
</i>that fell from the widow into the treasury; <A HREF="#383"><SUP>383</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>{67c} they have
also been called 2 <i>lepta, </i>for <i>assaria </i>are the smallest <A HREF="#384"><SUP>384</SUP></A>
things that can be. And the <i>argyrus </i>was coined as a coin from the
beginning; therefore they also say <i>argyroi.</i><A HREF="#385"><SUP>385</SUP></A><i> </i>This came
originally from the Assyrians, and they say that Abraham brought this coin <A HREF="#386"><SUP>386</SUP></A>
to Canaan. The 1/125<i> </i>part of the talent is the <i>libra. </i>The <i>centenarius
</i>was invented among the Romans, for it also bears a Roman name. They say <i>centum
</i>for 100, and it is a weight of 100 <i>librae.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C46"></A>46.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>litra</i>.] The <i>litra,</i><A HREF="#387"><SUP>387</SUP></A><i> </i>however,
consists of 12 ounces. As to its name, it also is from the Hebrew, for <i><span class="Greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;</span>
</i>means <A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A> &quot;It is mine,&quot; which is in every case persuasive and
reassuring to him that receives and to him that gives.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C47"></A>47.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the ounce.] And it is named the ounce, on the one hand
according to the height in the measure or by the spaced altitude; on the other
hand it is measured in scales <A HREF="#388"><SUP>388</SUP></A> for weighing by the heaviness of a
(known) weight, and by the knob of the scales it is determined according to the
swerving, being estimated and weighed according to the lines of distance. {67d} And there are in the ounce 2 staters, because of
that which was said by our Savior to Peter: &quot;Cast your hook into the sea
and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find
a stater&quot;----called in the Hebrew a <i>zuz&#x00E5;; </i><A HREF="#389"><SUP>389</SUP></A>
&quot;taking
this, give for me and yourself.&quot; <A HREF="#390"><SUP>390</SUP></A> For it was a stater
containing half an ounce or 2 double <i>zuze, </i>since the Pharisees said to
Peter: &quot;Does not your master pay the double <i>zuz&#x00E5;?&quot; </i><A HREF="#391"><SUP>391</SUP></A>
For
by the census of King Augustus there was to be paid what they called the poll
tax,<A HREF="#392"><SUP>392</SUP></A> but in the Roman language <i>capitatio, </i>for they call the
head a <i>caput. </i>So the Pharisees said: &quot;Does not your master pay the
double <i>zuz&#x00E5;?&quot; </i>which is 2 <i>zuze.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C48"></A>48.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the shekel.] One shekel is that which is transliterated
from the Hebrew language <i>shekel, </i><A HREF="#393"><SUP>393</SUP></A>  meaning inclination, for
they say the <i>shekel </i>pulls down.<A HREF="#394"><SUP>394</SUP></A> There are in it two of what
are called <i>lepta, </i>which makes 2 <i>zuze; </i>{68a} but 2 double <i>zuze, </i>which
is 2 shekels <A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A> according to the sacred shekel,<A HREF="#395"><SUP>395</SUP></A> make 1 stater. The weight of this
stater is the sum of 2 double <i>zuze, </i>the complete measure of two poll
taxes, as the Lord said: &quot;Give a stater for me and you.&quot; For this is
what was ordered by Augustus to be paid for every poll. But the shekel is also
called a <i>kodrantes, </i><A HREF="#396"><SUP>396</SUP></A>  for there are 2 <i>zuze </i>in it. But
when it is changed or divided it is divided into many <i>lepta, </i>for the
silver (coin) which is called by the Hebrews a mina----that is, a number <A HREF="#397"><SUP>397</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>----contains
100 <i>denarii; </i>its fourth is 25 <i>denarii </i>when it is changed. So when
it is changed, because it is bound up in a bag, it is called a <i>kodrantes, </i>for
they call a bag of silver a <i>kodarion. </i><A HREF="#398"><SUP>398</SUP></A>  But the shekel,
which is one-fourth {68b} of an ounce, one-half of a stater, contains 2 <i>zuze; </i>for
one-eighth of an ounce is a <i>zuz&#x00E5;. </i>And the <i>zuz&#x00E5; </i>was also called a <i>holke.
</i><A HREF="#399"><SUP>399</SUP></A>  By this weight----I mean the shekel----they weighed the hair
of Absalom every time he had his hair cut; and it possessed the weight of 125
shekels, which is 31 ounces and 1 shekel, that is, 2 1/2 <i>librae </i>and 5
shekels.<A HREF="#400"><SUP>400</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C49"></A>49.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the obolus. The obolus also was coined among the silver
(coins). The one, however, made not of silver but of iron is one-eighth of an
ounce,<A HREF="#401"><SUP>401</SUP></A> for this used to be an arrow.<A HREF="#402"><SUP>402</SUP></A> For the life of
man before the coming of Christ was hemmed in by wars, so that they had need of
arrows against those of the enemy. By means of such things as these they did business, {68c} everyone giving five or ten arrows
when purchasing bread or anything else. But this was in weight one-seventh of an
ounce; and with our own eyes we have seen this kind, O lover of the good. For on
the island of Cyprus many kings and tyrants seized the government in antiquity.
And going up for a walk <A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A> to one of the ancient castles which had revolted once upon a time, we entered
where there had been a palace, where there was stored a portion of the tyrant's
pay which was given to the soldiers under him from time to time. And there had
been placed in a heap these obeloi,<A HREF="#403"><sup>403</sup></A><sup> </sup>which were fashioned by early
man for use as money. But they were also employed in the wars. Moreover, these
things concerning the oboloi, such as I have expounded and adduced, I was
compelled to say because the divine Scripture says: &quot;The whole world of
capital belongs to the faithful; {68d} not even an obolus belongs to the
unfaithful.&quot; <A HREF="#404"><SUP>404</SUP></A> But there was also another obolus that was
coined of silver, which was a very small coin; it is one-eightieth of an ounce.<A HREF="#405"><SUP>405</SUP></A>
For it is said in Leviticus: &quot;The double <i>zuz&#x00E5; </i>shall be 20
oboloi.&quot; <A HREF="#406"><SUP>406</SUP></A> We have already shown that the double
<i>zuz&#x00E5; </i>is
one-fourth of an ounce.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C50"></A>50.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the <i>chalkoi. </i>(As for) the <i>chalkoi, </i>the
Egyptians invented them. They are silver (coins) that are coined; for this
reason the silver coins are called coppers <A HREF="#407"><SUP>407</SUP></A> among the Alexandrians.
But the <i>chalkus </i>is one-eighth of an ounce by weight, like the <i>zuz&#x00E5;.</i><A HREF="#408"><SUP>408</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C51"></A>51.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the mina. Mina is for <i>mane.</i><A HREF="#409"><SUP>409</SUP></A><i> </i>For in
the Hebrew the silver (coin) is called the <i>mane. </i>But the Italian mina
consists of 40 {69a} staters, that is, of 20 ounces----a <i>libra </i>and two-thirds. But
that which is called the barbarian, the Theban, consists of 60 staters, that is,
2 1/2 <i>librae. </i>But they coin other minas, some of 2 <i>librae, </i>some of
4, everyone according to his pleasure. And there have been many types of silver
(coins) from time to time. <A NAME="p61"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|61</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C52"></A>52.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>nummus</i>. <A HREF="#410"><SUP>410</SUP></A>] A certain <i>nummus </i>was
once called after one Numa who was a king of the Romans, and in accordance with
his name the coin was coined. But the ancients called half of the silver <i>(denarius)
</i>the <i>dichryson.</i><A HREF="#411"><SUP>411</SUP></A><i> </i>And the silver <i>(denarius) </i>is what
the Romans call the <i>miliarision</i>,<A HREF="#412"><SUP>412</SUP></A><i> </i>which is translated
&quot;military gift.&quot; <A HREF="#413"><SUP>413</SUP></A> This <i>dichryson </i>also was the
silver (coin) that was later called repudiated. After the king had been killed, {69b} his stamp was still
engraved upon the <i>dichryson. </i>When his coin came to be repudiated it was
called fraudulent, that is, repudiated. But you find this term in the prophet
also, O lover of learning, as he says: &quot;Call them repudiated silver.&quot; <A HREF="#414"><SUP>414</SUP></A>
But the Cyprians and other peoples call the <i>assarion </i>by the Greek name <i>ziretia.</i><A HREF="#415"><SUP>415</SUP></A><i>
</i>And, again, the ancients had silver (coins) that were called <i>lityra,</i><A HREF="#415"><SUP>415</SUP></A><i>
</i>also <i>tyria;</i><A HREF="#415"><SUP>415</SUP></A><i> </i>but we do not know how heavy these were as to
weight.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C53"></A>53.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning the <i>follis</i>.] The <i>follis </i>is also called
the purse,<A HREF="#416"><SUP>416</SUP></A><sup> </sup>because it is a multiple; for it is 2 1/2 silver
(coins), which is 250 <A HREF="#417"><sup>417</sup></A><sup> </sup><i>denarii. </i>Two <i>lepta </i>are a <i>follis
</i>according to the copper coinage,<A HREF="#418"><SUP>418</SUP></A> but not according to the
silver coinage. This also was of silver.<A HREF="#419"><SUP>419</SUP></A> And, moreover, even at
the present time the Romans make use of this <A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A>
number, {69c} 125 pieces of silver in number being considered among the
Romans as heaped up together to make one purse, because the profusion of the
quantity of the silver pieces fills the bag. For as the talent contains 125 <i>librae
</i>by number, so also in the case of the <i>follis </i>125 silver <i>(denarii) </i>complete
<A HREF="#420"><SUP>420</SUP></A>
the number. But you also find this, O lover of the good, in the book of
Kingdoms, when Naaman the Syrian, turning in the chariot, went to meet with
Gehazi and he, as if sent by Elisha personally, said, lying: &quot;My lord sent
me, saying: 'There have come to me two needy sons of the prophets. But send them
two garments and a talent of silver.' &quot; And he said: &quot;Take two talents
of silver and two garments that may be changed,&quot; And he put the two talents
into two bags and placed them upon two young men.<A HREF="#421"><SUP>421</SUP></A></p>
<p>Now a talent, {69d} we say, consists of 125 <i>librae, </i>that is, the great
talent; and this was placed in bags because it was in coins. For the number 125
is called a talent because of its great weight. For when we wish to mention what
is excessive in weight we say &quot;exceeding the talent,&quot; but when (a
matter) of simple number, the number 125 is employed.<A HREF="#422"><sup>422</sup></A><sup> </sup>And, again,
it is called the <i>follis </i>because of the interpretation &quot;bag&quot;;
and in <i>lepta </i>it lumps up <A HREF="#423"><SUP>423</SUP></A> 125 <i>lepta </i>of silver
<A HREF="#424"><SUP>424</SUP></A>
in one coin (name) <A HREF="#425"><SUP>425</SUP></A><sup> </sup>so as to be called individually a<i> follis, </i>being
mentioned by this name &quot;bag.&quot; In accordance with another explanation
among the Hebrews, the term <i>sala </i><A HREF="#426"><SUP>426</SUP></A>  is used; but this coin is
entirely of silver, the weight half an ounce. This is what Abraham proposed to
give to the sons of <A NAME="p63"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|63</SPAN></A> Shechem as the price of the field because of the double cave, saying,
&quot;four hundred double <i>zuze </i>between us,&quot; <A HREF="#427"><SUP>427</SUP></A> which were
200 <i>salim. </i>{70a} And <A HREF="#428"><SUP>428</SUP></A> the <i>sala </i>is interpreted as <i>follis </i>because
of the roundness of form of the coin. The round scales of reptiles are called <i>folides.</i><A HREF="#429"><sup>429</sup></A><i><sup>
</sup></i>When this is reckoned in talents the number is carried up to 125 <i>librae,
</i>but when in <i>folles </i>they are composed of 125 (<i>denarii) </i>of
silver. It has the name of bag among the Romans, but among the Hebrews and
Greeks that of snake scales.<A HREF="#430"><SUP>430</SUP></A> But the Alexandrians, having reduced
the talent to the smallest (subdivisions), made it consist of 15 silver (coins)
in number, for a silver (coin) was 100 <i>denarii. </i>And in a <i>denarius </i>there
were 4 <i>lepta. </i>So all these made up 6,000 <A HREF="#431"><SUP>431</SUP></A>
<i>lepta </i>in a
talent. To this point, again, as regards the weights and the silver (coins) and
the measures and the numbers which we have adduced, we have also made
explanation.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C54"></A>54.</SPAN>&nbsp;The names of the measures <A HREF="#432"><SUP>432</SUP></A> locally. The <i>mares
</i><A HREF="#433"><SUP>433</SUP></A><i> </i>is a measure among the people of Pontus consisting of 2 pots; but the pot {70b} among them
consists of 10 <i>xestai, </i>so that the <i>kupros </i><A HREF="#434"><SUP>434</SUP></A>
consists
of 20 Alexandrian <i>xestai. </i>Among the people of Pontus the <i>kupros </i>is
a measure of dry produce of 2 <i>modii; </i>but it (the <i>modius) </i>is said
by them to consist of 5 <i>choinikes, </i>and the <i>choinix </i>of 2 <i>xestai,
</i>among them, so that the <i>kupros </i>would consist of 20 <i>xestai. </i>For
there is also a great <i>modius </i>among them of 24 <i>xestai. </i>The <i>litra
</i>is translated by the Romans as <i>libra, </i>which among the Romans
etymologically <A HREF="#435"><SUP>435</SUP></A> means equality, that is to say, equality by
measure. And there is in it 12 ounces. But from what language the name of the
ounce has come we do not know with <A NAME="p64"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|64</SPAN></A> certainty;<A HREF="#436"><SUP>436</SUP></A> but from what we conjecture the ounce is called by a
Greek name, being named because of the many parts in the <i>litra. </i>However,
the <i>litra </i>is also said to be perhaps from the Hebrew or Syriac language, as we have said above. For the <i>li </i>is, {70c} being
translated, &quot;to me,&quot; and the <i>tra </i>is &quot;it is&quot;; so that
it will be: &quot;Full weight belongs to him that receives.&quot; But the <i>litra
</i>makes 288 grams, and every gram consists of 6 carats. But carats are the
seeds that are found in the fruit of the carob tree. And this seed weight, if it
is complete, equals the weight of 2 fat barley (corns), so that the <i>litra </i>consists
of 3,456 <A HREF="#437"><SUP>437</SUP></A> barleycorns, 1,728 carats, 288 grams,
<A HREF="#438"><SUP>438</SUP></A><sup> </sup>12
ounces. But the ounce consists of 24 grams. And again, divided differently, the
ounce is put <A HREF="#439"><SUP>439</SUP></A> in yet other terms. For the Hebrews, dividing the
ounce into other parts, called it by other names.<A HREF="#440"><SUP>440</SUP></A> For they called
half an ounce a stater from the circumstance that when the scale pans on both sides are equal in inclination, {70d} if half an ounce is put into
each side of the balances and the equipoise of the beam is brought about in
accordance with the pointer that is in the middle of the balances, it comes <A HREF="#441"><SUP>441</SUP></A>
to be called a stater.<A HREF="#442"><SUP>442</SUP></A> That is, the half of an ounce which was
determined by the equality of inclination they called a stater, that which was
called by them the double <i>zuz&#x00E5;. </i>And the stater with them is the
half-ounce, 2 shekels as they are called in the Hebrew, as we have said above,
while according to the etymology of the language they are interpreted through <i>sekel<sup>
</sup></i><A HREF="#443"><sup>443</sup></A><i> </i>as a &quot;taking up&quot; <A HREF="#444"><SUP>444</SUP></A>
or a &quot;weighing down,&quot; <A HREF="#445"><SUP>445</SUP></A> as we say &quot;it weighs down&quot; or &quot;it inclines.&quot; And, again, the
shekel, which is half a stater, one-fourth of an ounce, has 2 <i>lepta</i> <A NAME="p65"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|65</SPAN></A>
in it. And the <i>lepton </i>is a weight which is one-eighth of an ounce, and
by some it is also called the obelus.<A HREF="#446"><SUP>446</SUP></A> But some divide the ounce
into 7 obeloi, while some change {71a} the name obelus. Since it is numbered among
the weights they call it the obolus, because the ancients, consuming their lives
in war, did their business by means of arrows, for the arrow was called the
obelus. And a man would give 2 obeloi and get bread or anything else pertaining
to food. Therefore in the temple in Jerusalem there sat the money-changers who
were called <i>trapezitai,</i><A HREF="#447"><SUP>447</SUP></A><i> </i>whose tables the Lord overturned,<A HREF="#448"><SUP>448</SUP></A>
which (tables) were for the coinage, which gets its name from this circumstance,
that at royal courts by this means men think <A HREF="#449"><SUP>449</SUP></A> that the world is
controlled. But it was called silver (coinage) because at the time it was made
of silver with the image of the king on it. There was a large one, (used) as a
symbol and a weight, that was called a silver (talent), as I have already said, of 100 <i>denaria.</i><A HREF="#450"><SUP>450</SUP></A>
But every <i>denarion </i>was
{71b} 60 <i>assaria. </i>The silver (coin), however, that is current is that
which is called the mina, according to the Hebrew; therefore it was called the
mina according to those things previously determined by me above. But since it
was impossible, if the large silver (mina) was carried about, to buy bread or
anything else of small value, it was necessary to give the large silver (minas)
to the money-changers and to change (them) for small coins, that is to say, to
change (the money), that is, to make exchange. Hence those called <i>trapezitai </i>are
also called money-changers. Therefore also the Lord, overturning their tables
there, scattered their silver (minas). For this reason also there came about the
name of the obolus, because by means of such little arrows as these the business
of the wars of mankind was carried on.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C55"></A>55.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the <i>xestes. </i>But the name of the <i>xestes </i>is from
the great measures divided into small parts. Because some have sought <A NAME="p66"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|66</SPAN></A>
to learn {71c} whence this measure is derived and have not found out, we have
assented with some of the ancients as to whence this derived (term) is taken.
Contrariwise it is Greek,<A HREF="#451"><SUP>451</SUP></A> from the circumstance that by means of
it large measures are reduced <A HREF="#452"><SUP>452</SUP></A> to smallness. The Romans, taking
over its name, inasmuch as they had a measure of 6 <i>xestai, </i>which (number)
is pronounced by them in the Roman language <i>sex, </i>say therefore not <i>xestes
</i>but <i>sextan, </i><A HREF="#453"><SUP>453</SUP></A><i> </i>that is, &quot;six times,&quot; a
multiple of the <i>xestes.</i><A HREF="#454"><SUP>454</SUP></A><i> </i>They also call the little <i>xestes
</i>the <i>sexton </i><A HREF="#455"><SUP>455</SUP></A>  for it is the sixth part of what is called
among them the <i>congiarium.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C56"></A>56.</SPAN>&nbsp;But the <i>congiarium </i><A HREF="#456"><SUP>456</SUP></A>
is a liquid measure among
the Romans also. For likewise the name is even pronounced in the Roman fashion.
For this measure you have the further evidence of the <i>Chronicle </i>of
Eusebius and the other chroniclers, (relating) that as each of the kings in
(his) time (bestowed) gifts upon the Roman populace, they accordingly bestowed good cheer. {71d} It is to be interpreted &quot;coiled
up&quot; <A HREF="#457"><sup>457</sup></A><sup> </sup>or &quot;put together,&quot; for the Roman <i>conge
</i><A HREF="#458"><SUP>458</SUP></A>  means &quot;assemble&quot; or &quot;put together.&quot;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C57"></A>57.</SPAN>&nbsp;No one of those who have met with these weights and measures which
have been mentioned by us for the second time can find fault, as though the
writing were without purpose instead of to teach accuracy; for although we spoke
of them heretofore somewhat briefly, we have now set down for the sake of
accuracy those things also that had been abbreviated. Hereafter we shall tell
about land measures and the measurements upon the land, for they also are in the
divine Scripture. <A NAME="p67"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|67</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C58"></A>58.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the field. The field <A HREF="#459"><SUP>459</SUP></A> is a land measure.
Now roughly and generically the entire earth is called a field. For if we say,
&quot;The field offers pasturage,&quot; it means that the whole world together
is green with vegetation. But again, the field is also a measure of land. And
you <A HREF="#460"><SUP>460</SUP></A> find in the divine Scripture, O lover of the good, about the
field of Abiezer.<A HREF="#461"><SUP>461</SUP></A> And it consists of 5 or 6 seahs,<A HREF="#462"><SUP>462</SUP></A>
so that it is either a {72a} fifth or a sixth of a <i>jugon. </i>But this is an Egyptian measure,
for the Egyptians measure all their land in fields.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C59"></A>59.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the <i>jugum.</i><A HREF="#463"><SUP>463</SUP></A><i> </i>And there are 6 fields in
a <i>jugon </i>of land of the second class, but 5 (in land) of the first class.
But among the Romans <i>jugum </i>means &quot;pair&quot; or &quot;yoke,&quot;
because it is the plowing of a yoke of oxen for a whole day; for the same reason
also (we find) the decad <A HREF="#464"><SUP>464</SUP></A> in the agriculture of the Palestinians
and Arabians. But among the Cyprians they are called <i>zyga,</i><A HREF="#465"><SUP>465</SUP></A><i> </i>and
among other peoples <i>syntelesmata.</i><A HREF="#466"><SUP>466</SUP></A><i> </i>There is in the field,
according to the measure of the measuring rod of 6 2/3 cubits, called among
surveyors the <i>akaina, </i>20 by 20 (rods). For the field consists of 5 <i>plethra
</i>of land of the first class, but of 6 <i>plethra </i>of the second class.
[The measure of the field <A HREF="#467"><sup>467</sup></A><sup>&nbsp; <A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A></sup>
is not like ours, for it extends 20 (rods) by 20 according to the reckoning
of 5 cubits (to the rod).] But the <i>plethron </i>is 20 <A HREF="#468"><SUP>468</SUP></A>
by 20
cubits, called the <i>sataean </i><A HREF="#469"><SUP>469</SUP></A>  among the Palestinians and
Arabians. For 30 <i>sataeans </i>constitute a <i>jugon </i>of land {72b} of the first class.
Therefore, just as the quantity of 30 <i>modii </i>like that in the Gospel <A HREF="#470"><SUP>470</SUP></A>
is called a kor, so also here the 30 <i>sataeans </i>are called a <i>koraean. </i>But
a <i>koraean </i>of land of the second class has 60 <i>sataeans </i>in [the
measure. And, again, in measurements upon the land the <i>sataean </i>has 6 cabs
<A HREF="#471"><SUP>471</SUP></A> in] it. But these 30 <A HREF="#472"><SUP>472</SUP></A>
<i>sataeans </i>are 13 <i>jugera</i>----like
the one-fifth of the measure among the Palestinians <A HREF="#473"><SUP>473</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>----that is, 13
yokes. For the Romans say <i>junge </i>for &quot;yoke up,&quot; since a yoke of
oxen will plow 2 1/3 <i>sataeans </i>in a day. You inquire as to the measure of
the land, is it thus? <A HREF="#474"><SUP>474</SUP></A> You inquire as to the measure of the seed,
as it thus?<sup>488</sup> For, the structure of the <i>modius </i>being
enlarged, the overflow, that is, the overfulness of the <i>modius, </i>constituted
a part <A HREF="#475"><SUP>475</SUP></A> of the <i>modius. </i>Therefore when the <i>modius </i>is
small <A HREF="#476"><SUP>476</SUP></A> it consists of 5 cabs, but when it is spacious it consists
of 6. Therefore also the <i>sataean </i>consists of 6 cabs in the measurement of
land, and of 6 cabs (consists) the measure of seed. {72c} And we have told
the things concerning the <i>sataean, </i>the <i>plethron, </i>the yoke, the <i>jugon,
</i>the <i>koraean, </i>the field, and the <i>jugera.</i></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C60"></A>60.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning the cubit. And this also is in the divine Scriptures <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A>
in many places. For it is said that the specifications of the ark of Noah
were given by means of cubits. For it was said: &quot;Thou shalt make it 300
cubits long, 30 cubits high, and 50 cubits wide, and within a cubit thou shalt
gather it together above.&quot; <A HREF="#477"><SUP>477</SUP></A> The cubit then is a measure, but
it is taken from the measure of the forearm.<A HREF="#478"><SUP>478</SUP></A> For the part from the
elbow to the wrist and the palm of the hand is called the cubit, the middle
finger of the cubit measure being also extended at the same time and there being
added below (it) the span, that is, of the hand, taken all together.<A HREF="#479"><SUP>479</SUP></A>
This cubit has 24 fingers <A HREF="#480"><SUP>480</SUP></A> in the measure, if the cubit is {72d} a linear measure. If, however, it be
<i><span class="Greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03B3;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span></i>,<i>
</i>which is measured along two sides, it is of 48 fingers.<A HREF="#481"><SUP>481</SUP></A> When
employed in measuring a round piece of timber, when doubled four times it is
called a solid cubit and is of 192 fingers.<A HREF="#482"><SUP>482</SUP></A> But in this usage the
finger contains 8 <i>lepta. </i>The measure of a piece of timber, however, is
taken from the circumference of the timber. For example, if you wind a cord
about the piece of timber and it is found that there are in it 72 fingers, or as
many as there may be, then you multiply the 72 fingers by 72 again, which makes
5,184 fingers. You divide these again by 12, and there are 432 fingers.<A HREF="#483"><SUP>483</SUP></A>
You take the length of such a piece of timber, whether its length be 10 or 12,
or whatever it may be. If it be 10 cubits, you multiply the 432 <i>lepta </i>by
these 10, and there are 4,320 <i>lepta. </i>Then you divide these by 192, and
they make 20 solid cubits, which are 3,840 {73a} <i>lepta, </i>that is to say, fingers.
And there yet remain 480 <i>lepta, </i>of which the 1/192<i> </i>part makes 2
cubits, which is 384 <i>lepta, </i>and there remain 96 <i>lepta.</i><A HREF="#484"><SUP>484</SUP></A><i> </i>Then,
since it does not have <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A> another measure of 192, so that it might be reckoned a solid cubit, we now
divide the fingers which remain into <i>lepta. </i>Then since a finger contains
8 <i>lepta,</i><A HREF="#485"><SUP>485</SUP></A>  one-eighth of these 96 <i>lepta </i>that remain
makes the number 12, which is 12 fingers, making half a cubit.<A HREF="#486"><SUP>486</SUP></A> So
there are, in a piece of timber that is 72 fingers in circumference and 10
cubits long, 22 solid cubits and 12 fingers, that is, 22 1/2 (solid) cubits.<A HREF="#487"><SUP>487</SUP></A>
But the simple cubit of linear measurement contains 3 spans,<A HREF="#488"><SUP>488</SUP></A> 6
hands,<A HREF="#489"><SUP>489</SUP></A><sup> </sup>or 4 palms.<A HREF="#490"><SUP>490</SUP></A> And there are 8 fingers in the
span and 4 fingers in the hand. {73b} But when it is closed it is called the
fist. It is, however, often also called the <i>gronthos,</i><A HREF="#491"><SUP>491</SUP></A><i> </i>inasmuch
as athletes use this form when engaging in a fight. Therefore the apostle says:
&quot;Thus I fight, not as if I beat the air.&quot; <A HREF="#492"><SUP>492</SUP></A> For what is
called the palm is employed as a measure by women in making fabrics for
clothing. For they stretch out the fingers from the tip of the nail of the
middle finger to the &quot;breast&quot; of the palm of the hand, that is, to the
great joint, and there are six fingers in it. This is the account of the cubit,
the span, the hand, the finger, and the palm. And to this point is concerning
measurements on the earth by means of which land is measured which are employed
in the Scriptures. But I have also told about the measurement of round timbers,
although it is not employed in the divine Scripture. <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

Edom<A HREF="#536"><SUP>536</SUP></A> in the Scripture. But in the Greek language it is called the
Rock. You also have this name in Isaiah, who says: &quot;And the Rock shall be
desolate,&quot; but in (some) codices: &quot;The Rock shall be desolate.&quot;<A HREF="#537"><SUP>537</SUP></A>
For it is not in regard to a rock that the divine Scripture says, &quot;it is
desolate,&quot; as many mistakenly think, but in regard to that which we have
indicated. And it is situated in Mount Seir; often it also is called Seir, for
it had these names from Esau, because he built it. For he was named Esau because
of ruddiness of countenance, {74d} Seir because of hairiness,<A HREF="#538"><SUP>538</SUP></A> Edom
because of gluttony and worldliness, because he sold his birthright in exchange
for food. But the inhabitant of the (region) round about is called, along with
it, Edom.</p>

&quot;near Salim,&quot; where John <A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A> was baptizing in the Gospel of John. And the place, moreover, is to be seen
to this day, eight miles south of Bajshan, near Salim and the Jordan.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C73"></A>73.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning Bethel.] Bethel <A HREF="#540"><SUP>540</SUP></A> is even today a village,
ten miles distant from Elia as you go to Neapolis, on the right hand of the way,
(a village) which of old was called @@@ <A HREF="#541"><SUP>541</SUP></A> and Luz. It is also of
the tribe of Benjamin, near Bethau <A HREF="#542"><SUP>542</SUP></A> and Ai. And Joshua besieged it,
killing its king.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C74"></A>74.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning Jerusalem.] (As for) Jerusalem, of it Adonibezek was
king,<A HREF="#543"><SUP>543</SUP></A> and afterward the Jebusites, by {75a} whom it was called
Jebus. When David had driven them out <A HREF="#544"><SUP>544</SUP></A> he made it a priestly
metropolis of Judah because of the temple that was established in it. Josephus
says that this is the Salem of Genesis over which Melchizedek was king.<A HREF="#545"><SUP>545</SUP></A>
And it was in the portion of the tribe <A HREF="#546"><SUP>546</SUP></A> of Benjamin. But others say
that the Salem of Melchizedek was opposite Shechem in Samaria, whose grounds are
seen (lying) waste. For Eusebius also, who wrote the <i>Onomasticon,</i><A HREF="#547"><sup>547</sup></A>
so testifies, saying: &quot;Salem is the city of Shechem, which is Shechem,<A HREF="#548"><SUP>548</SUP></A>
as the Scripture says. But there is also another village to this day beside
Elia, to the west of it. And there is yet another situated in a plain eight
miles from Bajshan (the village), of Salumia. But Josephus says that this is the
Salem over which Melchizedek was king, saying: 'Salem is that which was later
Jerusalem.' &quot;<A HREF="#549"><SUP>549</SUP></A> But some say {75b} that there is another Salem
near Hobah,<A HREF="#550"><SUP>550</SUP></A> to the left of Damascus. <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C75"></A>75.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning Jafo.] Jafo, which is transferred (into Greek as) Jope,
is a city of Palestine on the seacoast in the portion of Dan.<A HREF="#551"><sup>551</sup></A><sup> </sup>But
today many of its buildings are in ruins. Here Jonah the prophet embarked for
Tarshish,<A HREF="#552"><SUP>552</SUP></A> which is called Tarsus above.<A HREF="#553"><SUP>553</SUP></A> And here
they of Judea were accustomed to embark----I mean, from Jope----for it was their
port.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C76"></A>76.</SPAN>&nbsp;Akko,<A HREF="#554"><SUP>554</SUP></A> which is Ptolemais and Thimuna,<A HREF="#555"><SUP>555</SUP></A>
beside great Carmel, was also the harbor of Jamnia <A HREF="#556"><SUP>556</SUP></A>
and the port
for Betosigon.<sup><A HREF="#557">557</A> </sup>But it is now laid waste. From here, again, they
say Jonah, having been vomited up by the whale, departed on the way to Nineveh,
the great city, for forty days. For thus it is in the Hebrew: &quot;Jonah began
to enter the city forty days.&quot; <A HREF="#558"><SUP>558</SUP></A> But it is not possible that
the city could have had a street of forty days' (length), but it is also
impossible that Jonah could have sat by it forty days {75c} until he saw what was going
to take place; for so do the followers of Aquila interpret: &quot;Again forty
days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&quot;<A HREF="#559"><SUP>559</SUP></A> Where then did Jonah
tarry, so that he knew that it was not yet overthrown? Or while the sun beat
down upon his head with heat, the gourd from which he had shade rising up over
his head? And if he waited for forty days while it shaded him from the heat, why
did he say: &quot;It sprang up one night and withered another,&quot;<A HREF="#560"><SUP>560</SUP></A>
if he persevered for forty days looking for what was to take place? So the
seventy-two have well translated: &quot;Yet three days and Nineveh shall be
overthrown.&quot;<A HREF="#561"><SUP>561</SUP></A> For they have explained that what is involved in
the <A NAME="p77"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|77</SPAN></A> forty days is said of the journey, as we think. And when they have explained
it as the measure of the length of the journey, they have resolved the
difficulty of the words and have explained the note about the three days.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C77"></A>77.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning Karm<sup>e</sup>la. Karm<sup>e</sup>la, {75d} where Nabal was,<A HREF="#562"><SUP>562</SUP></A>
is a village that is even yet called Karm<sup>e</sup>la, which is transferred
(into Greek as) Karmelos, toward the east from the tenth milestone on the road
from Hebron, where there is also situated a fort of the Romans.<A HREF="#563"><SUP>563</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C78"></A>78.</SPAN>&nbsp;Concerning another second Karm<sup>e</sup>la. The other Karm<sup>e</sup>la
is the great mountain that reaches to the sea of Phoenicia and separates
Palestine from Phoenicia; (it is) where Elijah sat.<A HREF="#564"><SUP>564</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C79"></A>79.</SPAN>&nbsp;[Concerning Karchedon.] Karchedon,<A HREF="#565"><SUP>565</SUP></A> which is Carthage,
also Carthagina, the metropolis of Africa. Thither once upon a time Canaanites
migrated from Phoenicia. For even until today the Africans speak Canaanitish.
And being asked about their language, they reply: &quot;We are Canaanites.&quot;
But they are called Bizakanoi,<A HREF="#566"><SUP>566</SUP></A> which is translated
&quot;scattered.&quot; But because of their racial relationship to the Phoenicians, Isaiah says to the king of Tyre: &quot;Till thy land,
{76a} for the ships of Karchedon no longer come to thee.&quot;<A HREF="#567"><SUP>567</SUP></A> But
in the Hebrew Isaiah and Ezekiel call it Tarshish.<A HREF="#568"><SUP>568</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C80"></A>80.</SPAN>&nbsp;[As to the quarters (of the heavens) and the stars which are in the
divine Scriptures.] Again, O lover of the good, I also prepare you an account of
the quarters (of the heavens) and of the stars which are in the divine
Scriptures. East, west, north, south, according to the word spoken by the Lord
in the Gospel, shall come and lean on the bosom of Abraham and of Isaac and of
Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the sons of the kingdom----as we would say,
the sons of <A NAME="p78"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|78</SPAN></A> Israel----shall go out into outer darkness.<A HREF="#569"><SUP>569</SUP></A> But some one may
say: &quot;You have told us something superfluous in speaking of east and west
and north and south, for who does not know these terms and the local
significance <A HREF="#570"><SUP>570</SUP></A> of them?&quot; But I have called them to mind that I
might explain their origin. Now it will occur to you at once, O lover of the
good, concerning Job, that &quot;he was a highborn man of those from the (region
of the) rising of the sun.&quot; <A HREF="#571"><SUP>571</SUP></A> So the east,<A HREF="#572"><sup>572</sup></A><sup> </sup>{76b}
where the sun rises, gets its name accordingly. But if the highborn and the
lowborn are known by birth,<A HREF="#573"><SUP>573</SUP></A> Job was exceedingly highborn. For he
was the son of Zerah, and Zerah was the son of Reuel, and Reuel was the son of
Esau,<A HREF="#574"><SUP>574</SUP></A> Esau was the son of Isaac, Isaac was the son of Abraham, he
(Job) being the fifth after Abraham, that is, from Abraham. He (Abraham) was
above all nobility of birth,<A HREF="#575"><SUP>575</SUP></A> he who was known as the friend of
God.<A HREF="#576"><SUP>576</SUP></A> For if the friends of kings <A HREF="#577"><SUP>577</SUP></A>
are known as
highborn, how much more highborn was Abraham, who was named &quot;the friend of
God&quot;?<A HREF="#578"><SUP>578</SUP></A> But from the east also the easterly wind is called <i>euros,
</i>either because it blows widely <A HREF="#579"><SUP>579</SUP></A> or because it is set at the
<A NAME="p79"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|79</SPAN></A> head <A HREF="#580"><SUP>580</SUP></A> of the winds, that is, is found (at the head). Hence, in
the Acts of the Apostles also there is found knowledge of the wind <i>euraklydon </i>{76c} and
<i>typhonikos,</i><A HREF="#581"><SUP>581</SUP></A><i> typhonikos </i>because
of severity, but <i>euraklydon</i><A HREF="#582"><SUP>582</SUP></A><i> </i>because it blows out of the
depths of <i>euros.</i><A HREF="#583"><SUP>583</SUP></A><i> </i>But there is also in the Scripture
concerning the <i>apeliotes.</i><A HREF="#584"><SUP>584</SUP></A><i> </i>This blows from the other side of
<i>euros, </i>from the quarter of <i>notos </i><A HREF="#585"><SUP>585</SUP></A><i> </i>over which the sun
passes, hence called <i>apeliotes.</i><A HREF="#586"><SUP>586</SUP></A><i> </i>And beyond it is <i>euronotos,
</i>because it is in the middle between <i>euros </i>and <i>notos, </i>after <i>apeliotes,
</i>as this wind also is called in the divine Scriptures.<A HREF="#587"><SUP>587</SUP></A> But <i>notos
</i>is the wind that blows from the south;<A HREF="#588"><SUP>588</SUP></A> and after this there is
another wind that is called <i>libonotos, </i>for it is in the middle between <i>notos
</i>and <i>lips.</i><A HREF="#589"><SUP>589</SUP></A><i> </i>The west is also called
<i>hespera,</i><A HREF="#590"><SUP>590</SUP></A><i>
</i>from which quarter <i>zephyros </i>blows. You have this wind also in the
Acts.<A HREF="#591"><SUP>591</SUP></A> And in the middle between <i>lips </i>and <i>zephyros </i>blows
that which is called the &quot;middle,&quot; otherwise <i>choros, </i>which is
likewise found in the Acts,<A HREF="#592"><SUP>592</SUP></A> where the companions of
Paul sailed for the place Phoenix, {76d} the harbor of which Phoenix looked
toward the <i>choros. </i>From this <i>choros </i>blow the annuals <A HREF="#593"><SUP>593</SUP></A>
that are also called &quot;dogs,&quot; but they are called &quot;dogs&quot;
because of the perpetual barking of dogs. The north wind, which is called <i>aparkias,
</i>blows from <A NAME="p80"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|80</SPAN></A> the depths of the north, whence that which is called the bear
<A HREF="#594"><SUP>594</SUP></A>
turns; therefore it is called <i>aparktias.</i><A HREF="#595"><SUP>595</SUP></A><i> </i>Beyond this is that
which is called the <i>thraskion,</i><A HREF="#596"><SUP>596</SUP></A><i> </i>which blows from the region
of Thrace. Men give this wind many names, naming them from the places (whence
they blow). The <i>thraskion </i>and the <i>euraklydon </i>are associated with
each other. And some of those in the East call the <i>euraklydon </i>the <i>skopelea,</i><A HREF="#597"><SUP>597</SUP></A><i>
</i>and the <i>thraskion </i>the <i>patrea.</i><A HREF="#598"><SUP>598</SUP></A><i> </i>But others call the <i>thraskion
</i>the <i>kekian,</i><A HREF="#599"><SUP>599</SUP></A><i> </i>while those in Numidia, in Africa, and in
Britain call it the <i>samuren.</i><A HREF="#600"><SUP>600</SUP></A><i> </i>And these things pertain to
the four quarters and their winds and the two (winds) blowing with each one of
the winds, situated on the two sides of each.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C81"></A>81.</SPAN>&nbsp;{77a} Mary went up to the hill country to (visit) Elizabeth.<A HREF="#601"><SUP>601</SUP></A>
And this hill country extends upward from the Aulon (valley) and Jericho and the
Dead Sea, and on the other side of Jericho it extends upward from the Jordan to
the neighborhood of parts of Phoenicia. Here, then, are established <A HREF="#602"><SUP>602</SUP></A>
the boundaries <A HREF="#603"><SUP>603</SUP></A> of Israel and (her) possessions,<A HREF="#604"><SUP>604</SUP></A>
Abilene and the Decapolis, which are on the side of Pella.<A HREF="#605"><SUP>605</SUP></A><sup> </sup>But
they are also situated in the region of Perea.<A HREF="#606"><SUP>606</SUP></A> And to them also
belong the Ammonite (country) and the Moabite (country) and the <A NAME="p81"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|81</SPAN></A>
Gileadite (country) above.<A HREF="#607"><SUP>607</SUP></A> Now they are eastward across the
Jordan, but the hill country is westward of the Jordan, Jerusalem being in the
midst of it. But to the west of the east<A HREF="#608"><SUP>608</SUP></A> it has the Shephelah. In
the Shephelah were the five satrapies of the foreign tribes:<A HREF="#609"><SUP>609</SUP></A>
(that of) the Gazans, (named) from the city of Gaza; (that of) the Ashkelonians,
from the city of Ashkelon; (that of) the Azotans----these were on the sea. But
there was also that of the Gathans, whence Goliath was; but Gath is now laid waste. {77b} But it extended to Ekron. And there is
now a large desolate village not far from Gath, about seven miles. Some think
this to be Ekron, but from the positions and from the signs and from (the
location of) Mount Carmel we find it to be Caesarea Stratonis.<A HREF="#610"><SUP>610</SUP></A>
This whole country, however, was called @@, and from its name of @@ the whole
eparchy <A HREF="#611"><SUP>611</SUP></A> came to be called Palestine. And so much for these things.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C82"></A>82.</SPAN>&nbsp;But there are also in Job these things about the position of the stars,<A HREF="#612"><SUP>612</SUP></A>
where he says: &quot;He that made the Pleiades and the evening star and the
North Star and Orion and the chambers of the south.&quot;<A HREF="#613"><SUP>613</SUP></A><sup> </sup>And the
Pleiades, with the seven stars in it, is known to many. But some call it the
Cluster<A HREF="#614"><SUP>614</SUP></A> because of its resemblance to a cluster (of grapes). And
the evening star is the star that is seen in the west at evening time, but especially in the autumn season. They call this {77c} the
long-haired.<A HREF="#615"><SUP>615</SUP></A> Moreover, O lover of the good, you have written in
Job concerning this: &quot;For thou callest,&quot; he says, &quot;the evening
star with the voice, and he answers thee; but thou leadest him, taking hold <A NAME="p82"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|82</SPAN></A>
of his hair.&quot;<A HREF="#616"><SUP>616</SUP></A> But as to the North Star, some say that it
is the foremost star in the pole of Charles's Wain,<A HREF="#617"><SUP>617</SUP></A> but others say
that it is one of the four (constituting) the wagon itself, that is, the corner
one at the wagon end of the pole. But as to Orion, they say that it is the one
formed in the likeness of a man's image. And it has four (principal) stars
forming a rectangle, and three above like a head, and three like a girdle for
the loins, and others that descend in the form of a belt or like a sword. But
these are called <i>mazuroth </i><A HREF="#618"><SUP>618</SUP></A>  in the divine Scripture; they
are, however, interpreted &quot;elements.&quot; The (term) &quot;chambers of the
south&quot; is used because of the storehouses of snow and of hail and dew.
These are not on the earth, but between the heavens and the earth, being brought from the inside {77d} of the corners of the heavens; and
dew and honey especially are drops that have been thus brought from heaven. For
it is not true, as some suppose, that the rain is from heaven. Out of the sea
and other places the clouds draw up the rain and pour (it) upon the face of the
earth. And you have testimony, O lover of the good, in the prophet,<A HREF="#619"><SUP>619</SUP></A>
where he says: &quot;He that bringeth up the clouds from the end of the
earth,&quot; and, again: &quot;He that calleth the waters of the sea and poureth
them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord God Almighty is his name.&quot;<A HREF="#620"><SUP>620</SUP></A>
And so much, again, for these things.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C83"></A>83.</SPAN>&nbsp;And, other place and land names occurring to us, we are making mention of
them. Mountains and hills. Mountains, indeed, are according to nature; they <A HREF="#621"><SUP>621</SUP></A>
are elevated places that were formed by God, that were heaped up by means of
rocks and stones. And hills also are elevated places, but they are of earth <A HREF="#622"><SUP>622</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>{78a} and not
heaped up out of stones. And ridges <A HREF="#623"><SUP>623</SUP></A> are elevated places, but they
are of sand. And <A NAME="p83"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|83</SPAN></A> the <i>rasine </i><A HREF="#624"><SUP>624</SUP></A>
also are said to be of sand----not the <i>shevalte, </i><A HREF="#625"><SUP>625</SUP></A>
but the <i>rapine. </i>For the <i>shevalte </i>are in the
middle parts of streams where the movement of the stream is from both sides
toward the middle, being gathered together in the likeness of a spike (of
grain), such that because of the force of the turning about they are called
whirlpools.</p>

Bruns and Ed. Sachau, <i>Syrisch-r&ouml;misches Rechtsbuch aus dem f&uuml;nften

section refers to the Roman <i>jugum, </i>an altogether different thing.</p>
<p><A NAME="464"></A>464.&nbsp;<sup>478</sup>&nbsp;I.e., most obviously, 10 days' plowing; but this was also
perhaps the amount of land sown by 10 seahs of grain.</p>
<p><A NAME="465"></A>465.&nbsp;<sup>479</sup>&nbsp;This is the Greek margin of B, meaning primarily
&quot;yokes,&quot; and used as a synonym for the Roman <i>jugera.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="466"></A>466.&nbsp;<sup>480</sup>&nbsp;This exact form does not occur in the mss.; the Syriac of B is
<i>@@@, </i>and the Greek margin is <i>&tau;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;.
</i>The
data of both mss. make it clear that <i>syntelesmata </i>is the form lying back
of the Syriac here, as Lagarde recognized.</p>
<p><A NAME="467"></A>467.&nbsp;<sup>481</sup>&nbsp;The dimensions immediately following and the previous
reference to the use of the field as a land measure among the Egyptians make it
certain that the field here mentioned is the Egyptian. Cf. A. H. Gardiner, <i>Egyptian
Grammar </i>(Oxford, 1927) p. 200.</p>
<p><A NAME="468"></A>468.&nbsp;<sup>482</sup>&nbsp;This first number must mean rods, since there are 5 <i>plethra
</i>in a field; if taken as cubits in both cases, there would be 25 <i>plethra </i>in
a field. Hultsch, <i>Gr. und r&ouml;m. Metrologie, </i>p. 599, now reads 60 by 60
cubits as the meaning of the fragments in Lagarde, <i>Symmicta </i>I 218 f.; and
this agrees practically with what we have just said about the Syriac text. Bar
Bahlul, <i>Lexicon Syriacum </i>(ed. R. Duval) col. 1576, line 3, calls the <i>plethron </i>a <i>
jugum. </i>Does he mean in Palestine?</p>
<p><A NAME="469"></A>469.&nbsp;<sup>483</sup>&nbsp;I.e., a land measure corresponding to the seah as a
measure of seed; the Syriac and Greek have an adjectival form here. The term <i>koraean
</i>below has the same explanation.</p>
<p><A NAME="470"></A>470.&nbsp;<sup>484</sup>&nbsp;The <i>modius </i>is mentioned in Matt. 5:15; Mark 4:21;
Luke 11:33.</p>
<p><A NAME="471"></A>471.&nbsp;<sup>485</sup> As the square brackets indicate, the word does not occur in A;

<p><A NAME="473"></A>473.&nbsp;<sup>487</sup>&nbsp; &#x00A7; 58 has called the seah or <i>sataean </i>one-fifth of

<p><A NAME="481"></A>481.&nbsp;<sup>495</sup>&nbsp;I.e., Epiphanius measures 24 fingers along one side of
the quadrangle and 24 fingers along another side, then takes their sum.</p>
<p><A NAME="482"></A>482.&nbsp;<sup>496</sup>&nbsp;Epiphanius seems to think of a cubic block, around which
he makes two complete measurements, each of them amounting to 96 fingers.</p>
<p><A NAME="483"></A>483.&nbsp;<sup>497</sup>&nbsp;The significance of this last figure can only be the area
of a cross-section of the piece of timber, and that would be 412+ units, if the
circumference be 72---- not very exact calculation.</p>
<p><A NAME="484"></A>484.&nbsp;<sup>498</sup>&nbsp;The only reason for this second division is that the
science of mathematics was not far advanced in the author's day, and he must
divide by successive subtractions.</p>
<p><A NAME="485"></A>485.&nbsp;<sup>499</sup>&nbsp;I.e., the term <i>lepta </i>seems to be preferred when
speaking of cubic fingers, but the author is not consistent in his usage.</p>
<p><A NAME="486"></A>486.&nbsp;<sup>500</sup>&nbsp;Only in linear measure; has the author forgotten he is
dealing with cubic measure? But it is a fact that the 96 is half of his solid
cubit.</p>
<p><A NAME="487"></A>487.&nbsp;<sup>501</sup> A result far from accurate. Since 18 fingers are a cubit, 324
square fingers are a square cubit, and the area of a cross-section of this piece
of timber would be, according to a previous calculation, 412/324 square cubits.
This fraction multiplied by 10 gives as a result 12 2/3 solid cubits.</p>

@@@ and LXX <i>&pi;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&alpha;.

find Rekem or Rokom as the name of one of the kings of Midian, from whom the
city of Rekem was named according to Josephus <i>(Antiquities </i>IV vii 1). Cf.
Eusebius, <i>op. cit. </i>p. 144.</p>
<p><A NAME="534"></A>534.&nbsp;<sup>548</sup>&nbsp;B makes no distinction in the two spellings of Rekem, but
A has a point beneath in the first instance and a point above in the second.
This may be intended to indicate the vocalization Rekem in the first place, and
Rekom or Rokom in the second, following Eusebius, <i>op. cit. </i>p. 144, lines
7 f. It is a curious fact that the Lee edition of the Peshitta has this point
beneath only in three places where it stands for MT Kadesh (Gen. 14:7; 16:14;
20:1), while there is no hint as to the vocalization elsewhere; the Urmia and
Mosul editions uniformly point R<sup>e</sup>kem.</p>
<p><A NAME="535"></A>535.&nbsp;<sup>549</sup>&nbsp;The name Rekem per se does not occur in Isaiah in MT or
LXX; so Josh. 13:21 may be meant. Joshua makes Rekem one of the chiefs of
Midian, the same mentioned in Num. 31:8. Josh. 18:27 refers to a city of
Benjamin which could hardly be confused with Petra. Dalman <i>(Neue
Petra-Forschungen </i>[Leipzig, 1912] p. 14) suggests that the identification of
Sela<sup>c</sup> with Rekem may have arisen through the use of a compound name
Sela<sup>c</sup>-Rekem to designate the most conspicuous outpost of the ancient
Edomite capital. MT has the name Rekem also in I Chron. 2:43-44 and 7:16; but it

<p><A NAME="624"></A>624.&nbsp;<sup>639</sup>&nbsp;The only meaning given by the lexicons is
&quot;rivulets.&quot; The marginal Greek readings seem to be confused, and <i>&theta;&iota;&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;,
</i>&quot;sand heaps&quot; or &quot;dunes,&quot; seems to belong to this word
rather than to <i>shevalte. </i>B does not definitely attach <i>&theta;&iota;&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;
</i>to
a particular word of the text.</p>
<p><A NAME="625"></A>625.&nbsp;<sup>640</sup>&nbsp;The primary meaning of this word in the singular is
&quot;spike (of grain),&quot; but it seems also to mean &quot;flood&quot; (Ps. 69:3,16 MT; Isa. 27:12 MT and P). The marginal
<i>&delta;&iota;&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;, </i>&quot;whirlpools&quot;
or &quot;eddies,&quot; seems to belong to this word.</p>
<p><A NAME="626"></A>626.&nbsp;<sup>641</sup>1 am venturing thus to vocalize in accordance with the same
consonants in R. Payne Smith, <i>Thesaurus Syriacus, </i>col. 2615.</p>
<p><A NAME="627"></A>627.&nbsp;<sup>642</sup>&nbsp;Cf. <i>ibid. </i>col. 1264.</p>
<p><A NAME="628"></A>628.&nbsp;<sup>643</sup>&nbsp;Perhaps an adjective built on the city name Heftun; cf.
R. Payne Smith, <i>op. cit. </i>col. 1349.</p>
<p><A NAME="629"></A>629.&nbsp;<sup>644</sup>&nbsp;For the entire colophon cf. W. Wright, <i>Catalogue of
Syriac Manuscripts in the British Museum </i>II (London, 1871) 718a. Wright
makes out some letters hardly legible in our photograph. B has no corresponding
colophon.</p>
