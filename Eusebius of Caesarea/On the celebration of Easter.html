<h3 align=center>On the
Celebration of the <i>Pascha</i></h3>

<p align=center>[Translated by Andrew Eastbourne]</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;It would
perhaps not be inappropriate here again to discuss the <i>Pascha</i>, which was handed down long ago<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>
to the children of the Hebrews as an image.&nbsp; Now then, when the Hebrews,
performing &quot;shadows of things to come,&quot;<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>
first used to celebrate the festival of <i>Phasek</i>,<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>
they would take for themselves a young domestic animal (this was a lamb or a
sheep<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>).&nbsp;
Next, they would sacrifice this animal themselves; and then, with the blood,
everyone would first anoint the lintels and door-posts of their own homes,
bloodying the thresholds and houses to ward off the destroyer.<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>&nbsp;
The flesh of the lamb, on the other hand, they would use for food; and girding
up their loins with a belt, partaking of the nourishment of unleavened bread,
and serving themselves bitter herbs, they would &quot;pass over&quot; from one
place to another&#8212;[meaning,] the [journey] from the land of Egypt to the
wilderness.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>&nbsp;
It had been enjoined by Law that they do this, along with the slaughter and
eating of the lamb.&nbsp; Hence, the passing over out of Egypt produced<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a>
for them the name of the &quot;Passover.&quot;<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a>&nbsp;
But these things happened to <i>them</i>
by way of a <i>type</i>; and they were
written down for <i>our</i> sake.<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Indeed, Paul [implicitly] gives this interpretation, revealing the truth of the
ancient symbols, when he says, &quot;For indeed, Christ our <i>Pascha</i> has been sacrificed.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And the reason for his being sacrificed is presented by the Baptist, when he
says, &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>&nbsp;
The Savior's body,<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a>
you see, was handed over to death as a sacrificial victim to ward off all
evils:&nbsp; In the manner of a purificatory ritual, it took away the sin of the
whole world.&nbsp; That is why Isaiah cried out clearly, &quot;This one bears our
sins, and suffers pain on our behalf.&quot;<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"
title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;When we
are nourished by the <i>rational<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> flesh</i>
of this sacrificial Savior,<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a>
who rescued the entire human race by his own blood&#8212;that is, when we are
nourished by his teachings and discourses, which announce the kingdom of
heaven&#8212;then we are rightly luxuriating with the luxury<a href="#_ftn16"
name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>
that is in accordance with God.&nbsp; But in addition to this, when we mark the
houses of our <i>souls</i>, that is, our
bodies, by faith in his blood, which he gave as a ransom in exchange for our
salvation, we drive away from ourselves every kind of treacherous demon.&nbsp; And
when we celebrate the &quot;Passover&quot; festival, we are training ourselves
to pass over to divine things, just as in ancient times they passed over out of
Egypt into the desert.&nbsp; Indeed, in this way, we too are setting out on a kind
of path that is untraversed and left deserted by the many, putting out of our
souls the ancient &quot;leaven&quot; of godless error; and we serve ourselves
&quot;bitter herbs&quot; by means of a bitter and painful way of life.</p>

<p>The
appointed time for the festival is well-timed too:&nbsp; It did not come along in
the midst of the winter season&#8212;for that time is gloomy&#8212;nor yet did it
correspond to the middle of summer, when the sweltering solstice takes away the
beauty of those who spend their time in the fields, and the length of the hours
is too greedy, not balanced with equal shares.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a>
the sight of the autumnal equinox is not pleasing, as the countryside is then
bereft and deprived of its characteristic fruits, as though of its children.&nbsp;
What is left is spring, the radiant season that takes the lead as head of the
year, like the head of the body, when the sun is just now traversing the first
section [of the Zodiac], and the moon likewise, with its light full, is
shifting its nightly course into bright day.&nbsp; This season relieves the terrors
of winter-storm thunders, removes the long intervals of time,<a href="#_ftn19"
name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>
adjusts the floods of water;<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
and now, as the fresh fair weather shines forth, calmness settles the seas for
the sailors and grants land-travellers a mild atmosphere; in this season, the
countryside is pregnant with seeds in the fields, and the plants swelling with
fruit, exulting in the gifts of God, provide to farmers the due returns for
their toil, with blessings.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;This is
the appointed time for the festival.&nbsp; To the Egyptians, the friends of demons,
it brought destruction, but to the Hebrews, who celebrate the festival in God's
honor, it brought freedom from evils.&nbsp; This very time was that one which was
observed at the original creation<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>
of the universe, when the earth sprouted plants, when the luminaries came into
existence, when heaven and earth were brought onto the scene, and all that is
in them.&nbsp; At this time, the Savior of the whole world<a href="#_ftn22"
name="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a>
accomplished the mystery of his own festival, and the &quot;great
luminary&quot; brightened the earth<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a>
with the rays of piety; indeed, this time seems to embrace<a href="#_ftn24"
name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a>
the birthday of the world.&nbsp; At this time also, the <i>type</i> was celebrated&#8212;the ancient <i>Pascha</i> which was also called Passover.&nbsp; But it also bore a
symbol&#8212;consisting of the slaughter of a lamb; and also obscurely presented an
image&#8212;that of nourishment by unleavened bread; and all these things were
fulfilled in the Savior's festival.&nbsp; For he himself was the lamb, insofar as he
was clothed with a body; he himself was also the sun of righteousness, when the
truly divine spring and the saving equinox, the turn<a href="#_ftn25"
name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a>
from worse things toward the better, took hold of human life.&nbsp; And god-driven
scourges are sent down even to this day on the demons of the Egyptians, whereas
peoples who dwell everywhere on earth are festively celebrating their freedom
from long wandering in godlessness.&nbsp; And as the deceitful spirits have ceased,
along with the storm of evils, an abundance of new fruits garlands the church
of God with various gifts of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; And simply put, the whole human
race has been changed to take up our side, and all the fields, having received
the cultivation of the soul from the <i>Logos</i>
who is the husbandman, have sprouted the seasonable flowers of virtue.&nbsp; But
also, now that we have been freed from the evils of darkness, we have been
deemed worthy of light, in the day of the knowledge of God.<a href="#_ftn26"
name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;Such are
the new teachings which in olden days were obscured through symbols, but which
have now been unveiled and brought into the light.&nbsp; And in particular, we
rekindle the beginning of the festival every year with periods of cycles.&nbsp;
Before the festival, for the sake of preparation, we take up the forty-day
training period, in emulation of the holy Moses and Elijah.&nbsp; And the festival
itself we keep renewing, unforgetful forever.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"
title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Indeed, as we set forth on our journey toward God, we bind our loins well with
the bond of self-control; we guard the steps of our soul with caution, and, as
though in sandals, we prepare for the course of our heavenly calling; we use
the staff of the divine word with the power of prayer to ward off the enemy,
and with all eagerness we pass over to the path that leads to the heavens,
hurrying from earthly affairs to heavenly things, and from mortal life to the
immortal.&nbsp; For in this way, when we have accomplished the pass-over nobly and
well, another, greater festival will greet us.&nbsp; The children of the Hebrews
call it by the name of Pentecost; it bears the image of the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;
Indeed, Moses says, &quot;When you begin [to use] the sickle on the crop, you
shall count for yourself seven sevens, and you shall present new loaves from
new crops to God.&quot;<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Now then, he was giving indications by prophetic types:&nbsp; By the
&quot;crop,&quot; he was referring to the calling of the nations; and by the
&quot;new loaves,&quot; he was referring to the souls presented to God by
Christ, the churches from the nations, in which<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a>
the greatest festival is celebrated in honor of the God who loves mankind.&nbsp; We
have been harvested by the spiritual sickles of the Apostles, and have been
gathered together into the churches everywhere in the world, as it were into
threshing-floors; we have been made into a body by a harmonious disposition of
faith, and have been prepared with the salt of teachings from the divine words;
we have been reborn through the water and fire of the Holy Spirit&#8212;and we are
presented to God by Christ, as nourishing, agreeable, and well-pleasing loaves.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;In this
way, as the prophetic symbols spoken by Moses give way to realities, with more
solemn results, we ourselves, at all events, have learned to conduct the
festival [i.e., Pentecost] with more lustre, as though we had already been
assembled together with Christ and were enjoying his kingdom.&nbsp; For this reason,
at this festival we are no longer allowed to undergo laborious toil, and we are
taught to bear the image of the rest that is hoped for in heaven.&nbsp; Hence, we do
not bend the knee as we pray, nor do we wear ourselves out with fasting; for
those who been deemed worthy of the resurrection effected by God<a
href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a>
can no longer fall down on the ground, nor can those who have been freed from
the passions have the same experience<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a>
as those who are enslaved.&nbsp; Therefore, after the <i>Pascha</i> we celebrate Pentecost, with seven complete sets of
seven [days]&#8212;after manfully completing the previous forty-day period of
training before the <i>Pascha</i> with
six sets of seven.&nbsp; For the number six relates to action and accomplishment,
and for this reason God is said to have made the universe in six days.&nbsp; The
labors in that [number six] will be quite rightly succeeded by the second
festival in seven sevens, when there is a multiplication of our rest, which the
number seven signifies symbolically.&nbsp; The number of Pentecost [i.e., 50],
however, is not complete with these [seven sevens]; overshooting the seven
sevens, it puts a seal on the all-festive day of Christ's ascension by means of
a <i>monad</i>,<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a>
the last day after these [seven sevens].<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"
title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Rightly then, as we trace out in the days of the holy Pentecost a
representation of the rest that is to come, we rejoice in soul, and rest for a
time in body, as though we were already with the bridegroom himself, and unable
to fast.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;But no
one would dispute the fact that the sacred Gospel-writers reported that the
Savior's passion took place during the days of the Jewish <i>Pascha</i> of the Unleavened Bread. &nbsp;For the
reason for the law that was proclaimed regarding the <i>Pascha</i> by Moses was as follows:&nbsp; Because the Lamb of God was
going to be led to the slaughter among the Jews themselves, and was going to
suffer this for the sake of the common salvation of all mankind at no time
other than the one now being described, God anticipated the future by means of
symbolic images, and commanded that the Jews sacrifice a physical lamb at that
very time that was going to be established at some point after the passage of
years.&nbsp; And this was performed by them every year, until the truth in its full
completeness put an end to the old images.&nbsp; Hence, from that time, the true
festival of the mysteries has held sway among the nations, whereas among the
Jews, not even the memory of the symbols themselves is preserved any longer,
since the place in which the Law had prescribed that the festival's rituals be
carried out<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a>
has been taken away from them.&nbsp; Quite rightly then does the divine Scripture of
the Gospels say that the Savior suffered at the time of the Jewish festival of
Unleavened Bread, since he was indeed at that time led as a sheep to slaughter,
in conformity with the words of prophecy.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>7.</SPAN>&nbsp;Also,
they [i.e., the Jews], following Moses, would sacrifice the sheep of the <i>Pascha</i> once in the whole year, on the
fourteenth day of the first month, at evening.&nbsp; We of the new covenant, on the
other hand, who celebrate our own <i>Pascha</i>
each Lord's day, always take our fill of the Savior's body, always partake of
the blood of the Lamb; we have always girded the loins of our souls with
chastity and self-control, we have always prepared our feet in readiness for
the Gospel;<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>
we always hold the staves in our hands, and rest on the rod that came forth
from the root of Jesse;<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a>
we are always being set free from Egypt, we are always going in search of the
wilderness of human life, we are always setting out on the journey toward God:&nbsp;
We are always celebrating the Passover.&nbsp; For the Gospel's word [/ Word] wants
us to do this, not once in the year, but always and every day.&nbsp; For this
reason, we celebrate the festival of <i>our</i>
<i>Pascha</i> every week, on the day of
our Savior and Lord, carrying out the mysteries of the true Lamb, by whom we
have been ransomed.&nbsp; And we do not circumcise our bodies with a blade&#8212;rather,
we remove every evil of the soul by means of the sharp word [/Word]; nor do we
make use of physical unleavened bread&#8212;but only the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth.&nbsp; For grace, having freed us from our former habits that had grown
old, bestowed on us the new man, the one created in accordance with God, and
the new Law, a new circumcision, a new <i>Pascha</i>,
and the &quot;Jew in secret.&quot;<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And thus, it also left us free from the old appointed times.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>8.</SPAN>&nbsp;When,
however, the emperor most beloved of God was presiding in the midst of the holy
Synod,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a>
and the question of the <i>Pascha</i>
was brought forward, there was said all that was said.&nbsp; And three [fourths] of
the bishops of the whole world had the advantage in numbers as they strove
against those of the East:&nbsp; The peoples of the North, the South, and the
Occident together, being fortified by their harmony, pulled in the opposite
direction from those of the Orient, who were defending their ancient custom.&nbsp;
But at the end of the discussion, the Orientals yielded, and thus there came to
be a single festival of Christ&#8212;and thus they stood apart from the killers of
the Lord, and were joined to those who hold the same doctrine.<a href="#_ftn39"
name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For nature draws like to like.&nbsp; And if someone were to say that it is written,
&quot;On the first day of [the festival] of Unleavened Bread the disciples
approached the Savior and said to him, 'Where do you want us to make
preparations for you to eat the <i>Pascha</i>?'&#8212;and
he sent them to such-and-such a man, bidding them to say, 'I am celebrating the
<i>Pascha</i> at your house'&quot;<a
href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a>&#8212;I
will answer that this is not a command, but a historical account of an event
that took place at the time of the Savior's passion.&nbsp; It is one thing to
recount the ancient event, and quite another to make a law and to leave behind
commands for posterity.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>9.</SPAN>&nbsp;But
furthermore, the Savior did <i>not</i>
celebrate the <i>Pascha</i> along with
the Jews at the time of his passion.&nbsp; For when they were sacrificing the lamb,
at that time he himself was conducting his own <i>Pascha</i>
with his disciples.&nbsp; They [i.e., the Jews] were doing this<a href="#_ftn41"
name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a>
on the Preparation day on which the Savior suffered; for this reason, they did
not enter the <i>praetorium</i>, but
instead Pilate came out to them.&nbsp; But he [i.e., Jesus] a full day earlier, on
the fifth day of the week, was reclining at table with his disciples, and as he
ate with them he said, &quot;I have very much desired to eat this <i>Pascha</i> with you.&quot;<a href="#_ftn42"
name="_ftnref42" title=""><sup>[42]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Do you see how the Savior did not eat the <i>Pascha</i>
along with the Jews?&nbsp; Because this was a new custom, and one foreign to the
customary Jewish ways, it was necessary for him to institute it by saying,
&quot;I have very much desired to eat this <i>Pascha</i>
with you before I suffer.&quot;&nbsp; The one set of practices, being now ancient
and indeed antiquated&#8212;the [<i>Pascha</i>]
which he used to eat along with the Jews&#8212;was <i>not</i>
desirable; but the new mystery of his new covenant, which he imparted to his
disciples, <i>was</i> desirable to him,
quite rightly so.&nbsp; Since many prophets and righteous ones before him desired to
see the mysteries of the new covenant, and since the Word himself, who thirsted
at all times for the general salvation, was passing down a mystery by which all
people would celebrate the festival, he professed that this was desirable to
him.&nbsp; The <i>Pascha</i> of Moses was not
suitable for all the nations of all time&#8212;of course not, when the Law had
stipulated that it be celebrated in a single place, namely Jerusalem.<a
href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And so it was not desirable.&nbsp; But the Savior's mystery of the new covenant is
suitable for all people, and so it was naturally desirable to him.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>10.</SPAN>&nbsp;But he
himself, before he suffered, ate the <i>Pascha</i>
and celebrated the festival with his disciples, not with the Jews.&nbsp; But when
had celebrated the festival at evening, the chief priests came upon him with
the traitor and laid their hands on him; for <i>they</i>
were not eating the <i>Pascha</i> [that]
evening, otherwise they would not have busied themselves with him.&nbsp; And then,
having seized him, they led him off to the house of Caiaphas, where, after
spending the night, they gathered together and conducted the preliminary
inquiry.&nbsp; Then, after that, they arose and led him, in company with the crowd,
to Pilate; and at that point, the Scripture says that they did not enter the <i>praetorium</i>, so that they would not become
defiled<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a>
(so they thought) by coming in under a pagan roof, and would eat the <i>Pascha</i> at evening with their purity
intact&#8212;those most foul ones&#8212;who strained out a gnat but swallowed a camel;<a
href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a>
those who had become defiled already in soul and body by their bloodthirstiness
against the Savior feared to come in under [Pilate's] roof!&nbsp; They, on the one
hand, on that very day of the passion, ate the <i>Pascha</i>
that was injurious to their own souls, and asked for the Savior's blood&#8212;not on
their own behalf, but to their own detriment; our Savior, on the other hand,
not then, but the day before, reclined at table with his disciples and
conducted the festival that was desirable to himself.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>11.</SPAN>&nbsp;Do you
see how from that time, <i>he</i> [i.e.,
Jesus] was separating himself from them and moving away from the Jews'
bloodthirstiness, but was joining himself with his disciples, celebrating the
desirable festival together with them?&nbsp; So then, we too ought to eat the <i>Pascha</i> with Christ, while purifying our
minds from all leaven of evil and wickedness, and taking our fill of the
unleavened bread of truth and sincerity, and having within ourselves, in our
souls, the &quot;Jew in secret&quot;<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><sup>[46]</sup></a>
and the true circumcision, and anointing the doorposts of our minds with the
blood of the Lamb who was sacrificed for us, to ward off our destroyer.&nbsp; And we
do this not only at a single time of the whole year, but every week.&nbsp; Let our
&quot;Preparation&quot; be fasting,<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><sup>[47]</sup></a>
the symbol of mourning, on behalf of our former sins, and for the sake of
remembering the Savior's passion.</p>

<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>12.</SPAN>&nbsp;I assert
that the <i>Jews</i> have gone astray
from the truth, ever since they plotted against the Truth itself and drove away
from themselves the Word of Life.&nbsp; And the Scriptures of the holy Gospels
present this fact clearly.&nbsp; For they testify that the Lord ate the <i>Pascha</i> on the first day of Unleavened
Bread; but <i>they </i>did not eat the <i>Pascha </i>that was customary for them on the
day on which, as Luke says, &quot;the <i>Pascha</i>
had to be sacrificed,&quot;<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><sup>[48]</sup></a>
but instead on the following day, which was the second day of Unleavened Bread
and the fifteenth day of the lunar month, on which, when our Savior was being
judged by Pilate, they did not enter the <i>praetorium</i>&#8212;and
consequently, they did <i>not </i>eat it
on the first day of Unleavened Bread, on which it had to be sacrificed, in
accordance with the Law.&nbsp; For in that case they themselves too would have been
celebrating the <i>Pascha</i> along with
the Savior; instead, they were blinded by their own wickedness from that very
time, concurrently with their plot against the Savior, and they wandered from
all truth.&nbsp; We, on the other hand, conduct the same mysteries [as Christ did]
all through the year:&nbsp; On every day before the Sabbath we carry out a
remembrance of the Savior's passion through a fast that the Apostles first
engaged in at the time when the bridegroom had been taken away from them; and
every Lord's day we are made alive by the consecrated body of the same Savior,
and are sealed in our souls by his precious blood.</p>

odd, but something like this is required for the sense here; corruption may
