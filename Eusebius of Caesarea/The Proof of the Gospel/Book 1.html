</P>
<P>
SEE now, Theodotus,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> miracle of bishops, holy man of God, I am carrying through<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> this great work with the help of God and our Saviour the Word of God, after completing at the cost of great labour my <I>Preparation for the Gospel
</I><SPAN class="greekno">{2}</SPAN> in fifteen books.
</P>
<P>
Grant then, dear friend, my request, and labour with rue henceforward in your prayers in my effort to present the Proof of the Gospel from the prophecies extant among the Hebrews from the earliest times. I propose to adopt this method. I propose to use as witnesses those men, beloved by God, whose fame you know to be far-spread in the world:
<SPAN class="greekno">{2}</SPAN> Moses, I mean, and his successors, who shone forth with resplendent godliness, and the blessed prophets and sacred writers. I propose to shew, by quotations from them, how they forestalled events that came to the light long ages after their time, the actual
<A NAME="p2"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|2</SPAN></A>&nbsp; circumstances of the Saviour's own presentment of the Gospel, and the things which in our own day are being fulfilled by the Holy Spirit before our very eyes. It shall be my task to prove that they saw that which was not present as present, and that which as yet was not in existence as actually existing; and not only this, but that they foretold in writing the events of the future for posterity, so that by their help others can even now know what is coming, and look forward daily to the fulfilment of their oracles. What sort of fulfilment, do you ask?
<SPAN class="greekno">{3}</SPAN> They are fulfilled in countless and all kinds of ways, and amid all circumstances, both generally and in minute detail, in the lives of individual men, and in their corporate life, now nationally in the course of Hebrew history, and now in that of foreign nations. Such things as civic revolutions, changes of times, national vicissitudes, the coming of foretold prosperity, the assaults of adversity, the enslaving of races, the besieging of cities, the downfall and restoration of whole states, and countless other things that were to take place a long time after, were foretold by these writers.
</P>
<P>
But it is not now the time for me to provide full proof of this. I will postpone most of it for the present, and perhaps, from the truth of what I shall put before you, there will be some guarantee of the possibility of proving what is passed over in silence.
</P>
<P align="center">

CHAPTER    1</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
<I>The Object and Contents of the Work.</I>
</P>
<P>
IT seems now time to say what I consider to be desirable at present to draw from the prophetic writings for the proof of the Gospel.
<SPAN class="greekno">{4}</SPAN> They said that Christ, (Whom they named) the Word of God, and Himself both God and Lord, and Angel of Great Counsel, would one day dwell among men, and would become for all the nations of the world, both Greek and Barbarian, a teacher of true knowledge of God, and of such duty to God the Maker of the Universe, as the preaching of the Gospel includes. They said that He would become a little child, and would be called the Son of Man, as born of the race of Mankind. They foretold the
<A NAME="p3"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|3</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb> </SPAN>
wondrous fashion of His birth from a Virgin, and&#8212;strangest of all&#8212;they did not omit to name Bethlehem<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> the place of His birth, which is to-day so famous that men still hasten from the ends of the earth to see it, but shouted it out with the greatest clearness. As if they stole a march on history these same writers proclaimed the very time of His appearance, the precise period of His sojourn on earth.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for you, if you care to take the trouble, to see with your eyes, comprehended in the prophetic writings, all the wonderful miracles of our Saviour Jesus Christ Himself, that are witnessed to by the heavenly Gospels, and to hear His divine and perfect teaching about true holiness. How it must move our wonder, when they unmistakably proclaim the new ideal of religion preached by Him to all men, the call of His disciples, and the teaching of the new Covenant.
<SPAN class="greekno">{5} </SPAN>Yes, and in addition to all this they foretell the Jews' disbelief in Him, and disputing, the plots of the rulers, the envy of the Scribes, the treachery of one of His disciples, the schemes of enemies, the accusations of false witnesses, the condemnations of His judges, the shameful violence, unspeakable scourging, ill-omened abuse, and, crowning all, the death of shame. They portray Christ's wonderful silence, His gentleness and fortitude, and the unimaginable depths of His forbearance and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
The most ancient Hebrew oracles present all these things definitely about One Who would come in the last times, and Who would undergo such sufferings among men, and they clearly tell the source of their foreknowledge. They bear witness to the Resurrection from the dead of the Being Whom they revealed, His appearance to His disciples, His gift of the Holy Spirit to them, His return to heaven, His establishment as King on His Father's throne and His glorious second Advent yet to be at the consummation of the age. In addition to all this you can hear the wailings and lamentations of each of the prophets, wailing and lamenting characteristically over the calamities which will overtake the Jewish people because of their impiety to Him Who had been foretold.
<SPAN class="greekno">{6} </SPAN>How their kingdom, that had continued from the days of a remote ancestry to their own, would be utterly destroyed after their sin against
<A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A>
Christ; how their fathers' Laws would be abrogated, they themselves deprived of their ancient worship, robbed of the independence of their forefathers, and made slaves of their enemies, instead of free men; how their royal metropolis would be burned with fire, their venerable and holy altar undergo the flames and extreme desolation, their city be inhabited no longer by its old possessors but by races of other stock,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>while they would be dispersed among the Gentiles through the whole world, with never a hope of any cessation of evil, or breathing-space from troubles. And it is plain even to the blind, that what they saw and foretold is fulfilled in actual facts from the very day the Jews laid godless hands on Christ, and drew down on themselves the beginning of the train of sorrows.
</P>
<P>
But the prophecies of these inspired men did not begin and end in gloom, nor did their prescience extend no further than the reign of sorrow. They could change their note to joy, and proclaim a universal message of good tidings to all men in the coming of Christ: they could preach the good news that though one race were lost every nation and race of men would know God, escape from the
daemons,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> cease from ignorance and deceit and
<SPAN class="greekno">{7}</SPAN>  enjoy the light of holiness: they could picture the disciples of Christ filling the whole world with their teaching, and the preaching of their gospel introducing among all men a fresh and unknown ideal of holiness: they could see churches of Christ established by their means among all nations, and Christian people throughout the whole world bearing one common name: they could give assurance that the attacks of rulers and kings from time to time against the Church of Christ will avail nothing to cast it down, strengthened as it is by God. If so many things were proclaimed by the Hebrew divines, and if their fulfilment is so clear to us all to-day, who would not marvel at their inspiration? Who will not agree that their religious and philosophic teaching and beliefs must be sure and true, since their proof is to be found not
<A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A>
in artificial arguments, not in clever words, or deceptive syllogistic reasoning, but in simple and straightforward teaching, whose genuine and sincere character is attested by the virtue and knowledge of God evident in these inspired men? Men who were enabled not by human but by divine inspiration to see from a myriad ages back
<SPAN class="greekno">{8}</SPAN>  what was to happen long years after, may surety claim our confidence for the belief which they taught their pupils.
</P>
<P>
Now I am quite well aware, that it is usual in the case of all who have been properly taught that our Lord and Saviour Jesus is truly the Christ of God to persuade themselves in the first place that their belief is strictly in agreement with what the prophets witness about Him. And secondly, to forewarn all those, with whom they may enter on an argument, that it is by no means easy to establish their position by definite proofs. And this is why in attacking this subject myself I must of course endeavour, with God's help, to supply a complete treatment of the Proof of the Gospel from these Hebrew theologians. And the importance of my writing
does not lie in the fact that it is, as might be suggested, a polemic against the Jews. Perish the thought, far from that! For if they would fairly consider it, it is really on their side. For as it establishes Christianity on the basis of the antecedent prophecies, so it establishes Judaism from the complete fulfilment of its prophecies. To the Gentiles too it should appeal, if they would fairly consider it, because of
<SPAN class="greekno">{9}</SPAN>  the extraordinary foreknowledge shown in the prophetic writers, and of the actual events that occurred in agreement with their prophecies. It should convince them of the inspired and certain nature of the truth we hold: it should silence the tongues of false accusers by a more logical method of proof, which slanderers contend that we never offer, who in their daily arguments with us keep pounding away with all their might with the implication forsooth that we are unable to give a logical demonstration of our case, but require those who come to us to rest on faith alone.
<A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
My present work ought to have something to say to a calumny like this, as it will assuredly rebut the empty lies and blasphemy of godless heretics against the holy prophets by its exposition of the agreement of the new with the old. My argument will dispense with a longer systematic interpretation
of the prophecies, and will leave such a task to any who wish to make the study, and are able to expound such works. And I shall take as my teacher the sacred command which says &quot;sum up many things in few words,&quot; and aspire to follow it. I shall only offer such help in regard to the texts, and to the points which bear on the subject under consideration, as is absolutely necessary for their clear interpretation.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="greekno">{10}</SPAN>  But I will now cease my Introduction and begin my Proof. As we have such a mob of slanderers flooding us with the accusation that we are unable logically to present a clear demonstration of the truth we hold, and think it enough to retain those who
come to us by faith alone, and as they say that we only teach our followers like irrational animals to shut their eyes and staunchly obey what we say without examining it at all, and call them therefore &quot;the faithful&quot; because of their faith as distinct from reason, I made a natural division of the calumnies of our position in my &quot;Preparation&quot; of the subject as a whole. On the one side I placed the attacks of the polytheistic Gentiles, who accuse us of apostasy from our ancestral gods, and make a great point of the implication, that in recognizing the Hebrew oracles we honour the work of Barbarians more
<A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>
than those of the Greeks. And on the other side I set the accusation of the Jews, in which they claim to be justly incensed against us, because we do not embrace their manner of life, though we make use of their sacred writings. Such being the division, I met the first so far as I could in my <I>Preparation for the Gospel</I> by allowing that we were originally Greeks, or men of other nations who had absorbed Greek ideas, and enslaved by ancestral ties in the deceits of polytheism. But I went on to say that our conversion was due not to emotional and unexamined impulse,
<SPAN class="greekno">{11}</SPAN>  but to judgment and sober reasoning, and that our devotion to the oracles of the Hebrews thus had the support of judgment and sound reason.
</P>
<P>
And now I have to defend myself against the second class of opponents, and to embark on the investigation it requires. It has to do with those of the Circumcision, it has not yet been investigated, but I hope in time to dispose of it in the present work on the Proof of the Gospel. And so now with an invocation of the God of Jews and Greeks alike in our Saviour's Name we will take as our first object of inquiry, what is the character of the religion set before Christians. And in this same inquiry we shall record the solutions of all the points investigated.
</P>
<P align="center">
<b>
CHAPTER  2</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
<I>The Character of the Christian Religion.</I>
</P>
<P>
I HAVE already laid down in my <I>Preparation</I> that Christianity is neither a form of Hellenism, nor of Judaism, but that it is a religion with its own characteristic stamp, and that this is not anything novel or original, but something of the greatest antiquity, something natural and familiar to the godly men
<SPAN class="greekno">{12}</SPAN>  before the times of Moses who <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A>
are remembered for their holiness and justice. But now let us consider the nature of Hellenism and Judaism, and inquire under which banner we should find these pre-Mosaic saints, whose godliness and holiness is attested by Moses himself. Judaism would be correctly defined as the polity constituted according to the Law of Moses, dependent on the one, omnipotent God. Hellenism you might summarily describe as the worship of many Gods according to the ancestral religions of all nations. What then would you say about the pre-Mosaic and pre-Judaic saints, whose lives are recorded by Moses, Enoch for instance, of whom he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And Enoch pleased God.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Or Noah, of whom he says again:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And Noah was a man righteous in his generation ''&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Or Seth, and Japheth, of whom he writes:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Blessed be the Lord God of Seth (Shem), . . . and may God make room for Japheth.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Add to these Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, include as is right the patriarch Job, and all the rest who lived according to the ideals of these men; they must, you may think, have been either Jews or Greeks. But yet they could not properly be called Jews, inasmuch as the system of Moses' Law had not yet been brought into being.
<SPAN class="greekno">{13}</SPAN>  For if (as we have admitted) Judaism is only the observance of Moses' Law, and Moses did not appear until long after the date of the men named, it is obvious that those whose holiness he records who lived before him, were not Jews. Neither can we regard them as Greeks, inasmuch as they were not under the dominion of polytheistic superstition. For it is recorded of Abraham that he left his father's house and his
<A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A>
kindred altogether, and cleaved to the One God alone, Whom he confesses when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;I will stretch out<I> </I>(my hand) to the most-high God, who created the heaven and the earth.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And Jacob is recorded by Moses as saying to his house and all his people:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;2. Remove the strange gods from your midst, 3. and let us arise and go to Bethel, and make there an altar to the Lord that heard me in the day of affliction, who was with me, and preserved me in the way wherein I went. 4. And they gave to Jacob the strange gods, which were in their hands, and the ear-rings in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the terebinth that is in Shechem, and destroyed  them to this day.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
These men, then, were not involved in the errors of idolatry, moreover they were outside the pale of Judaism; yet, though they were neither Jew nor Greek by birth, we know them to have been conspicuously pious, holy, and just.
<SPAN class="greekno">{14}</SPAN>  This compels us to conceive some other ideal of religion, by which they must have guided their lives. Would not this be exactly that third form of religion midway between Judaism and Hellenism, which I have already deduced, as the most ancient and most venerable of all religions, and which has been preached of late to all nations through our Saviour. Christianity would therefore be not a form of Hellenism nor of Judaism, but something between the two, the most ancient organization for holiness, and the most venerable philosophy, only lately codified as the law
for all mankind in the whole world. The convert from Hellenism to Christianity does not land in Judaism, nor does one who rejects the Jewish worship become <I>ipso facto </I>a Greek. From whichever side they come, whether it be Hellenism or Judaism, they find their place in that intermediate law of life preached by the godly and holy men of old lime, which our Lord and Saviour has raised up anew after its long sleep, in accordance with Moses' own prophecies, and those of the other prophets on the point. Yes, Moses himself writes prophetically in the oracles
<A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A>
addressed to Abraham, that in days to come <SPAN class="greekno">{15}</SPAN>  not only Abraham's descendants, his Jewish seed, but all the tribes and nations of the earth will be counted worthy of God's blessing on the common basis of a piety like Abraham's.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;1. And the Lord said to Abram, Go forth out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and from the house of thy father, and come hither into the land which I shall shew thee. 2. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed, 3. and I will bless those that bless thee, and I will curse those that curse thee, and in thee all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And again God said:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Shall I hide from Abraham my servant that I shall do? For Abraham shall become a great and numerous nation, and in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
How could all the nations and families of the earth be blessed in Abraham, if there was no connection between him and them, either of spiritual character  or physical kinship? There was assuredly no physical kinship between Abraham and the Scythians, or the Egyptians, or the Aethiopians, or the Indians, or the Britons, or the Spaniards: such nations and others more distant than they could not surely hope to receive any blessing because of any physical kinship to Abraham. It was quite as unlikely that all the nations would have any common claim to share the spiritual blessings of Abraham.
<SPAN class="greekno">{16}</SPAN>  For some of them
practised marriage with mothers and incest with daughters, some of them unmentionable vice. The religion of others lay in slaughter, and the deification of animals, idols of lifeless wood, and superstitions of deceiving spirits. Others burned their old men alive, and commended as holy and good the customs of delivering their dearest to the flames, or feasting on dead bodies. Men brought up in such savage ways
<A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A>
could not surely share in the blessing of the godly, unless they escaped from their savagery, and embraced a way of life similar to the piety of Abraham. For even he, a foreigner and a stranger to the religion which he afterwards embraced, is said to have changed his life, to have cast away his ancestral superstition, to have left his home and kindred and fathers' customs, and the manner of life in which he was born and reared, and to have followed God, Who gave him the oracles which are preserved in the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
If Moses then, who came after Abraham and established a polity for the Jewish race on the basis of the law which he gave them, had laid down the kind of laws which were the guide of godly men before his own time, and such as it was possible for all nations to adopt, so that it should be possible for all the tribes and nations of the world to worship according to Moses' enactments;
<SPAN class="greekno">{17}</SPAN>  which is the same as saying that the oracles foretold that through Moses' lawgiving men of all nations would worship God and follow Judaism, being brought to it by the law, and would be blessed with the blessing of Abraham&#8212;then it would have been right for us to be keeping the enactments of Moses. But if the' polity of Moses was not applicable to the other nations, but only to the Jews and not to all of them, but only to the inhabitants of Judaea, then it was altogether necessary to set up another kind of religion different from the law of Moses, that all the nations of the world might take it as their guide with Abraham, and receive an equal share of blessing with him.
</P>
<P align="center">
<b>
CHAPTER 3&nbsp;</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
 <I>That the System of Moses was not Suitable for All Nations.</I>
</P>
<P>
THAT the enactments of Moses, as I said, were only applicable to the Jews, but not to all of them, and certainly not to the dispersed (among the Gentiles), only in fact to the inhabitants of Palestine, will be plain to you if you reflect thus. For the law of Moses says:
<A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<SPAN class="greekno">{18}</SPAN>  &quot;Thrice in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And it defines more exactly at what place they should all meet, when it says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Three times in the year shall thy males appear before the Lord, thy God, in the place which the Lord shall choose.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
You see that it does not bid them meet in each city, or in any indefinite place, but &quot;in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.&quot; There thrice a year it enacts that they must assemble together, and it determines the times, when they must meet at the place where the rites of the worship there are to be celebrated. One season is that of the Passover, the second,' fifty days later, is called the Feast of Pentecost, and the third is in the seventh month after the Passover, on the Day of Atonement, when all the Jews still perform their fast. And a curse is laid on all who do not obey what is enacted. It is plain that all who were to meet at Jerusalem thrice in the year and perform their rites would not be able to live far from Judaea: but they live all round its boundaries. If then it would be impossible even for the lews whose home is the farthest from Palestine to obey their law,
<SPAN class="greekno">{19}</SPAN>  it would be absurd to hold that it could be applicable to all nations and to men in the uttermost parts of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Hear now in what way women after childbirth are bidden by the same Lawgiver to go and present their offerings to God, as follows:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And the Lord spake to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whatsoever woman shall have conceived and borne a male-child shall be unclean seven days.''&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And he adds after saying something else:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;6. And when the days of her purification shall have been fulfilled for a son or a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of a year old without blemish for a whole burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering to the door of the tabernacle of witness to the priest, 7. she shall present [them] before the Lord. And the priest shall make atonement for her, and shall purify her from the issue of her blood; this is the law of her who bears a male or a female.&quot;
<A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Again, in addition to this the same law bids those who have contracted defilement by mourning or touching a corpse only to be purified by the ashes of an heifer, and to abstain from their accustomed work for seven days. This is what it says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;10. And it shall be a perpetual statute to the children of Israel and to the proselytes in the midst of them. 11.
He that touches the dead body of any soul of man shall be unclean seven days, 12. shall be purified on the third day and shall be made clean on the seventh day.
<SPAN class="greekno">{20}</SPAN>  And if he be not purified on the third day, and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean. 13. Every one who touches the dead body of a soul of a man, if he shall have died, and he be not purified, he has defiled the tabernacle of the witness of the Lord. That soul shall be cut off from Israel, because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him. He is unclean, uncleanness is on him. 14. And this is the law: if a man die in a house, everyone that goeth into that house, and all the things that are in the house, are unclean seven days. 15. And every open vessel<I> </I>which is not bound with a fastening, shall be unclean; 16. and every one who shall touch on the face any man slain by the sword, or a corpse, or a human bone, or a sepulchre, shall be unclean seven clays. 17. And they shall take for the unclean of the burnt ashes of purification, and shall pour it into a vessel, 18. and shall take hyssop. And a clean man shall clip it, and sprinkle it on the house and the furniture and the souls that are therein, and on him that has touched the human bone, or the slain man, or the dead, or the sepulchre. 19. And the clean man shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day, and  on the seventh day,
<SPAN class="greekno">{21}</SPAN>&nbsp;and he shall wash his garments, and shall wash [his body] with water, and shall be unclean until the evening. 20. And a man, if he be defiled, and not purified, that soul shall be cast out of the congregation, because the water of purification has not been sprinkled on him; and this shall be a perpetual law to you.&quot;
<A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
When Moses made this law he even determined the ritual of the sprinkling with water. He said that a red heifer without spot must be completely burnt, and that a portion of its ashes must be cast into the water, with which those who had been defiled by a corpse were to be purified. Where the heifer is to be burnt, where the woman is to bring her offerings after childbirth, where she is to celebrate the other rites, is not in doubt. It is not to be done indifferently in every place, but only in that place which he defines. This is plain from his enactment, when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And there shall be a place, which the Lord your God shall choose, in which his name shall   be called upon, there shall ye bear whatsoever I bid you to-day.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And he explains in accurate order, adding:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;13. Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy whole burnt-offerings in any place, which thou mayst see, 14. but in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, in one of thy cities; there shall thou offer thy whole burnt-offerings, and there shall thou do whatsoever I bid you to-day.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And he makes this addition:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;<SPAN class="greekno">{22}</SPAN>&nbsp;17. Thou shall not be able to eat in all thy cities the tenth of thy corn and wine and oil, the firstborn of thy herd and thy flock, and all thy vows whatsoever thou hast vowed, and thy thank-offerings, and the firstfruits of thine hands. 18. But before the Lord shall thou eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, thou and thy sons and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the stranger<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>&nbsp;
<SPAN class="greekno">{1}</SPAN>&nbsp;that is in thy cities.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And proceeding he confirms the statement, where he says:&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
 &quot;But thou shall take thy holy things, if thou hast any, and thy vows, and shall come to the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself.''&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And again:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Thou shall tithe a tenth of all the produce of thy seed, the produce of thy field year by year. And thou
<A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A>
shall eat it in the place <SPAN class="greekno">{2a}</SPAN>&nbsp;which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called on there.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And then in considering what ought to be done if the place designated by him were far off, and the yield of fruit large,  how  the year's   fruits  for  the whole  burnt-offering could be carried to the place of God, he lays down the following law:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;23. And if the journey be too far for thee, and thou art not able to bring them, because the place is far from thee, which the Lord your God shall choose to have his name called on there, because the Lord thy God shall bless thee; 24. and thou shall sell them for money,
<SPAN class="greekno">{2b}</SPAN>&nbsp;and shall take the money in thy hands, and shall go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose. 25. And thou shall give the money for whalsoever thy soul desireth for oxen or sheep, or wine, or slrong drink, or for whalsoever thy soul desireth and thou shall consume it there before the Lord.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he again sets his seal on the actual place, when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;19. Every firstborn that shall be born of thy kine and sheep, thou shall offer the males to the Lord thy God; thou shall not work with thy firstborn calf, and thou shall not shear thy firstborn sheep: 20. thou shall eat it before the Lord year by year,
<SPAN class="greekno">{2c}</SPAN>&nbsp;in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy house.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Next notice how he arranges the celebration of the feasts, not anywhere in the land, but only in the appointed place. For he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Observe the month  of new corn, and thou  shall keep the  Passover lo the Lord thy God, sheep and bulls,   in   the   place which   the   Lord  thy  God   shall choose.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he again reminds them, saying:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;5. Thou shall not be able to sacrifice the passover <SPAN class="greekno">{2d}</SPAN>&nbsp;in any of the cities which the Lord thy God gives thee; 6. But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, to have his name called on there, thou shall sacrifice the passover at even at the setting of the sun
<A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A>
at the time when them earnest out of Egypt. 7. And thou shalt boil and eat<I> </I>it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Such, then, is the law of the Feast of the Passover. Hear that of Pentecost:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;9. Seven weeks in full shalt thou number to thyself, from when thou beginnest to put the sickle in the corn,<SUP> </SUP>10. and thou shalt keep a feast of weeks to the Lord thy God, according as thy hand has power in whatsoever things the Lord thy God gives thee to bless thee. 11. And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy servant, and thy maid,
<SPAN class="greekno">{3a}</SPAN>&nbsp;and the Levite that is in thy cities, and the proselyte; and the orphan, and the widow that is among you, in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, to have his name called on there.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And hear where he commands the third feast to be celebrated:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;13. And thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles when thou gatherest in from thy corn-floor and from thy wine-press, 14. and shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the widow,
<SPAN class="greekno">{3b}</SPAN>&nbsp;in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
As he is so insistent on the selected place, and says so many times that they are to meet there in all their tribes and in all their families, the law could hardly apply to those living even a little way from Judaea, and still less to the nations of the whole world, especially as he allows no pardon to those who transgress his ordinances, and invokes a curse on those who do not carry them all out to the minutest detail, in the following words:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;<SPAN class="greekno">{3c}</SPAN>&nbsp;Cursed is he who continueth not in all things written in this law to do them.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Consider, again, other instances of the impossibility of all men following the law of Moses. He makes a distinction between voluntary transgressions and those hard to evade, and after assigning penalties to sins which deserve
<A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A>
the severest punishment, he provides laws by which those who sin unwittingly are to receive different treatment. One of these runs as follows:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;27. And if a soul of the people of the land shall sin unwittingly by doing anything contrary to the commandments of the Lord that ought not to be done, and shall transgress, 28. and his sin shall be known to him, wherein he hath sinned [in it], then shall he bring [his gift] a kid of the goats, a female without blemish,
<SPAN class="greekno">{3d}</SPAN>&nbsp;he shall bring it for his sin that he hath sinned<I> </I>29. in the place where they slay the whole burnt-offerings, 30. and the priest shall take of the blood.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
You see here how one who has sinned unintentionally is required to present himself at the place where the whole burnt-offerings are sacrificed. And this is the place the law has already so often mentioned, when it says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;The place which the Lord thy God shall choose.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
But, indeed, the Lawgiver himself perceived the impossibility for all  mankind  to carry out the law, and clearly noted it by not promulgating his law universally for all, but with this limitation:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;If a soul sin unwittingly of the people of the land.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he lays down a second law which says: <SPAN class="greekno">{4a}</SPAN>&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And if a soul  hear the voice of the swearing of an oath, and he is a witness or has seen or been conscious of it, if he do not report it, he shall bear the iniquity.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
What is he to do?    He is to take the victim in his hands and go with all speed to the purification.    And of course that   must take place where  the whole burnt-offerings are sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
And once more a third law:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;2. The soul, it says, which shall touch any unclean thing, or carcases of unclean cattle, and should take from it, he also himself is defiled and transgresses, 3. or if he touch the uncleanness of a man, and by all the uncleanness that he touches be defiled, and
<SPAN class="greekno">{4b}</SPAN>&nbsp;know it not, and afterwards should know it and transgress.&quot;
<A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Here the only thing necessary for the polluted person is for him to go once more to the sacred place, and offer for the sin which he has sinned a female animal from his flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for his sin. And the law was the same in the case of a soul, which shall &quot;swear pronouncing with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; and when he knoweth of it and is guilty in one of those things, and shall confess the sin that he hath sinned:&quot;he too, the law says, taking the same offering, is to go with all speed to the sacred place, and the priest is to pray on his behalf for the sin, and his sin shall be forgiven. And another law besides those I have quoted makes this provision:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;The soul which shall be really unconscious, and shall sin unwittingly in any of the holy things of the Lord, even he shall bear a ram for his transgression to the Lord. [And he shall bear it again to the high-priest to the place, that is to say the chosen place.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And he adds a sixth law in these words:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <P>
&quot;<SPAN class="greekno">{4d}</SPAN>&nbsp;And the soul which shall sin and do one thing against the commandments of the Lord, which it is not right to do, and hath not known it, and shall have transgressed and contracted guilt, he shall even bring a ram to the High Priest, and the priest shall make atonement for his trespass of ignorance, and he knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
The following is a seventh, law:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;2. The soul which shall have sinned and surely overlooked the commandments of the Lord, and shall deal falsely in the affairs of his neighbour in the matter of a deposit, or concerning association (in business), or plunder, or has in any way wronged his neighbour, 3. or has found that which was lost, and has lied concerning it, and shall have sworn unjustly concerning any one of all the things, whatsoever a man may do, so as to sin thereby; 4. it shall come to pass, whenever he so hath sinned and transgressed, that he shall restore the plunder he has seized, or redress the injustice he has
<A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A>
committed, or restore the deposit which was entrusted to him, <SPAN class="greekno">{5a}</SPAN>&nbsp;5. or the lost article he has found of any kind, about which he swore unjustly, he shall even restore it in full, and shall add to it the fifth part.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Here, again, after  confession and reparation the transgressor had to go with all speed, putting everything else on one side, to the place, which the Lord our  God   should choose, and offer for his sin an unblemished ram, and the priest was to pray for him before the Lord, and he would be forgiven.<SPAN class="greekno">{5b}</SPAN>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
In this careful way our wonderful Moses distinguished sins done unwittingly and ignorantly from intentional offences, on which in the government of his people he set rigorous penalties. For he that would not pardon the unwitting offender before he had confessed his offence, exacted a small penalty from him in the sacrifice ordained, by requiring him to repair with all speed
<SPAN class="greekno">{5c}</SPAN>&nbsp;to the sacred place fostered both the religious spirit and watchfulness of those who worshipped God by his rule, and of course restrained even more the desires of willing offenders. What, then, must be our conclusion from all this, when, as we have said, we find Moses summing up his whole system with a curse, where he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Cursed is everyone, who shall not remain in all the things written in this law. to do them &quot;?&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Was it, then, meant that Moses' future disciples from the ends of the earth must do all these things, if they were to escape the curse and receive the blessing promised to Abraham? Were they to go thrice a year to Jerusalem,
<SPAN class="greekno">{5d}</SPAN>&nbsp;and were the female worshippers of all nations, fresh from the pangs of childbirth, to undertake so long a journey, to offer the sacrifice ordained by Moses for each one of their children? Were those who had touched a dead body, or had forsworn themselves, or had sinned against their will, to come from the ends of the earth, to run and hasten to the purification that was required by the law, in order to escape the visitation of the curse? Of course it is clear to you that it was hard enough to follow Moses' rule of life for those who lived round Jerusalem, or only inhabited Judaea, and that it was quite out of the question for the
<A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
other nations to fulfil it.
</P>
<P>
Hence, of course, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus the Son of God, said to His disciples after His Resurrection:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;<SPAN class="greekno">{6a}</SPAN>&nbsp;Go  and  make  disciples of all the  nations,'' and added:
&quot;Teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you.''
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
For He did not bid them to teach the laws of Moses to all nations, but whatsoever He Himself had commanded: that is to say, the contents of the Gospels. And agreeably to this His disciples and apostles in considering the requirements of the Gentiles decided that Moses' enactments were unsuitable to their needs, since neither they themselves nor their fathers had found them easy to be kept. As St. Peter says in the Acts:
<SPAN class="greekno">{6b}</SPAN>&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Now therefore why do ye attempt to lay a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And agreeably to this Moses himself for this very reason said that another prophet would be raised up &quot;like unto him&quot;; and publishes the good news that he should be a lawgiver for all the nations. He speaks of Christ in a riddle. He orders his followers to obey him in these prophetic words.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;<SPAN class="greekno">{6c}</SPAN>&nbsp;15. A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you from your brethren, like unto me, ye shall hear him [whatsoever he saith unto you]. 19. And it shall
<A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A>
be that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be cast out of its race.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And that this prophet, who is clearly the Christ, should come forth from the Jews and rule all nations, he proclaims again when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;<SPAN class="greekno">{6d}</SPAN>&nbsp;5. How fair are thy dwellings,  O Jacob, and  thy
tents, O Israel, 6. as shady groves, and as a garden by a river, and as  tents which   God pitched.    7. There
shall come a man out of his seed, and   he shall rule
over many nations, and his kingdom shall be exalted.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
He makes it clear from which  tribe of all the twelve that  comprised  the   Hebrew   race,   namely   the   tribe  of
Judah, Christ the Lawgiver of the Gentiles according to the prophecy should arise.    He is clear as to the date, for
it would be after the cessation of the  Jewish monarchy which  had been handed down  from their forefathers.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;A ruler shall not fail from  Juda, nor a prince  from
his loins, until  there come the things  stored  up   for
him;  and he is the expectation of the nations.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
What &quot;expectation&quot; could this be, but that expressed in the promise to Abraham  that in him all the families of
the earth should be blessed?    Moses has, therefore, made <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
it quite plain from his own words that he was quite well aware of the failure of the law he had laid down to apply to all nations, and that another prophet would be necessary for the fulfilment of the oracles given to Abraham. And this was He, of Whom his prophecy proclaimed the good news that one should arise from the tribe of Judah and rule all nations.
</P>
<P align="center">
CHAPTER  4
</P>
<P align="center">
<I>Why it  is   we  reject  the Jews'   Way of Life,  though we accept their Writings.</I>
</P>
<P>
THESE, then, are the reasons why we have accepted and loved as belonging to ourselves the sacred books of the Hebrews, including as they do prophecies relating to us Gentiles. And the more so, since it was not Moses only who foretold the coming of the Lawgiver of the Gentiles after him, but really the whole succession of the prophets, who proclaimed the same truth with one voice, as David, when he said:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Appoint, O Lord, a Lawgiver over them: let the nations know that they are but men.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
See how he too speaks of a second Lawgiver of the nations. And in the same spirit in another (psalm) he calls on the Gentiles to sing, not the ancient song of Moses, but a new song, when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;1. Sing to the Lord a new song; | sing to the Lord all the whole earth: | 3. proclaim among the nations his glory, | among all peoples his wonders: | 4. For great is the Lord, and very worthy to be praised, | he is terrible above all gods. | 5. For all the gods of the nations are demons, | but it is the Lord that made the heavens. | 7. Bring to the Lord ye families of the nations; | 8. bring to the Lord glory to his name.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again: .
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;10.  Say among the  nations, The Lord is  King. | <A NAME="p23"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|23</SPAN></A>
For he has established the world, that it shall not be shaken.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;1. Sing to the Lord a new song, | for he hath done marvellous things, | 2. The Lord hath made known his salvation; | Before the nations he hath revealed righteousness. | 3. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And notice how he ordains the new song not for the Jewish race only; the ancient song of Moses suited them, but for all the nations. This new song is called by Jeremiah, another Hebrew prophet, &quot;a new covenant&quot;where he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;31. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with   the house of  Israel, and with the  house  of  Juda:   32. not according  to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land  of Egypt: for they abode not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord.    33. For this is my, covenant which I will make with the house of Israel, saith the Lord,  I will  put my laws in their minds, and on their hearts I will write (them), and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
You  see  here  that he distinguishes   two  covenants,  the old and the new, and says that the new would  not be like the old which was given to the fathers.    For the old covenant was given as a law to the Jews, when they had fallen  from  the religion  of their forefathers, and had embraced the manners and life of the Egyptians, and had declined to the errors of polytheism, and  the idolatrous superstitions of the Gentiles.    It was intended to raise up the fallen, and to set on their feet those who were lying on their faces, by suitable teaching.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;For the  law, it is  said, is not for the righteous, but for the unjust and disorderly, for the unrighteous and for sinners, and for those like them.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
But the new covenant leads those who, through our Saviour <A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A>
by the grace and gift of God are raised up, to a rapid march into the kingdom promised by God. It summons all men equally to share together the same good things. This &quot;new covenant&quot; Isaiah, another of the Hebrew prophets, calls the &quot;new law,&quot;when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;3.  For out of Sion shall go forth a law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.    And all the nations
shall go, and all the peoples shall be gathered together,
and shall say, Let us go up to the Mount of the Lord,
and to the house of the God of Jacob.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
This  law going forth from Sion,  different  from  the   law
enacted in the desert by Moses on Mount Sinai, what can
it be but the word of the Gospel, &quot;going forth from Sion&quot;
through our Saviour Jesus Christ, and going through all
the nations?    For it is plain that it was in Jerusalem and
Mount Sion adjacent thereto, where our Lord and Saviour
for the most part  lived and taught, that the law of  the
new covenant began and from thence went forth and shone
upon all, according to the commands which He gave his disciples when He said:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Go ye, and make disciples of all the nations, teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
What could He mean but the teaching and discipline of the new covenant? Since, then, I have proved my
facts, let us proceed to investigate together the character of the new covenant, and the new song and the new law that were foretold.
</P>
<P align="center">
<b>
CHAPTER   5&nbsp;</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
 <I>The Character of the New Covenant of Christ.</I>
</P>
<P>
I HAVE now proved that the old covenant and the law given by Moses was only applicable to the Jewish race, and only to such of them as lived in their own land. It did not apply to other nations of the world nor to Jews
<A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A>
inhabiting foreign soil. And I have shown that the ideal of the new covenant must be helpful to the life of all nations: the members of its kingdom are to be restricted in no way whatever. Considerations of country, race or locality, or anything else are not to affect them in any way at all. The law and life of our Saviour Jesus Christ shows itself to be such, being a renewal of the ancient pre-Mosaic religion, in which Abraham, the friend of God, and his forefathers are shown to have lived. And if you cared to compare the life of Christians and the worship introduced among all nations by Christ with the lives of the men who with Abraham are witnessed to by Scripture as holy and righteous, you would find cne and the same ideal. For they too turned their backs on the errors of polytheism, they relinquished idolatrous superstition, they looked beyond the whole of the visible creation and deified neither sun nor moon, nor any part of the whole. They raised themselves to the Supreme God, Himself the Highest, the Creator of heaven and earth. And Moses himself bears this out in his history of ancient times when he records Abraham's saying:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;I  will stretch  forth my hand unto God most high, who hath created the heaven and the earth.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And when, before this, he introduces Melchizedek, whom he calls the priest of the Most High God, blessing Abraham as follows:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Blessed be Abraham by God most high, who hath created the heaven and the earth.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And you would find that Enoch and Noah were reckoned just and well pleasing to God in the same way as Abraham. Job, ton, a just, true, blameless, devout man, averse from everything evil, is recorded as pre-Mosaic. He underwent a
<A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A>
trial of his utter devotion to the God of the Universe when he lost everything he had, and left the greatest example of holiness to posterity, when he spoke these philosophic words:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;21. I myself came forth naked from my mother's womb, and naked shall I depart.    The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away.    As the Lord pleased, so it came to pass.    Blessed be the name of the Lord.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
That he said this as a worshipper of the God of the universe is made quite clear when he goes on to say:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;4. For he is wise in mind and mighty and great;
6. Who   shakes   the   (earth)   under  heaven   from   its
foundation and its pillars  totter.    7. Who  commands
the sun and it rises not, and he seals up the stars;
8. Who alone has stretched out the heaven.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
If then the teaching of Christ has bidden all nations now
to worship no other  God  but  Him  whom   the  men of
old   and   the   pre-Mosaic    saints    believed   in,    we    are
clearly partakers of the religion of these men of old time.
And if we partake of their religion we shall surely share
their blessing.    Yes, and  equally with  us they knew and
bore witness to the Word of God, Whom we love to call
Christ.   They were thought worthy in very remarkable ways of beholding His actual presence and theophany.
</P>
<P>
Remember how Moses calls the Being, Who appeared to the patriarchs, and often delivered to them the oracles afterwards written down in Scripture, sometimes God and Lord, and sometimes the Angel of the Lord. He clearly implies that this was not the Omnipotent God, but a secondary Being, rightly called the God and Lord of holy men, but the Angel of the Most High His Father. Thus he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;10. And Jacob went forth  ... to Charran, 11. and came to a certain place, and he slept there. . . . And he
<A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
took of the stones of the place, and put it at his head, and lay down to sleep in that place, 12. and he dreamed: and behold, a ladder fixed on the earth whose top reached to heaven, and the angels of God ascended and descended on it. 13. And the Lord stood upon it, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: fear not, the earth, the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed: 14 and thy seed shall be as the sand of the earth.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
To which he adds:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;16. And Jacob arose in the morning, and took the stone, which he had put under his head, and set it up as a pillar.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Then  further  on  he  calls   this  God   and   Lord   Who appeared to him the Angel of God.    For Jacob says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;11. For the Angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob.   And I said, What is it? &quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And then:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;12. I have seen, he says, all that Laban does to thee. I am the God that was seen by thee in the place of God, where thou anointedst for me there a pillar, and thou
vowedst to me there a vow.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
This same being who appeared to Abraham is called Lord and God. He teaches the saint mysteriously of His Father's rule, and speaks some things, as it were, of another God, which I will examine in their place. Then, again, it is impious to suppose that the Being who answered Job after his severe trial was the same. For when He shows Himself first in the whirlwind and the clouds He reveals Himself as the God of the Universe, but He goes on to reveal Himself in a way which makes Job say:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;4. Hear me, O Lord, and I will speak.    5. I heard of thee before by the hearing of the ears, but now mine eye hath seen thee.&quot;&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 And if it is not possible for the Most High God, the <A NAME="p28"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|28</SPAN></A>
Invisible, the Uncreated, and the Omnipotent to be said to be seen in mortal form, the Being Who was seen must have been the Word of God, Whom we call Lord as we do the Father. But it is needless for me to labour the point, since it is possible to find instances in Holy Scripture. These I will collect at leisure in connection with my present work<SUP> </SUP>to prove that He Who was seen by the patriarchal saints was none other than the Word of God.
</P>
<P>
Therefore besides the conception of the Creator of the Universe, we and they have inherited also the conception of Christ in common. Hence you can find instances of the pre-Mosaic saints being called &quot;Christs,&quot; just as we are called Christians. Hear what the oracle in the Psalms says about them:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;12. When they were few in numbers, very few, and strangers in the land, 13. and they went from nation to nation, from (one) kingdom to another people: 14. He suffered no man to wrong them, and he reproved kings for their sakes, saying: 15. 'Touch not my Christs, and do no evil to my prophets.'&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
The whole context shows that this must be referred to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: they therefore shared the name of Christ with us.
</P>
<P align="center">
<b>
CHAPTER 6</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
<I>The Nature of the Life according to the New Covenant proclaimed to All Men by Christ.</I>
</P>
<P>
JUST as a life of virtue and a system of holiness is through the teaching of Christ preached to all nations without any reference to the Mosaic legislation, so by these men of old time the same independent ideal of holiness was upheld. They cared nothing for circumcision, nor do we. They did not abstain from eating certain beasts, neither do we. For instance, Moses introduces Melchizedek, priest of the Most High God, uncircumdsed, not anointed with prepared
<A NAME="p29"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|29</SPAN></A> ointment according to Moses, knowing naught of the Sabbath, paying no heed whatever to the commandments afterwards given by Moses to the whole Jewish race, hut living exactly according to the Gospel of Christ. And yet Moses says he was the priest of the Most High God, and the superior of Abraham. For he is introduced as blessing Abraham. Such too was Noah, a just man in his generation, whom as a kindling seed of the human race Almighty God preserved in the destruction by the flood when all men on earth were destroyed. He again was quite ignorant of Jewish customs, he was uncircumcised, he did not follow the Mosaic law in any point, yet he is recognized as conspicuously just. And Enoch before him, who is said to have pleased God, and to have been translated, so that his death was not seen, was another like person, uncircumcised, with no part or lot in the law of Moses, living a distinctly Christian rather than a Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
And Abraham himself, coming later than those already named, being younger than they according to the age men reached in those times, though an old man in reality, was the first to receive circumcision as a seal, for the sake of his descendants, and he left it to those who should be born of him according to the flesh as a sign of their descent from him. He too before he had a son, and before he was circumcised, by his rejection of idolatry, and his confession of the one omnipotent God, yea, by his virtuous life alone is shown to be one who lived as a Christian, not as a Jew. For he is represented as having kept the commandments and the precepts and the ordinances of God before the enactments of Moses. That is why God giving the oracle to Isaac says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And  I will give to thy seed all this land, and in
thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
Because Abraham thy father heard my voice, and kept
my commandments, and my laws, and my judgments, and my statutes.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
So there were before the Mosaic law other commandments of God, and ordinances not like those of Moses, other laws and precepts of Christ, by which they were justified. Moses
<A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A>
clearly shews that these were not the same as his own enactments, when he says to the people:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Hear, Israel, the ordinances and the judgments, all that I speak in your ears this day, and ye shall learn them, and observe to do them. The Lord your God made a covenant with you in Choreb; the Lord did not make this covenant with your fathers, but with you.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
See how distinctly he alludes to this covenant, when he says God did not give the same covenant to their fathers. For if he had said that absolutely no covenant was given to their fathers it would have been a false statement. For Holy Scripture testifies that a covenant of some kind was given both to Abraham and Noah. And so Moses adds that one &quot;not the same&quot; was given to their fathers, implying that other greater and glorious covenant, by which they were shown forth as friends of God. So Moses
records that Abraham by his faith in Almighty God attained righteousness when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
This text shews clearly that he received the sign of circumcision after his attainment of righteousness and after the witness to his holiness, and that this added nothing at all to his justification.
</P>
<P>
Again, you would find Joseph in pre-Mosaic times in the palaces of the Egyptians living in freedom not burdened by Judaism. Moses himself, the leader and lawgiver of the Jews, lived from his babyhood with the daughter of the King of Egypt, and partook of the Egyptian food without question. What is to be said of Job the thrice-blessed, the true, the blameless, the just, the holy, what was the cause of his holiness and justice, was it Moses' commandments? Certainly not. Was it the keeping of the Sabbath, or any other Jewish observance? How could that be, if Job was earlier than the time of Moses and his legislation? For Moses was seventh from Abraham, and Job fifth, preceding him by two generations. And if you regard his life, you will see it was untouched by the Mosaic legislation, but not foreign to the teaching of our Saviour. Thus in reviewing his life in his apology to his friends he says:
<A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;12. For I saved the poor from the hand of the powerful, and I helped the orphan who had no helper.<SUP> </SUP>The mouth of the widow blessed me, 14. and I was clad in righteousness. I put on judgment as a cloak, 15. an eye was I to the blind, a foot to the lame, 16. I was a father of the weak.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
This surely is exactly the same teaching which is preached to us all in the Gospel. Then again as one well acquainted with the words, &quot;Weep with those that weep,&quot;<I> </I>and &quot;Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh&quot;; and &quot;If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it,&quot;which are included in the Gospel teaching, he shews his sympathy for the miserable by saying:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;25. And I wept for every weak one&#8212;I groaned when I saw a man in difficulties.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Then, again, this holy man forestalls the Gospel teaching, which forbids unseemly laughter, when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;5. But if I had gone with scorners, and if my foot has hasted to deceit 6. For I am weighed in a just balance, and the Lord knows my innocence.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And where the Mosaic law says &quot;Thou shall not commit adultery,&quot;and assigns death as the punishment of adulterers, He who draws out the law of the Gospel teaching, says: &quot;It was said to them of old time, Thou shall not commit adultery; but I say unto you, thou shall not desire at all.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Look well at the man of whom we are speaking; he was so good a Christian in his life that he restrained even his looks when they were wayward, and made it his boast so to do&#8212; for he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;9. And if my heart has followed my eye for the wife of another man.&quot;<SUP> &nbsp; </SUP>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he gives the reason, as he continues:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;11. For the spirit of a man is not to be stayed, in the case of defiling another man's wife. 12. For it is a fire burning on every side, and where it enters, it utterly destroys.&quot;
<A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Here he shows his incorruptibility:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;7. If, too, I have touched gifts with my hands; 8. then let me sow, and others eat, and let me be uprooted from the earth.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
How he treated his servants we may learn from his teaching here:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;13. And if I  have  trifled  with the  cause of  my servant, or handmaiden, when they pleaded with me.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again he gives the reason:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;14. What, then, should I do, if the Lord should try me? ...    15. Were not they also formed as I was in the womb?    Yea, we were formed in the same womb.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
He adds:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;16. I did not cause the eye of the widow to fail. 17. And if I did eat my morsel alone, and did not share it with the orphan, ...   19. and if I saw the naked perishing, and did not clothe him.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again he proceeds:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;24. And if I trusted in a precious stone, 25. and if I rejoiced when my wealth was great, and if I laid my hand on unnumbered (treasures).&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again he gives the reason:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;26.  Do we not see the sun waxing and waning, and the moon eclipsed? &quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
So, again, whereas the teaching of the Gospel says:
</P>
<P>
&quot;43. It was said to them of old time, Thou shall love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies&quot;: Job wonderfully anticipating the command by his own original teaching actually carried it out, for he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;29. And if I, too, was glad at the fall of my enemies, and said in my heart, It is well&#8212;30. then let my ear hear my curse.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he adds:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;But the stranger did not remain outside, and my door was opened to all that came,&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
showing himself no stranger in spirit to Him, who said, &quot;I was a stranger, and ye took me in.&quot;Then hear what he says about offences done unintentionally:
<A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;33. Or if too, having sinned unintentionally, I hid my sin.    34. For I did not stand in awe of a great multitude, so as not to speak boldly before them.    And if I did not let the poor depart (from my door) with an empty bosom . . .    35. And if I  had not feared the hand of the Lord.    And as to the written charge which I  had  against any .  . .    37. I  did   not  rend  it  and return it, taking nothing from the debtor.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
So  and   in   such   ways  the   pre-Mosaic  saints  (for  from the record of one we may imagine the life of all), waged their renowned contests for good, and were reckoned friends of God, and prophets.    What need had they of the commandments of Moses, which were given to weak and sinful men?    From all this it is abundantly proved that the Word of God announced to all nations the ancient form of their ancestors' religion,  as  the  new covenant does   not differ from the form of holiness, which was very ancient even in the time of Moses, so that it is at the same time both old and new.    It is, as I have shown, very, very old; and, on the other hand, it is new through having been as it were hidden away from men through a long period between, and now come to life again by the Saviour's teaching.
</P>
<P>
And it was in this intermediate period, while the ideal of the new covenant was hidden from men, and as it were asleep, that the law of Moses was interposed in the interval. It was like a nurse and governess of childish and imperfect souls. It was like a doctor to heal the whole Jewish race, worn away by the terrible disease of Egypt. As such it offered a lower and less perfect way of life to the children of Abraham, who were too weak to follow in the steps of their forefathers. For through their long sojourn in Egypt, after the death of their godly forefathers, they adopted Egyptian customs, and, as I said, fell into idolatrous superstition. They aimed no higher than the Egyptians, they became in all respects like them, both in worshipping idols,
<A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A>
and in other matters. Moses tore them from their godless polytheism, he led them back to God, the Creator of all things; he drew them up as it were from an abyss of evil, but it was natural for him to build first this step of holiness at the threshold and entrance of the Temple of the more Perfect. Therefore he forbade them to murder, to commit adultery, to steal, to swear falsely, to work uncleanness, to lie with mother, sister or daughter, to do many actions which till then they had done without restraint. He rescued them from their wild and savage life, and gave them a polity based on better reason and good law as the times went, and was the first lawgiver to codify his enactments in writing, a practice which was not yet known to all men. He dealt with them as imperfect, and when he forbade idolatry, he commanded them to worship the One Omnipotent God by sacrifices and bodily ceremonies. He enacted that they should conduct by certain mystic symbols the ritual that he ordained, which the Holy Spirit taught him in a wonderful way was only to be temporary: he drew a circle round one place and forbade them to celebrate his ordinances anywhere, except in one place alone, namely at the Temple in Jerusalem, and never outside it. And to this day it is forbidden for the children of the Hebrews outside the boundaries of their ruined mother-city to sacrifice according to the law, to build a temple or an altnr, to anoint kings or priests, to celebrate the Mosaic gatherings and feasts, to be cleansed from pollution, to be loosed from offences, to bear gifts to God, or to propitiate Him according to the legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
And therefore, of course, they have fallen under Moses' curse, attempting to keep it in part, but breaking it in the whole, as Moses makes absolutely clear:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Accursed is he, who does not continue in all the things written in this law, to do them.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And they have come to this <I>impasse, </I>although Moses himself foresaw by the Holy Spirit, that, when the new covenant was revived by Christ and preached to all nations, his own legislation would become superfluous, he rightly confined its influence to one place, so that if they were ever deprived
<A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A>
of it, and shut out of their national freedom, it might not be possible for them to carry out the ordinances of his law in a foreign country, and as of necessity they would have to receive the new covenant announced by Christ. Moses had foretold this very thing, and in due course Christ sojourned in this life, and the teaching of the new covenant was borne to all nations, and at once the Romans besieged Jerusalem, and destroyed it and the Temple there. At once the whole of the Mosaic law was abolished, with all that remained of the old covenant, and the curse passed over to those who became lawbreakers, because they obeyed Moses' law, when its time had gone by, and still clung ardently to it, for at that very moment the perfect teaching of the new Law was introduced in its place. And, therefore, our Lord and Saviour rightly says to those who suppose that God ought only to be worshipped in Jerusalem, or in certain mountains, or some definite places:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;1<I>. </I>The hour cometh and now is, when the true worshippers shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father. For God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
So He said, and presently, not long after, Jerusalem was besieged, the holy place and the altar by it and the worship conducted according to Moses' ordinances were destroyed, and the archetypal holiness of the pre-Mosaic men of God reappeared. And the blessing assured thereby to all nations came, to lead those who came to it from the first step and from the first elements of the Mosaic worship to a better and more perfect life. Yes, the religion of those blessed and godly men, who did not worship in any one place exclusively, neither by symbols nor types, but as our Lord and Saviour requires &quot;in spirit and in truth,&quot; by our Saviour's appearance became the possession of all the nations, as the prophets of old foresaw. For Zephaniah says the very same thing:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;The Lord shall appear against them, and shall utterly destroy all the gods of the nations of the earth.
<A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A>
And  they shall worship him  each  one from his own place.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Malachi as well contends against those of the circumcision, and speaks on behalf of the Gentiles, when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;10. I have no pleasure (in you), saith the Lord Almighty, and I will not accept a sacrifice at your hands. 11. For from the rising of the sun even to the setting my name has been glorified among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
By &quot;the incense and offering to be offered to God in every place,&quot;what else can he mean, but that no longer in Jerusalem nor exclusively in that (sacred) place, but in every land and among all nations they will offer to the Supreme God the, incense of prayer and the sacrifice called &quot;pure,&quot; because it is not a sacrifice of blood but of good works? And Isaiah literally shouts and cries his prophecy to the same effect:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;19. There shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt. . . . And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians ... 20. And he shall send to them a man who shall save them, . . . 21, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall offer sacrifice, and vow vows to the Lord and pay (them). And they shall he turned to the Lord, and he shall hear them and heal them.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Do we not say truly then that the prophets were inspired to foretell a change of the Mosaic Law, nay its end and conclusion? Moses lays down that the altar and the
<A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A>
sacrifices should be nowhere else on earth but in Judaea, and there only in one city. But this prophecy says that an altar to the Lord shall be set up in Egypt, and that Egyptians shall celebrate their sacrifices to the Lord of the prophets and no longer to their ancestral gods. It foretells that Moses shall not be the medium of their knowledge of God, nor any other of the prophets, but a man fresh and new sent from God. Now if the altar is changed contrary to the commandment of Moses, it is beyond doubt necessary that the Law of Moses should be changed also. Then, too, the Egyptians, if they &quot;sacrifice to the Supreme God,&quot; must be admittedly worthy of the priesthood. And if the Egyptians are priests Moses' enactments about the Levites and the Aaronic succession would be useless to the Egyptians. The time, therefore, will have come when a new legislation will be needed for their support. What follows? Have I<I> </I>spoken at random? Or have I proved my contention? Behold how to day, yes in our own times, our eyes see not only Egyptians, but every race of men who used to be idolaters, whom the prophet meant when he said &quot;Egyptians,&quot; released from the errors of polytheism and the daemons, and calling on
<A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>
the God of the prophets! They pray no longer to lords many, but to one Lord according to the sacred oracle; they have raised to Him an altar of unbloody and reasonable sacrifices according to the new mysteries of the fresh and new covenant throughout the whole of the inhabited world, and in Egypt itself and among the other nations, Egyptian in their superstitious errors. Yes, in our own time the knowledge of the Omnipotent God shines forth, and sets a seal of certainty on the forecasts of the prophets. You see this actually going on, you no longer only expect to hear of it, and if you ask the moment when the change began, for all your inquiry you will receive no other answer but the moment of the appearance of the Saviour. For He it was, of Whom the prophet spoke, when he said that the Supreme God and Lord would send a man to the Egyptians, to save them, as also the Mosaic oracles taught in these words: &quot;A man shall come forth from his seed, and shall rule over many nations&quot;; among which nations the Egyptians would certainly be numbered. But a great deal could be said on these points, and with sufficient leisure one could deal with them more exhaustively. Suffice it to say now, that we must hold to the truth, that the prophecies have only been fulfilled after the coming of Jesus our Saviour. For it is through Him that in our day that old system of Abraham, the most ancient and venerable form of religion, is followed by the Egyptians, the Persians, the Syrians and the Armenians. The Barbarians from the end of the earth, those of them who were of old the most uncivilized and wild, yea, they that inhabit the isles, for prophecy thought well even to mention them, follow it as well. And who would not be struck by the extraordinary change&#8212;that men who for ages have paid divine honour to wood and stone and daemons, wild beasts that feed on human flesh, poisonous reptiles, animals of every kind, repulsive monsters, fire and earth, and the lifeless elements of the universe should after our Saviour's coming pray to the
<A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A>
Most High God, Creator of Heaven and earth, the actual Lord of the prophets, and the God of Abraham and his forefathers? That men a little while before involved in marriage with mothers and daughters, in unspeakable vice and all sorts of vileness, men who lived like wild beasts, now converted by the divine power of our Saviour, and become like different beings, should crowd the public schools and learn lessons of virtue and purity. That not men only, but women, poor and rich, learned and simple, children even and slaves, should be taught in their daily occupation in town or country the loftiest ethics, which forbids to look with eyes unbridled, to be careless even in words, or to follow the path of custom and fashion. That they should learn the true ideal of worshipping the Supreme God, and serving Him in every place, according to the prophecy, which says: &quot;And they shall worship Him each from his own place.&quot;Every one, then, whether Greek or Barbarian, is worshipping the Supreme God, not running to lerusalem, nor made holy with bloody sacrifices, but staying at home in his own land, and offering in spirit and in truth his pure and bloodless offering. And theirs is the new covenant, not according to the old. Do not allow the covenant of the pre-Mosaic Saints to be called &quot;the old covenant,&quot;but that which was given to the Jews by the Law of Moses. For the text which says that the new will be quite unlike the old clearly implies which one was the old:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;I will make   a new covenant,  not according to the covenant   I   made with  their   fathers, in the day
that I took   them by the hand  to lead them out of Egypt.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Not according to the covenant of the Mosaic Law,&quot;he says. For that was introduced to the Jews at the exodus from Egypt. It might have seemed that he was introducing a new covenant opposed to the religious ideals of the Abrahamic Saints, if he had not distinctly said:
</P>
<P>
&quot;Not according to the covenant, which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand
to lead them out of Egypt.&quot; <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
He  prophesied  that the   new covenant would   not be
according to the one enacted at the time of the Exodus
and the wanderings in the wilderness, hut according to the
ancient one under which the pre-Mosaic saints flourished.
And, therefore, for the future you may confidently classify
the ideals   of religions  worshippers under  three  heads,
not two: the completely idolatrous, who have fallen into
the errors of polytheism; those of the circumcision, who
by   the  aid   of   Moses   have reached   the   first   step   of
holiness;  and thirdly, those who have ascended   by the
stair of Gospel teaching.     If you regard this as a mean
between the   other two, you will no longer suppose that
perverts from Judaism necessarily fall into Hellenism, nor
that  those  that  forsake   Hellenism  are,   therefore,   Jews.
Recognizing the third division in the middle, you will see
it standing up on high, as if it were set on a very lofty
mountain ridge, with the others left below on each side of the height.     For as it has escaped Greek godlessness,
error, superstition,  unbridled lust and disorder, so it has
left behind Jewish unprofitable observances, designed  by
Moses to meet the needs of those who were like infants
and invalids.    And as it stands on high, hear what it says
as it proclaims the   law, which suits not Jews alone, but Greeks and barbarians, and all nations under the sun:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;O man!   and all  the   human race!   the   Law of
Moses, beginning from one race of men, first called the
whole race of the Jews, because of the promise given
to their holy forefathers, to the knowledge of the one
God, and released its servants from bitter slavery to the
daemons.    But I am the herald to all men and to the
nations of the whole world of a loftier knowledge of
God and holiness; I call them to live according to the
ideals of those of Abraham's day, and men still  more
ancient of pre-Mosaic date, with whom many of all races
are recorded to have shone in holiness as lights in the world.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
The Law of Moses required all who desired to be holy to speed from all directions to one definite place; but I, giving freedom to all, teach men not to look for
<A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|41</SPAN></A>
God in a corner of the earth, nor in mountains, nor in temples made with hands, but that each should worship and adore Him at home.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
The old law commanded that God should be worshipped by the sacrifice of slain beasts, of incense and fire and divers other similar external purifications. Hut I, introducing the rites of the soul, command that God should be glorified with a clean heart and a pure mind, in purity and a life of virtue, and by true and holy teaching.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Moses forbade the men of his time who were defiled with blood to kill; but I lay down a more perfect law for those who have him for a schoolmaster and have kept the earlier commandment&#8212;when I ordain that men must not be slaves to anger.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And once more:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
The Law of Moses enacted to adulterers and the impure that they must not commit adultery, or indulge in vice, or pursue unnatural pleasures, and made death the penalty of transgression; but I do not wish my disciples even to look upon a woman with lustful desire.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again, it said:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Thou shall not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths; but I say unto you, Swear not at all, but let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again, it commanded resistance  against the unjust,
and reprisal, when it said:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thec on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And he who will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again, it exhorts to love your friend, and to hate your enemies; but I in my excess of goodwill and forbearance
lay down the law:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Pray for   persecutors,   that  you  may  be   children <A NAME="p42"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|42</SPAN></A>
of your Father in heaven, who letteth his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And, moreover, the Mosaic Law was suited to the hardness of heart of the vulgar, gave ordinances corresponding to those under the rule of sense, and provided a form of religion, reduced and inferior to the old. But I summon all to the holy and godly life of the holy men of the earlier days. And in fine, it promises, as to children, a land flowing with milk and honey, while I make citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven those who are worthy to enter therein.
</P>
<P>
Such was the message to all nations given by the word of the new covenant by the teaching of Christ. And the Christ of God bade His disciples teach them to all nations, saying:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Go ye into all the world, and make disciples of all the nations . . . teaching them to observe whatsoever I have commanded you.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And in giving them to all men both Greeks and barbarians to keep He clearly revealed the nature of Christianity, the nature of Christians, and the nature of the Teacher of the words and instruction, our Lord and Saviour the Christ of God Himself. He set up this new and perfect system throughout the whole world, that such teaching and such wisdom might be the food, not only of men but of women, of rich and poor alike, and of slaves with their masters. And yet the introducer of this new law is represented as having lived in all ways according to the Law of Moses. And this is a wonderful fact, that though He was going to come forward as the legislator of a new polity, according to the Gospel of His new covenant, He did not revolt from Moses as opposed to him and contrary. If He had thought good to command things opposed to Moses, He would have afforded to godless sectaries against Moses and the prophets material for much scandal, and to those of the circumcision a specious handle for attacking Him, particularly in view of the fact that they actually contrived their plot against His life as a transgressor and breaker of the law.
<A NAME="p43"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|43</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P align="center">
<b>
CHAPTER  7</b>
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<I>How Christ, having first fulfilled the Law of Moses, became the Introducer of a New and Fresh System.</I>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
AND now having lived in all ways according to the Law of Moses, He made use of His Apostles as ministers of the new legislation, on the one hand teaching them that they must not consider the Law of Moses either foreign or unfriendly to their own religion, on the other as being the author and introducer of a legislation new and salutary for all men, so that He did not in any way break Moses' enactments, but rather crowned them, and was their fulfilment, and then passed on to the institution of the Gospel Law. Hear Him speaking in this strain:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
3. &quot;I have not come to destroy the law but to fulfil it.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
For if He had been a transgressor of the Law of Moses, He would reasonably have been considered to have rescinded it and given a contrary law: and if He had been wicked and a law-breaker He could not have been believed to be the Christ. And if He had rescinded Moses' Law, He could never have been considered to be One foretold by Moses and the prophets. Nor would His new Law have had any authority. For He would have had to embark on a new Law, in order to escape the penalty of breaking the old. But as a matter of fact He has rescinded nothing

whatever in the Law, but fulfilled it. It is, as one might say, Mosaically perfect. Yet since it was no longer possible for the causes I have stated already to accommodate the Law of Moses to the needs of the other nations, and it was necessary, thanks to the love of God the All-good, &quot;that all men should be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth,&quot;<I><SUP> </SUP></I>He laid down a law suitable and possible for all. Nor did He forbid His Apostles to preach Moses' Law to all men, except when it was likely to be a stumbling-block to them, as the apostle says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;For that which was impossible by the law, in that it was weak, God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh,&quot; etc.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And it was &quot;impossible &quot;for all the nations to go up thrice a year to Jerusalem as the Law of Moses required, for a woman after childbirth to hasten there from the ends of the earth to pay the fees of her purification, and in many other ways, which you can arrive at for yourselves at your leisure. Since then it was not possible for the nations living outside Judaea to keep these things even if they wished, our Lord and Saviour could hardly be said to have rescinded them, but was the fulfilment of the Law, and gave a proof to those who could see, that He was indeed the Christ of God foretold by the old Jewish prophets. This He did, when He gave to all nations through His own disciples enactments that suited them. And, therefore, we reject Jewish customs, on the ground that they were not laid down for us, and that it is impossible to accommodate them to the needs of the Gentiles, while we gladly accept the Jewish prophecies as containing predictions about ourselves. Thus the Saviour on the one side is our teacher, and on the other the fulfilment of the Law of Moses, and of the prophets who followed him.
</P>
<P>
For since as yet the prophecies lacked the fulfilment of their conclusions and of their words, He must necessarily fulfil them. As for example the prophecy in Moses says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you like unto me, him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever that prophet shall speak to you.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
He fulfilled what remained to be fulfilled in this prophecy, <A NAME="p45"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|45</SPAN></A>
appearing as the second Lawgiver after Moses, giving to men the Law of the Supreme God's true holiness. For Moses does not say simply &quot;a prophet,&quot;but adds &quot;like unto me&quot;: (&quot;For a prophet,&quot; he says, &quot;shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me. Him shall ye hear&quot;), and this can only menu that He who was foretold would be equal to Moses. And Moses was the giver of the Law of holiness of the Supreme God. So He that was foretold, to be like Moses, would probably be like him in being a Lawgiver. And though there were many prophets in later days, none of them is recorded to have been &quot;like Moses.&quot;
</P>
<P>
For they all referred their hearers to him. Even Scripture bears witness that &quot;a prophet has not arisen like Moses&quot;: neither Jeremiah, nor Isaiah, nor any other of the prophets was like him, because not one of them was a Lawgiver. When the expectation was that a prophet who was also a Lawgiver like Moses should arise, Jesus Christ came giving a Law to all nations, and accomplishing what the Law could not. As He said:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;it was said to  them  of old time,  Thou  shalt not commit adultery:  but I say unto you, Thou shalt not desire to.&quot;   And,   &quot;It  was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill, but I say unto you, Thou shalt not be angry.&quot;   And, &quot;No more in  Jerusalem, but in every place must you worship.&quot;   And, &quot;Worship not with incense and sacrifices, but in spirit and in truth.&quot;<I>   </I>And all such things that are recorded of His teaching are surely the   laws  of a  Lawgiver  very wise  and   very perfect.&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Wherefore   Holy   Scripture   says   His   hearers   were  &quot;astounded,&quot; because He taught them &quot;as one having authority,   and   not   as   the  Scribes and  the   Pharisees&quot;&#8212;an oracle which supplied what was lacking to the fulfilment of the prophecy of Moses.    And the same can be said of the  other  prophecies about  Him,  and the calling of the Gentiles.    He was, therefore, the fulfiller of the  Law and the  prophets since   He  brought   the predictions referring to Himself to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He ordained that the former Law should stand till He came, and He was revealed as the originator of the second Law of the new covenant preached to all nations, as being
<A NAME="p46"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|46</SPAN></A>
responsible for the Law and influence of the two religions, I mean Judaism and Christianity. And it is wonderful that divine prophecy should accord:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, choice, a cornerstone; precious, and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Who could be the corner-stone but He, the living and precious stone Who supports by His teaching two buildings and makes them one? For He set up the Mosaic building, which was to last till His day, and then fitted on to one side of it our building of the Gospel. Hence He is called the corner-stone. And it is said in the Psalms: &quot;22. The stone which the builders refused, the same is become the head of the corner. 23. This is of the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes.&quot;
</P>
<P>
This oracle too indubitably indicates the Jewish conspiracy against the subject of the prophecy, how He has been set at naught by the builders of the old wall, meaning the Scribes and Pharisees, the High-Priests and all the rulers of the Jews. And it prophesied that though He should be despised and cast out He would become the head of the corner, regarding Him as the originator of the new covenant, according to the above proofs.
</P>
<P>
So then we are not apostates from Hellenism who have embraced Judaism, nor are we at fault in accepting the law of Moses and the Hebrew Prophets, and we do not live as Jews, but according to the system of the men of God who lived before Moses. Nay, we claim that in this
<A NAME="p47"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|47</SPAN></A>
we authenticate Moses and the succeeding prophets, in that we accept the Christ foretold by them, and obey His laws, and endeavour prayerfully to tread in the steps of His teaching, for so we do what Moses himself would approve. For he says, in foretelling that God will raise up a prophet like himself, &quot;and every soul which doth not hear that prophet shall be cast out from its race.&quot;Therefore the Jews, because they rejected the prophet, and did not hearken to His holy words, have suffered extreme ruin according to the prediction. For they neither received the law of Christ of the new covenant, nor were they able to keep the commands of Moses without some breach of his law; and so they fell under the curse of Moses, in not being able to carry out what was ordained by him, being exiled as they were from their mother-city, which was destroyed, where alone it was allowed to celebrate the Mosaic worship. Whereas we, who accept Him that was foretold by Moses and the prophets, and endeavour to obey Him prayerfully, must surely be fulfilling the prophecy of Moses, where he said: &quot;And every soul, which doth not hear that prophet, shall be cast out from its race.&quot;And we heard just now what the ordinances of the prophet were, which we must obey, their wisdom, perfection and heavenliness, which he thought fit to inscribe, not on tables of stone like Moses, nor yet with ink and parchment, but on the hearts of his pupils, purified and open to reason. On them he wrote the laws of the new covenant, and actually fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;I will make a new covenant, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers. For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel, I will give my laws into their mind, and upon their heart I will write them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

CHAPTER 8&nbsp;</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
 <I>That the Christian Life is of Two Distinct Characters.</I>
</P>
<P>
THE one wrote on lifeless tables, the Other wrote the perfect commandments of the new covenant on living minds. And His disciples, accommodating their teaching to the minds of the people, according to the Master's will, delivered on the one hand to those who were able to receive it, the teaching given by the perfect master to those who rose above human nature. While on the other the side of the teaching which they considered was suitable to men still in the world of passion and needing treatment, they accommodated to the weakness of the majority, and handed over to them to keep sometimes in writing, and sometimes by unwritten ordinances to be observed by them. Two ways of life were thus given by the law of Christ to His Church. The one is above nature, and beyond common human living; it admits not marriage, child-bearing, property nor the possession of wealth, but wholly and permanently separate from the common customary life of mankind, it devotes itself to the service of God alone in its wealth of heavenly love!  And they who enter on this course, appear to die to the life of mortals, to bear with them nothing earthly but their body, and in mind and spirit to have passed to heaven. Like some celestial beings they gaze upon human life, performing the duty of a priesthood to Almighty God for the whole race, not with
<A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|49</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb> </SPAN>sacrifices of bulls and blood, nor with libations and unguents, nor with smoke and consuming fire and destruction of bodily things, but with right principles of true holiness, and of a soul purified in disposition, and above all with virtuous deeds and words; with such they propitiate the Divinity, and celebrate their priestly rites for themselves and their race. Such then is the perfect form of the Christian life. And the other more humble, more human, permits men to join in pure nuptials and to produce children, to undertake government, to give orders to soldiers fighting for right; it allows them to have minds for farming, for trade, and the other more secular interests
<A NAME="p50"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|50</SPAN></A>
as well as for religion: and it is for them that times of retreat and instruction, and days for hearing sacred things are set apart. And a kind of secondary grade of piety is attributed to them, giving just such help as such lives require, so that all men, whether Greeks or barbarians, have their part in the coming of salvation, and profit by the teaching of the Gospel.

<P align="center">
<b>
CHAPTER  9</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
<I>Why a Numerous Offspring is not as Great a Concern to us as it was to them of Old Time.</I>
</P>
<P>
This being so, the question naturally arises, if we claim that the Gospel teaching of our Saviour Christ bids us worship God as did the men of old, and the pre-Mosaic men of God, and that our religion is the same as theirs, and our knowledge of God the same, why were they keenly concerned with marriage and reproduction, while we to some extent disregard it? And again, why are they recorded as propitiating God with animal sacrifices, while we are forbidden to do so, and are told to regard it as impious. For those two things alone, which are by no means unimportant, would seem to conflict with what 1 have said; they would imply that in these matters we have not preserved the ancient ideal of religion. But it is possible for us to refute this charge by a study of the Hebrew writings. The men renowned for piety before Moses are recorded as having lived when human life was first beginning and organizing itself, while we live when it is nearing its end. And so they were anxious for the increase of their descendants, that men might multiply, that the human race might grow and flourish at that time, and reach its height; but these things are of little moment to us, who believe the world to be perishing and running down and reaching its last end, since it is expressly said that the gospel teaching will be at the door before the
<A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A> consummation of life, while a new creation and the birth of another age at no distant time is foretold. Such is one reply, and this is a second. The men of old days lived an easier and a freer life, and their care of home and family did not compete with their leisure for religion; they were able to worship (iod without distraction from their wives and children and domestic cares, and were in no way drawn by external things from the things that mattered most.<SUP> </SUP>But in our days there are many external interests that draw us away, and involve us in uncongenial thoughts, and seduce us from our zeal for the things which please God. The word of the Gospel teaching certainly gives this as the cause of the limitation of marriage, when it says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
29. But this 1 say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth that they who have wives be as though they had none. 30. And those that wept as though they wept not, and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy as though they possessed not; 31. and they that use this world as not abusing it, for the fashion of this world passeth away. 32. But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he that is married careth for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is divided. 34. And the unmarried woman and the virgin careth for the things of the Lord how she may please the Lord),  that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 35. And this I speak for your profit; not that I may cast a cord upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
<A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
This expressly attributes the decrease of marriage to the evils of the time and of external circumstances, such as did not affect the ancients.
</P>
<P>
And I might give this third reason why the godly men of old were so devoted to the procreation of children. The rest of mankind were increasing in evil, they had fallen into an uncivilized, inhuman, and savage mode of life, they had given themselves up completely to godlessness and impiety, while they themselves, a very scanty remnant, had divorced themselves from the life of the many, and from common association with other men. They were living apart from other nations and in isolation, and were organizing a new kind of polity; they were evolving a life of true wisdom and religion, unmingled with other men. They wished to hand on to posterity the fiery seed of their own religion; they did not intend that their piety should fail and perish when they themselves died, and so they had foresight for producing and rearing children. They knew they could be the teachers and guides of their families, and considered it their object to hand on to posterity the inheritance of their own good qualities. Hence many prophets and righteous men, yea, even our Lord and Saviour Himself, with His apostles and disciples, have come from their line.
</P>
<P>
And if some of them turned out wicked, like straw growing up with the corn, we must not blame the sowers, nor those who tended the crop, just as we should admit that even some of our Saviour's disciples have erred from the right way through self-will. And this explanation of the ancient men of God begetting children cannot be said to apply to the Christians to-day, when by God's help through our Saviour's Gospel teaching we can see with our own eyes many peoples and nations in city and country and field all hastening together, and united in running to learn the godly course of the teaching of the Gospel, for whom I am glad to say we are able to provide teachers and preachers of the word of holiness, free from all ties of life and anxious thoughts. And in our day these men are necessarily devoted to
<A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A>
celibacy that they may have leisure for higher things; they have undertaken to bring up not one or two children but a prodigious number, and to educate them in godliness, and to care for their life generally. On the top of all this, if we carefully examine the lives of the ancient men of whom I am speaking, we shall find that they had children in early life, but later on abstained and ceased from having them. For it is written that &quot;Enoch pleased God after Methusaleh was born.&quot; Scripture expressly records that he pleased God after the birth of his son, and tells nothing of his having children afterwards. And Noah, that just man, who was saved alone with his family when the whole world was destroyed, after the birth of his children, though he lived many years more, is not related to have begotten more children. And Isaac is said, after becoming the father of twins by one wife, to have ceased cohabitation with her. Joseph again (and this was when he lived among the Egyptians) was only the father of two sons, and married to their mother only, while Moses himself and Aaron his brother are recorded as having had children before the appearance of God, but after the giving of the divine oracles as having begotten no more children. What must I say of Melchisedek? He had no son at all, no family, no descendants. And the same is true of Joshua, the successor of Moses, and many other prophets.
</P>
<P>
If there is any question about the families of Abraham and Jacob, a longer discussion will be found in the book I wrote about the polygamy and large families of the ancient men of God. To this I must refer the student, only warning him that according to the laws of the new covenant the producing of children is certainly not forbidden, but the provisions are similar to those followed by the ancient men of God. &quot;For a bishop,&quot; says the Scripture, &quot;must be the husband of one wife.&quot; Yet it is fitting that
<A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A>
those in the priesthood and occupied in the service of God, should abstain after ordination from the intercourse of marriage. To all who have not undertaken this wondrous priesthood, Scripture almost completely gives way, when it says: &quot;Marriage is honourable, and the bed undefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.&quot; This, then, is my answer to the first question.

<b>
CHAPTER  10</b>
</P>
<P align="center">
<I>Why we are not bidden to</I> <I>burn Incense and to sacrifice the Fruits of the Earth to God as were the Men of Old Time.</I>
</P>
<P>
I SHOULD give the following reply to those who ask why we do not sacrifice animals to Almighty God, as the men of God of old did, whom we claim to imitate. Greek ideas, and what is actually found in the sacred books of the Hebrews, do not agree about the <I>cultus </I>of the ancient primitive men. The Greeks say that early men did not ever sacrifice animals, nor burn incense to the gods, but &quot;herbage, which they lifted up in their hands as the bloom of the productive power of nature,&quot; and burnt grass and leaves and roots in the fire to the sun and the stars of heaven. And that in the next stage men launching far into wickedness stained the altars with the sacrifice of animals, and that this was a sacrifice sinful, unrighteous, and quite displeasing to God. For man and beast in no way differ in their reasonable soul. So they said that those who offer animals are open to the charge of murder, the soul being one and the same in man and brute. This was the view of the ancient Greeks, but it does not agree with the Hebrew Scriptures. They record that the first men, as soon as they
<A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A>
were created, honoured  God with animal sacrifices at the very creation of their life.    For they say:&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And it came to pass after some  days that   Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord.
And Abel also brought of the first-born of his sheep.. . . And God looked upon Abel and his gifts.    But
Cain and his sacrifices be regarded not.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Here you will understand that he who sacrificed an animal is said to have been more accepted by God than he who brought an offering of the fruits of the earth. Noah again brought to the altar his first-fruits of all clean cattle, and of all clean fowls; Abraham also is described as sacrificing: so that if we accept the evidence of Holy Scripture, the first sacrifices thought of by the ancient men of God were those of animals.
</P>
<P>
And this thought, I hold, was not due to accident, nor was its source in man, but it was divinely suggested. For when they saw since they were holy, brought nigh to God, and enlightened by the Divine Spirit in their souls that there was need of great stress on the cleansing of the sons of men, they thought that a ransom was due to the source<SUP> </SUP>of life and soul in return for their own salvation. And then as they had nothing better or more valuable than their own life to sacrifice, in place of it they brought a sacrifice through that of the unreasoning beasts, providing a life instead of their own life. They did not consider this was sinful or unrighteous. They had not been taught that the soul of the brutes was like man's, which has discourse of reason: they had only learned that it was the animal's blood, and that in the blood is the principle of life, which they offered themselves, sacrificing as it were to God one life instead of another.
<A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
Moses makes this abundantly clear, when he says:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;For the life of all flesh is the blood, and I have
given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for
your sins: for the blood shall make atonement for the
soul.    Therefore I said to  the children of Israel, No
soul of you shall eat blood.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Note carefully in the above the words, &quot;I gave to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for the blood shall make atonement for the soul.&quot;
</P>
<P>
He says clearly that the blood of the victims slain is a propitiation in the place of human life. And the law about sacrifices suggests that it should be so regarded, if it is carefully considered. For it requires him who is sacrificing always to lay his hands on the head of the victim, and to bear the animal to the priest held by its head, as one offering a sacrifice on behalf of himself. Thus he says in each case:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;He shall bring it before the Lord.    And he shall lay his hands on the head of the gift.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Such is the ritual in every case, no sacrifice is ever brought up otherwise. And so the argument holds that the victims are brought in place of the lives of them who bring them. In teaching that the blood of the brutes is their life, it in no way implies that they share in the essence of thought and reason, for they are composed of matter and body, in the same way as the vegetation of the earth and plants. Thus Moses tells that God said in one creative word:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Let  the  earth  bring  forth  herb  of grass and   the fruit tree.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again in like manner:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Let  the  earth   bring forth  four-footed  things,  and creeping things, and wild beasts of the earth
after their kind.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
We must, therefore, regard the brutes as akin in kind and nature and essence to the vegetation of the earth and the plants, and conclude that those who sacrifice them commit no sin. Noah indeed was told to eat flesh, as the herb of the field.
</P>
<P>
While then the better, the great and worthy and divine sacrifice was not yet available for men, it was necessary for
<A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A>
them by the offering of animals to pay a ransom for their own life, and this was fitly a life that represented their own nature. Thus did the holy men of old, anticipating by the Holy Spirit that a holy victim, dear to God and great, would one day come for men, as the offering for the sins of the world, believing that as prophets they must perform in symbol his sacrifice, and shew forth in type what was yet to be. But when that which was perfect was come, in accordance with the predictions of the prophets, the former sacrifices ceased at once because of the better and true Sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
This Sacrifice was the Christ of God, from far distant times foretold as coming to men, to be sacrificed like a sheep for the whole human race. As Isaiah the prophet says of him:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;As a sheep he was led to slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before her shearers.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he adds:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;4. He bears our sins and is pained for us; yet we accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffering and in affliction. 5. Hut he was wounded on account of our sins, and he was made sick on account of our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripe we are healed. ... 6. And the Lord hath given him up for our iniquities ... .9 for he did no sin himself, nor was guile found in his mouth.''
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Jeremiah, another Hebrew prophet, speaks similarly in the person of Christ: &quot;I was led as a lamb to the slaughter.&quot;
</P>
<P>
John Baptist sets the seal on their predictions at the appearance of our Saviour. For beholding Him, and pointing Him out to those present as the one foretold by the prophets, he cried: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.''
</P>
<P>
Since then according to the witness of the prophets the great and precious ransom has been found for Jews and Greeks alike, the propitiation for the whole world, the life given for the life of all men, the pure offering for every stain and sin, the Lamb of God, the holy sheep dear
to God, the Lamb that was foretold, by Whose inspired and mystic teaching all we Gentiles have procured the forgive ness of our former sins, and such Jews as hope in Him
<A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A>
are freed from the curse of Moses, daily celebrating His memorial, the remembrance of His Body and Blood, and are admitted to a greater sacrifice than that of the ancient law, we do not reckon it right to fall back upon the first beggarly elements, which are symbols and likenesses but do not contain the truth itself. And any Jews, of course, who have taken refuge in Christ, even if they attend no longer to the ordinances of Moses, but live according to the new covenant, are free from the curse ordained by Moses, for the Lamb of God has surely not only taken on Himself the sin of the world, but also the curse involved in the breach of the commandments of Moses as well. The Lamb of God is made thus both sin and curse&#8212;sin for the sinners in the world, and curse for those remaining in all the things written in Moses' law. And so the Apostle says: &quot;Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us&quot;; and &quot;Him that knew no sin, for our sakes he made sin.&quot;For what is there that the Offering for the whole world could not effect, the Life given for the life of sinners, Who was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a lamb to the sacrifice, and all this for us and on our behalf? And this was why those ancient men of God, as they had not yet the reality, held fast to their symbols. This is exactly what our Saviour teaches, saying:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them;
and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And we, who have received both the truth, and the archetypes of the early copies through the mysterious dispensation of Christ, can have no further need for the things of old.
<A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
He then that was alone of those who ever existed, the Word of God, before all worlds, and High Priest of every creature that has mind and reason, separated One of like passions with us, as a sheep or lamb from the human flock, branded on Him all our sins, and fastened on Hirn as well the curse that was adjudged by Moses' law, as Moses foretells: &quot;Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.&quot;
This He suffered &quot;being made a curse for us; and making himself sin for our sakes.&quot;And then &quot;He made him sin for our sakes who knew no sin,&quot;and laid on Him all the punishments due to us for our sins, bonds, insults, contumelies, scourging, and shameful blows, and the crowning trophy of the Cross. And after all this when He had offered such a wondrous offering and choice victim to the Father, and sacrificed for the salvation of us all, He delivered a memorial to us to offer to God continually instead of a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
This also the wondrous David inspired by the Holy Spirit to foresee the future, foretold in these words:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me |, and heard my calling |. 2. And he brought me up out of a pit of misery |, and from miry clay |. And he set my feet on a rock | and ordered my steps aright |. 3. And he hath put a new song in my mouth |, a hymn to our God. |&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he shews clearly what &quot;the new song&quot; is when he goes on to say:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;7. Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not  ; <A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A>
but
a body hast them prepared me |; whole burnt-offering;
and sin offering thou didst take no pleasure in  |.   8. Then
said I, Lo, I come:  | in the volume of the book it is
written of me |, to do thy will, O God, I desired.   |&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And he adds: &quot;I have preached righteousness in the great
congregation.&quot;   He   plainly teaches that   in place  of the
ancient sacrifices and whole  burnt-offerings the  incarnate
presence of Christ that  was prepared was offered.    And
this very thing He proclaims to his Church as a great mystery
expressed with prophetic voice in the volume of the book.
As we have received a memorial of this offering which we
celebrate on a table by means of symbols of His Body and
saving Blood according to the laws of the new covenant,
we are taught again by the prophet David to say:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;5. Thou hast prepared a  table before me  in  the face of my persecutors |.    Thou hast anointed my head
with  oil |, and  thy cup cheers  me   as   the  strongest (wine). |&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Here it is plainly the mystic Chrism  and the holy Sacrifices <A NAME="p61"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|61</SPAN></A>
of Christ's Table that are meant, by which we are taught to offer to Almighty God through our great High Priest all through our life the celebration of our sacrifices, bloodless, reasonable, and well-pleasing to Him. And this very thing the great prophet Isaiah wonderfully foreknew by the Holy Spirit, and foretold. And he therefore says thus:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;O Lord, my God, I will glorify thee, I will hymn thy name, for thou hast done marvellous things.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And  he goes on  to explain what  these  things   so  truly &quot;wonderful&quot; are:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;And the Lord of Sabaoth shall make a feast for all the nations.     They shall drink joy,  they shall drink wine,  they  shall   be  anointed  with   myrrh  (on   this mountain).   Impart thou all these things to the nations. For this is God's counsel upon all the nations.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
These were Isaiah's &quot;wonders.&quot;the promise of the anointing with ointment of a good smell, and with myrrh made not to Israel but to all nations.    Whence not unnaturally through   the  chrism of myrrh  they gained  the   name of Christians.    But he also prophesies the &quot;wine of joy &quot;to the nations, darkly alluding to the sacrament of the new covenant of Christ, which is now openly celebrated among the nations.    And these unembodied and spiritual sacrifices the  oracle   of  the prophet  also  proclaims,   in  a  certain place:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Offer to God the sacrifice of praise, and give the Highest thy vows: And call upon me in the clay of thy affliction, and I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And again:&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
 &quot;The lifting up of my hands is an evening sacrifice.&quot;And once more: &quot;The sacrifice of God is a contrite spirit.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
And so all these predictions of immemorial prophecy are being fulfilled at this present time through the teaching of our Saviour among all nations. Truth bears witness with the prophetic voice with which God, rejecting the Mosaic sacrifices, foretells that the future lies with us:
<A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Wherefore from the rising of the sun unto the setting my name shall be glorified among the nations. And in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
We sacrifice, therefore, to Almighty God a sacrifice of praise. We sacrifice the divine and holy and sacred offering. We sacrifice anew according to the new covenant the pure sacrifice. But the sacrifice to God is called &quot;a contrite heart.&quot;&quot;A humble and a contrite heart thou wilt not despise.&quot;Yes, and we offer the incense of the prophet, in every place bringing to Him the sweet-smelling fruit of the sincere Word of God, offering it in our prayers to Him. This yet another prophet teaches, who says: &quot;Let my prayer be as incense in thy sight.&quot;
</P>
<P>
So, then, we sacrifice and offer incense: On the one hand when we celebrate the Memorial of His great Sacrifice according to the Mysteries He delivered to us, and bring to God the Eucharist for our salvation with holy hymns and prayers; while on the other we consecrate ourselves to Him alone and to the Word His High Priest, devoted to Him in body and soul. Therefore we are careful to keep our bodies pure and undefiled from all evil, and we bring our hearts purified from every passion and stain of sin, and worship Him with sincere thoughts, real intention, and true beliefs. For these arc more acceptable to Him, so we are taught, than a multitude of sacrifices offered with blood and smoke and fat.

begins.&nbsp; Up to this point we are dependent on the edition of the lost
Mavrocordato Codex by Fabricius and on his paging.&nbsp; The paging is now that
of Stephen and starts here as page 1.</p>
