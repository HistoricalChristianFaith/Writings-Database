<p align="left">THIS translation was published by SPCK in 1920 in two hardback
volumes.&nbsp; It was republished in 1981, and is currently in print in a single
volume paperback for $25,&nbsp; published by Wipf
&amp; Stock, March 2001, <span class="Sidetitles">ISBN: </span><span class="smallside"><font color="#000000">0927022494;
available from various sites online, although not Amazon, e.g. <a href="http://pentecostalpublishing.com/books/books_details.asp?product_id=5342&amp;subject=0">Pentecostal
Publishing</a>.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="smallside"><font color="#000000">This transcription
is not as complete as it might be.&nbsp; In particular, it omits the bible
references, almost all the footnotes, and a certain number of the references to
the Greek text.&nbsp; This is because it has been a struggle to transcribe.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"> Some months ago, a fellow-enthusiast for scanning patristic material, Peter
Kirby, mentioned online that he intended to scan the only English translation of
Eusebius' <i>Demonstratio Evangelica</i>.&nbsp;By coincidence, I had just
obtained a photocopy of the SPCK edition. As this was a work in which I
was interested, I contacted him and
offered my help.&nbsp; He began work on the introduction, while I scanned book 2
and sent it to him.&nbsp; Neither of us much enjoyed the experience.&nbsp; The SPCK edition was
hard to scan, and manual corrections of the interminable footnotes, and manually
incorporating the marginal scripture references and Greek edition codes took
forever.&nbsp; After these, Peter began work on Book 1, while I started on Book
3.&nbsp; Neither of us ever finished.&nbsp; Instead, more pressing (and achievable) tasks
were undertaken.&nbsp; However the intention remained, and a 2-inch deep pile of
photocopies on the side kept looking at me.</p>

<p align="left">On New Year's Eve 2002, I decided to try to place at least the English&nbsp;
text online.&nbsp; This could be scanned and proofed and formatted far more
quickly, ignoring marginal material, and all the footnotes.&nbsp; After all, I
felt, it
is better to have the text only, than nothing.&nbsp; This I have proceeded to
do, completing on the 3rd January 2003.</p>

<p align="left">Naturally I haven't discarded the material done so far.&nbsp; I
reformatted and completed the material scanned by Peter into the standard format
I use on these pages.&nbsp; I found that the book 2 text had actually been lost,
but fortunately a proofed but unformatted copy was still on my hard disk.&nbsp;
Likewise I used the material already proofed for book 3.&nbsp; I scanned book 1
myself, and experimented with marking up the Greek location numbers in
Green.&nbsp; I quickly found this slowed matters to a crawl, and desisted.&nbsp;
Greek text was a problem -- Peter had done his into HTML characters, while mine
was a mix of Symbol and SPIonic. [Now converted to unicode -- October 2005].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">All these inconsistencies remain in the scanned text.&nbsp; I
apologise for them.&nbsp; It would have been possible, but tedious, to remove
them.&nbsp; However, I felt that it was better to include material from
footnotes etc which was available, and put up with the incomplete nature of
it.&nbsp; The reader should be aware that, apart from the intro and book 2, the
selection of footnotes, scripture references, Greek locations is sporadic, and
its absence indicative of nothing but transcription difficulties.</p>

<p align="left">The footnotes are primarily in Greek, and consist of variants in
the biblical text, with that of Westcott &amp; Hort.&nbsp; Other footnotes
consist of quotations from Shakespeare, or common-place comments on the
fathers.&nbsp; If you want the extra material, either contact me with an offer
of help, or else
support the reprint and buy a copy!&nbsp; The printed text is cheap, and much
handier than a pile of print-offs.</p>

<p align="left">I have included the SPCK catalogue of publications for
1920.&nbsp; It is useful to see a list of all this material, which is now in the
public domain, and it probably helps those looking for such things as English
translations of the Fathers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">I am aware that the quality of transcription is probably not all that high.&nbsp;
However, I do not believe that this text will appear online in the foreseeable
future, unless these
shortcuts are taken.&nbsp; I hope readers will be understanding; and if you find
errors, by all means send them in to me, <font COLOR="#FF0000"><a HREF="https://www.tertullian.org/feedback.php?page=eusebius_de"><u>Roger
