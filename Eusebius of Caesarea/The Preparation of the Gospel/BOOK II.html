<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>The theology of the Phoenicians is of the character described above, and the
word of salvation teaches us in the gospel to escape from it without looking
back, and earnestly to seek the remedy for this madness of the ancients.</p>
<p>Now it must be manifest that these are not fables and poetic fictions
containing some theory concealed in covert meanings, but true testimonies, as
they would say themselves, of ancient and wise theologians, comprising records
of earlier date than all poets and historians, and deriving the credibility of
their statements from the names and history of the gods prevailing to the
present day in the cities and villages of Phoenicia, and from the mysteries
celebrated among the inhabitants of each. This must be manifest, I say, from the
confession both of the other historians and especially of their reputed
theologians; for they hereby testified that the ancients who first composed the
account of the gods did not refer at all to figurative descriptions of physical
phenomena, nor make allegories of the myths concerning the gods, but preserved
the histories in their literal form. For this was shown by the words already
quoted of the authors whom I have mentioned; so that there is no longer need to
search up forced physical explanations, since the proof which the facts bring
with them of themselves is quite clear.</p>
<p>Such, then, is the theology of the Phoenicians. But it is time to pass on and
review that of the Egyptians also. in order to observe carefully and understand
exactly whether our revolt from them is not well judged and reasonable, and
whether it has not been successful upon the sole evidence of the gospel first of
all among the Egyptians themselves, and then among those also who are of like
mind with them.</p>
<p>Now the whole Egyptian history has been translated at large into the language
of the Greeks, and especially the part concerning their theology, by Manetho the
Egyptian, both in the <i>Sacred Book</i> written by him, and in other of his
works. Moreover, Diodorus, whom we mentioned before, collected his narratives
from many sources, and described the customs of the several nations with the
utmost possible accuracy: and being an eminent man, who had won no small
reputation for learning among all lovers of literature, and had made a
collection of all ancient history, and connected the earliest with the
subsequent events, he adopted the theology of the Egyptians as the commencement
of his whole treatise.</p>
<p>I think it better, therefore, to draw the representation of the subject
before us from that treatise, as his writings are likely to be better known to
the Greeks. This, then, is what he narrates word for word: <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>[DIODORUS] 'The Egyptians say that in the original creation of the universe mankind came
into existence first in Egypt by reason of its temperate climate and the nature
of the Nile. For as that river caused great fertility and supplied food self
grown, it gave an easy sustenance to the living creatures that were born.</p>
<p><A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> 'The gods, they say, had been originally mortal
men, but gained their immortality on account of wisdom and public benefits to
mankind, some of them having also become kings: and some have the same names,
when interpreted, with the heavenly deities, while others have received a name
of their own, as Helios, and Kronos, and Rhea, and Zeus, who is by some called
Ammon; and besides these Hera and Hephaestus, and Hestia, and lastly Hermes.</p>
<p>'Helios, they say, was the first king of the Egyptians, having the same name
with the celestial luminary: some, however, of the priests say that Hephaestus
was the first who became king, because he was the discoverer of fire.</p>
<p>'Kronos reigned next, and having married his sister Rhea begat, according to
some authors, Osiris and Isis. but according to most, Zeus and Hera, who for
their valour received the kingdom of the whole world. Of these were born five
gods, Osiris, and Isis, and Typhon, and Apollo, and Aphrodite. Osiris is
Dionysus, and Isis is Demeter; and Osiris, having married her and succeeded to
the kingdom, did many things for the general benefit, and founded in the Thebaid
a city of a hundred gates, which some called Diospolis, and others Thebes. . . .
<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A><sup> </sup>He also erected a temple to his parents
Zeus and Hera, and golden shrines of the other gods, to each of whom he assigned
honours, and appointed the priests to attend to them. Osiris also was the
discoverer of the vine, and was the first to make use of bare land, and to teach
the rest of mankind agriculture. Above all he honoured Hermes, who was endowed
with an excellent genius for contriving what might benefit the common life.</p>
<p><A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'For he was the inventor of letters,
and arranged sacrifices for the gods, and invented a lyre, and taught the Greeks
the explanation (&#949;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;) of
these matters, from which circumstance he was called Hermes. He also discovered
the olive-tree.</p>
<p><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'Osiris, after travelling over the
whole world, set up Busiris in Phoenicia, and Antaeus in Aethiopia and Libya;
and himself led an expedition with his brother Apollo, who, they say, was the
discoverer of the laurel. <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A><sup> </sup>In the
expedition with Osiris there went his two sons, Anubis and Macedon; and he took
with him also Pan, who is especially honoured by the Egyptians, and from whom
Panopolis is named.</p>
<p>'And when he was near Taphosiris the tribe of Satyrs was, brought to him:
and, being fond of music, he carried about with him a band of musicians, amongst
whom were nine maidens skilful in singing and well educated in other respects,
who among the Greeks are called Muses, and whose leader is Apollo. And since
every nation welcomed Osiris as a god because of the benefits bestowed by him,
he left memorials of himself behind him everywhere.</p>
<p><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'In India he founded not a few
cities; and also visited the other nations, those about Phrygia, and crossed the
Hellespont into Europe. <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><sup> </sup>His son Macedon
he left as king of Macedonia; and Triptolemus he put in charge of agriculture in
Attica.</p>
<p>'Afterwards he passed from among men to the gods, and from Isis and Hermes
received temples and all the honours which are, held among the gods to be most
distinguished. These two also taught men his initiatory rites, and introduced
many customs, concerning him in the way of mysteries.</p>
<p><A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'He was killed by Typhon his
brother, a wicked and impious, person, who, having divided the body of the
murdered man into, twenty-six parts, gave a portion to each of his accomplices
in the, assault, wishing all to share in the pollution.</p>
<p>'But Isis, being the sister and wife of Osiris, avenged the murder, with the
aid of her son Horus; and, having slain Typhon and his accomplices near what is
now called the village of Antaeus, she became queen of Egypt.</p>
<p>'And having found all except one part of the body of Osiris, they say that
round each part she moulded out of spices and wax the figure of a man
corresponding in size to Osiris, and gave them to the priests throughout all
Egypt to be worshipped: she also consecrated one of the animals found among
them, of whatever kind they wished.</p>
<p><A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'The sacred bulls, both Apis so
called, and Mnevis, were consecrated to Osiris, and all the Egyptians in common
were taught to worship them as gods, because these animals had helped the
labours of the discoverers of wheat, both in sowing and in the common course of
husbandry. <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Isis swore to accept the
company of no man any more; and when she herself had passed from among men, she
received immortal honours, and was buried at Memphis.</p>
<p>'So the parts of Osiris which had been found again are said to have been
honoured with burial in the manner described; but they say that the member which
had been cast into the river by Typhon was deemed worthy by Isis of divine
honours no less than the rest.</p>
<p>'For she set up an image of it in the temples, and instituted worship, and
made the initiations and sacrifices paid to this deity especially honourable.
And as the Greeks received their orgiastic rites and Dionysiac festivals from
Egypt, they also worship this member in their mysteries, and in the initiatory
rites and sacrifices of this god, and call it Phallus.</p>
<p><A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'But those who say that the god
was born in Boeotian Thebes of Semele and Zeus talk, they say, at random. For
when Orpheus had landed in Egypt and received initiation, he took part also in
the Dionysiac mysteries, and, being friendly to the Cadmeans and honoured by
them, he changed the place of the god's birth to please them; and the multitude,
partly through ignorance and partly from their desire that the god should be
called a Greek, gladly welcomed the initiations and mysteries.</p>
<p>'And for the transference of the birth and initiatory rites of the god
Orpheus found occasion as follows. Cadmus, a native of the Egyptian Thebes,
among other children begat Semele; and she having been violated by somebody or
other became pregnant, and after seven months gave birth to a child, just such
as the Egyptians consider Osiris to have been.</p>
<p>'And when the child died, Cadmus covered it with gold, and appointed the
proper sacrifices for it, and also assigned the fatherhood to Zeus, thus
magnifying Osiris, and taking away the reproach of the mother's seduction.</p>
<p>'Wherefore among the Greeks also a story was given out that Semele, the
daughter of Cadmus, gave birth to Osiris by Zeus.</p>
<p>'Afterwards when the mythologists came forward, the story filled the theatre,
and became to succeeding generations a strong and unalterable belief. And the
most illustrious heroes and gods of the Egyptians are, it is said, universally
claimed by the Greeks as their own.</p>
<p><A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'Hercules, for example, was by
birth an Egyptian, and moved by his valour travelled over much of the known
world: but the Greeks claimed him as their own, though in truth he was different
from the son of Alcmena who arose at some later time among the Greeks.</p>
<p>'Perseus also, it is said, was born in Egypt, and the birth of Isis was
transferred by the Greeks to Argos, while in their mythology they said that she
was lo, who was transformed into a cow: but some think the same deity to be
Isis, some Demeter, some Thesmophoros, but others Selene, and others Hera.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></p>
<p>'Osiris, too, some think to be Apis, and some Dionysus, some Pluto, some
Ammon, some Zeus, and others Pan.</p>
<p>'Isis, they say, was the discoverer of many remedies, and of medical science:
she also discovered the medicine of immortality, by which, when her son Horus
had been treacherously attacked by the Titans, and was found dead under the
water, she not only raised him up again and gave him life, but also made him
partake of immortality.</p>
<p><A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'Horus they say was the last of
the gods who reigned over Egypt, and his name by interpretation is Apollo: he
was taught medicine and soothsaying by his mother Isis, and benefited mankind by
his oracles and cures.</p>
<p>'Most authors agree that in the time of Isis certain giants of great size,
arrayed in monstrous fashion, stirred up war against the gods Zeus and Osiris.
Also that the Egyptians made it lawful to marry sisters, because Isis had been
married to Osiris her brother.'</p>
<p>Such are their stories about these deities: but concerning the animals held
sacred in Egypt, there is an account prevailing among them of the following
kind:</p>
<p><A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'Some say that the original race
of gods, being few and overpowered by the multitude and impiety of the
earth-born men, made themselves like certain irrational animals, and so escaped:
and afterwards, by way of rendering thanks for their safety, they consecrated
the natures of the very animals whose likeness they had taken.</p>
<p>'But others say that in their encounters with their enemies their leaders
prepared images of the animals which they now honour, and wore these upon the
head, and had this as a mark of their authority: and when they were victorious
over their foes, they ascribed the cause to the animals whose images they wore,
and deified them.</p>
<p><A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'Others allege a third cause,
saying that the animals have been so honoured because of their usefulness. For
the cow bears calves, and ploughs, and sheep bear lambs and supply clothing and
food by their milk and cheese, and the dog helps men in hunting, and keeps
guard; and for these reasons the god whom they call Anubis has, they say, a
dog's head, meaning that he was a bodyguard of Osiris and Isis.</p>
<p>'But some say that when Isis was searching for Osiris the dogs led the way
before her, and drove off the wild beasts, and the men who encountered them.</p>
<p>'The cat too, they say, is useful against asps and the other venomous
reptiles: the ichneumon breaks the crocodiles' eggs, and even destroys the
crocodiles, by rolling itself in the mud, and leaping into their mouths when
open, and, by eating away their entrails, leaves them quite dead.</p>
<p>'Of the birds the ibis, they say, is useful against snakes and locusts and
caterpillars and the hawk against scorpions and horned serpents, and the smaller
venomous beasts, and because of its helping in divinations: the eagle also,
because it is a kingly bird.</p>
<p><A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'The he-goat, they say, has been
deified, like Priapus among the Greeks, because of its generative organ, for
this animal has the strongest propensity to lust; and that member of the body
which is the cause of generation is rightly honoured, as being the source of
animal nature. And speaking generally, not only the Egyptians, but also not a
few other nations have consecrated that member in their initiatory rites, as the
cause of the reproduction of living beings.</p>
<p>'The priests who succeed to the hereditary priesthoods in Egypt are initiated
in the mysteries of this deity: the Pans also and the Satyrs, they say, are
honoured among men for the same reason; and therefore most persons dedicate
images of them in the temples very similar to a he-goat; for this animal is
traditionally said to be extremely lustful.</p>
<p>'The sacred bulls Apis and Mnevis are held in like honour as the gods, both
on account of their help in agriculture, and because men ascribe the discovery
of the fruits of the earth to them.</p>
<p>'Wolves are worshipped because of the likeness of their nature to dogs, and
because in old times when Isis, with her son Horus, was going to fight against
Typhon, Osiris, they say, came from Hades to the aid of his wife and child in
the likeness of a wolf.</p>
<p>'But others say that the Ethiopians, having invaded Egypt, were driven away
by a multitude of wolves; and on this account the city is called Lycopolis. <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>The crocodile.is said to be worshipped because the robbers from Arabia and
Libya are afraid to swim across the Nile on account of the crocodiles,</p>
<p>'They say too that one of their kings, being pursued by his own hounds, took
refuge in the marsh, and then was taken up by a crocodile and, strange to say,
carried over to the other side.</p>
<p>'Other causes also are alleged by some for the worship of the irrational
animals. For when in old time the multitude revolted from the kings, and agreed
that they would no longer have kings to rule over them, some one formed the idea
of supplying them with different animals as objects of worship, so that while
they severally worshipped that which was honoured among themselves, and despised
that which was held sacred among others, the Egyptians might never be able all
to agree together. <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A><sup> </sup>When any of the
animals mentioned dies, they wrap it in fine linen, and beat their breasts in
lamentation, and bury it in the sacred sepulchres. And whosoever destroys any of
these animals wilfully, incurs death, except if he kill a cat or the ibis; for
if any one kills these, whether wilfully or not, he incurs death in any case.</p>
<p><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'Moreover, if a dog is found dead
in a house, they all shave their whole body and make a mourning; and if wine, or
corn, or any other of the necessaries of life happen to be stored in the house,
they could not bear to use it any more.</p>
<p>'Apis they maintain at Memphis, and Mnevis in Heliopolis, and the he-goat at
Mendes, and the crocodile in the lake Moeris, and the other beasts in sacred
enclosures, offering them wheat-flour, or groats boiled in milk, and various
kinds of cakes mixed with honey, and the ilesh of a goose, either boiled or
roasted.</p>
<p>'But to the carnivorous animals they throw many kinds of birds, and in
company with each male animal they keep the most beautiful females, whom they
call concubines.</p>
<p><A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'When Apis dies and has been
magnificently buried, they seek another like him ; and when he is found, the
people are released from their mourning, and he is brought first to Nilopolis.
And at that time only the calf is seen by women, who stand before him and expose
themselves; but at all other times they are forbidden to come in sight of this
deity. For after the death of Osiris they say that his soul passed into Apis.'</p>
<p>Such is the unseemly theology, or rather atheism, of the Egyptians, which it
is degrading even to oppose, and from which we naturally revolted with
abhorrence, when we found redemption and deliverance from so great evils in no
other way than solely by the saving doctrine of the gospel, which announced the
recovery of sight to the blind in understanding. Their graver theories and
systems of natural science, we shall examine a little later, after we have
discussed the mythology of the Greeks.</p>
<p>The Egyptian and Phoenician mythologies having become thus mixed and
combined, the superstitious belief of the ancient error has naturally gained the
mastery in most nations. But, as I said, we have yet to speak of the notions of
the Greeks.</p>
<p>Now the character assumed by the solemnities of Egyptian theology is that
which we have already set forth, and that the Greek doctrines are mere fragments
and misunderstandings of the same we have frequently stated already upon the
judgement of the writers quoted: this will, however, be made further manifest
from the Greek theology itself, since, in their own records concerning the gods,
they bring nothing forward from native sources, but fall into the fables of
foreign nations: for they are shown to make use of similar statues and the very
same mysteries, as we may learn from the history of these matters, which the
author before mentioned, who brought the Libraries together into one body,
narrates in the third and fourth books of the treatise before quoted, having
commenced his history from the times of Cadmus. Now, that Cadmus came after
Moses is proved by the exact successions of the chronological writings, as we
shall show in due season. So that Moses is proved to be earlier even than the
gods of Greece, seeing that he is before Cadmus, while the gods are shown to
have come later than the age of Cadmus. Hear, however, the historian's own
words: <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A></p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>[DIODORUS] 'Cadmus, the son of Agenor, is said to have been sent from Phoenicia by the
king to search for Europa. who had been carried off by Zeus: when he failed to
find her, he came into Boeotia and founded the Thebes of that country; and
having married Harmonia the daughter of Aphrodite, begat of her Semele and her
sisters.</p>
<p>'And Zeus, after union with Semele, was entreated to make his intercourse
with her like that with Hera. But when he came to her in godlike fashion with
thunderings and lightnings, Semele was unable to bear it, and being pregnant,
miscarried with the child, and herself perished from the fire. But Zeus took the
child and delivered him to Hermes, and sent him away to the cave in Nysa, lying
between Phoenicia and the Nile: and being thus reared by the Nymphs, Dionysus
became the discoverer of wine, and taught men the culture of the vine.</p>
<p>'He discovered also the drink prepared from barley, which is called zyilius.
He used to lead about with him an army not only of men, but also of women, and
punished the impious and unjust.</p>
<p><A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'He went on an expedition also
into India for three years: and from that circumstance the Greeks established
triennial sacrifices to Dionysus, and think that the god makes his appearances
among men at that time: and all men worship him for his gift of wine, just as
they worship Demeter for the discovery of corn as food.</p>
<p><A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'But there is said to be also
another Dionysus, much earlier in time than this one, whom some call Sabazius, a
son of Zeus and Persephone, whose birth, and sacrifices, and ceremonies they
represent at night, and in secret, because of the shame attendant upon their
intercourse. He was the first who attempted to yoke oxen, and from this they
represent him with horns. But Dionysus, the son of Semele, who is of later date,
was delicate in body, and eminently beautiful, and very prone to amorous
pleasures; in his expeditions he led about a multitude of women armed with
spears made into thyrsi.</p>
<p>'They say also that he is accompanied in his travels by the Muses, who are
virgins and extremely well trained, and charm the soul of the god by singing and
dancing. Silenus too, as his tutor, contributes much to his progress in virtue.
As a remedy against the headaches resulting from too much wine, his head is
bound up with a band.</p>
<p>'And they call him Dimetor, because the two Dionysi were of one father, but
two mothers. They also set a reed in his hand, because the men of old drank
unmixed wine and became maddened, and beat each other with their staves, so that
some were even killed, and from this cause they introduced the custom of using
reeds instead of clubs.</p>
<p><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A><sup> </sup>'He is called Bacchius from the
Bacchae, and Lenaeus from the treading of the grapes in wine-presses, and
Bromius from the roar of thunder which took place at his birth.</p>
<p>'They also say that he leads about Satyrs with him, who afford him pleasure
and delight in their dances and their goat-songs; and that he established
dramatic spectacles and a system of musical recitations. Such are the statements
concerning Dionysus.</p>
<p><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> 'Priapus is said to be the son of Dionysus
and Aphrodite, because men filled with wine are naturally excited to amorous
pleasures. But some say that the ancients gave to the human organ of generation
the mythological name Priapus.</p>
<p>'Others affirm that, because the genital member is the cause of the
generation of mankind, therefore it had for ever received immortal honour: as
indeed the Egyptians also said that Isis, in her search for the members of
Osiris, when she could not find the male organ, appointed it to be worshipped as
a god, and set it up in the temple.</p>
<p>'Nay, even among the Greeks, not only in the Dionysiac rites, but also in all
others, this god receives a certain honour, being brought in with laughter and
jesting in their sacrifices: as is also Hermaphroditus, who got his name as
being begotten of Hermes and Aphrodite.</p>
<p>'This god, they say, appears at certain times among men, and is born with the
bodily form of man and woman combined: but some say that such things are
prodigies, and, being produced but rarely, are significant sometimes of evil and
sometimes of good.</p>
<p><A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> 'The Muses are daughters of Zeus and
Mnemosyne, but some say of Uranus and G&eacute;. Most mythologists also make them
virgins, and say that they got their name from initiating men, that is teaching
them the liberal arts.</p>
<p>Now with respect to Heracles the Greeks tell such, stories as follow:</p>
<p><A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> 'Of Zeus and Danae the daughter of Acrisius
was born Perseus, and of Perseus and Andromeda Electryon, and of him Alcmena, by
his union with whom Zeus begat Heracles, making the night which he passed with
her thrice as long as usual: and this was the only intercourse sought by Zeus,
not on account of amorous desire, as in the case with the other women, but
chiefly for the sake of begetting a son.</p>
<p>'But Hera being jealous delayed Alcmena's labour, and brought Eurystheus into
the world before the proper time, because Zeus had proclaimed that the child
which should be born that day was to reign over the Persidae.</p>
<p>'And when Alcmena was delivered, she exposed the child, as it is said,
through fear of Hera: but Athena admired the child, and persuaded Hera to give
it the breast: and when the boy dragged at her breast with a violence beyond his
age, Hera in great pain threw the child down, and Athena took it up and
persuaded the mother to nurse it.</p>
<p><A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> 'After this Hera sent two serpents to destroy
the child, but the boy, undismayed, strangled the serpents by squeezing their
necks in either hand. When Heracles was grown to be a man, Eurystheus, who had
the kingdom of Argolis, ordered him to perform twelve labours.</p>

Hera sent a frenzy upon him, and through vexation of soul he became mad. As the
disease increased, being out of his mind, he attempted to kill his companion and
nephew lolaus, and when he escaped, slew his own sons begotten of Megara,
daughter of King Creon, by shooting them down with arrows as if they were
enemies.</p>

Eurystheus in the twelve labours. He also slew the Centaurs, and among them
Cheiron, who was renowned for his skill in healing.</p>

coincidence in the birth of this god Heracles. For the first mortal woman
visited by Zeus was Niobe, daughter of Phoroneus, and the last was Alcmena,
mother of Heracles, whom they trace as descended from Niobe in the sixteenth
generation. And with her Zeus ended his intercourse with mortal women.</p>
<p><A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> However, after finishing his labours,
Heracles gave his own wife Megara to live with his nephew Iolaus, because of the
calamity about his children; and for himself asked Iole, the daughter of
Eurytus, in marriage, and, on her father's refusal, he fell sick, and received
an oracle that he would be delivered from his sickness, if he first became sold
into slavery.</p>
<p>'So he sails to Phrygia and is bought by one of his friends, and becomes a
slave of Omphale, queen of those who were at that time called Maeonians, but now
Lydians: and during the time of his slavery he has a son Cleolaus born to him of
a slave. And, having married Omphale, he gets sons by her also.</p>
<p><A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> 'But as he was on his way back to Arcadia,
and stayed as guest with King Leos, he secretly seduced his daughter, and left
her with child, and came back.</p>

daughter of Oeneus, Meleager being now dead. <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>And having taken captive the daughter of Phyleus, by intercourse with her
he begat Tlepolemus. While he was supping with Oeneus, the servant made a
mistake about something, and Heracles struck him with his fist and killed him.</p>
<p>'When on his journey he came to the river Evenus, he found the Centaur Nessus
ferrying people across the river for hire. He ferried Deianeira over first, and,
being enamoured of her for her beauty, tried to do violence to her; but when she
cried out to her husband, Heracles shot the Centaur; and Nessus in the midst of
his embrace, being at the point of death through the sharpness of the wound,
told Deianeira that he would give her a philtre, so that Heracles might never
wish to wed any other woman.</p>
<p>'He bade her therefore take of the blood which was dropping from the point of
the arrow, and, after mixing it with oil, anoint therewith the tunic of
Heracles: and this Deianeira did, and kept the philtre by her.</p>

Erechtheus, having begotten fifty daughters by different wives, and being
ambitious that they should get children by Heracles, entertained him at a

all in one night, and became the father of the so-called Thespiadae.</p>

perform a sacrifice, he sent to his wife Deianeira and asked for the cloak and
tunic which he was accustomed to wear for sacrifices: and she anointed the tunic
with the philtre which the Centaur had given her, and sent it.</p>
<p>'And Heracles had no sooner put on the tunic than he fell into the greatest
misery. For the arrow had been poisoned with the blood of the hydra, and so the
tunic began to prey upon the flesh of his body because of its burning heat, so
that in his extremity of pain he slew the messenger who had brought it, and, in
accordance with an oracle, cast himself into the fire, and so ended his life.

he was the son of Apollo and Coronis, and studied zealously the science of
healing, and rose to such a height of fame, that many of the sick who were given

enraged, and smote him with a thunderbolt and killed him; and Apollo, being
enraged because of the death of his son, slew the Cyclopes who had forged the
thunderbolt for Zeus: but Zeus was enraged at their death, and commanded Apollo
to serve as a slave with Adrnetus, and took this revenge upon him for his
crimes.'</p>
<p>This, then, is what Diodorus has set forth in the fourth book of his <i>Bibliothecae</i>.
And as to the rest of their theology, the same author again asserts that the
Greeks borrowed it from the other nations, for in the third book of the same
history he writes as follows:----</p>
<p><A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> 'Now the people of Atlas say that their first
king was Uranus, and of him were born by many wives five and forty sons, of whom
eighteen were by a wife Titaea; and she, having been a virtuous woman and the
author of many good deeds, was deified after her death, and had her name changed
to Ge.</p>
<p>'Uranus also had daughters, Basileia, and Rhea who was also called Pandora.
And because Basileia brought up her brothers with maternal affection, she was
called Meter.</p>
<p>'And afterwards, when Uranus was dead, she lived with her brother Ilyperion,
and bore two sons, whom she named Helios and Selene.</p>
<p>'But the brethren of Rhea were afraid of them, and slew Ilyperion, and
drowned Helios in the river Eridanus. Selene, on learning this, threw herself
down from a roof, and Meter became mad and wandered about the country, with her
hair loose, driven frantic by drums and cymbals, until she too disappeared
altogether.</p>
<p>'And the multitude, astonished at the catastrophe, transferred Helios and
Selene to the stars of heaven, and regarded their mother as a goddess, and set
up altars, and worshipped her with performances by drums and cymbals.</p>
<p><A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> 'The Phrygians say that Maeon was king of
Phrygia and begat a daughter named Cybele, who first invented a pipe, and was
called the Mountain Mother. And Marsyas the Phrygian, who was friendly with her,
was the first to join flutes together, and he lived in chastity to the end of
his life.</p>
<p>'But Cybele became pregnant by intercourse with Attis, and when this was
known, her father killed Attis and the nurses: and Cybele became mad and rushed
out into the country, and there continued howling and beating a drum.</p>
<p>'She was accompanied by Marsyas, who entered into a musical contest with
Apollo, and was defeated, and flayed alive by Apollo.</p>
<p>'And Apollo became enamoured of Cybele and accompanied her in her wanderings
as far as the Hyperboreans, and ordered the body of Attis to be buried, and
Cybele to be honoured as a goddess.</p>
<p>'Wherefore the Phrygians keep this custom even to the present day, lamenting
the death of the youth, and erecting altars, and honouring Attis and Cybele with
sacrifices.</p>
<p>'And afterwards, at Pessinus in Phrygia, they built a costly temple, and
instituted most magnificent worship and sacrificial rites.</p>
<p><A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> 'After the death of Hyperion the sons of
Uranus divided the kingdom among themselves, the most illustrious of them being
Atlas and Kronos. And of these Atlas took the regions along the coasts of the
ocean, and became an excellent astronomer: and d he had seven daughters who were
called the Atlantides, and these, by union with the comeliest gods, became the
founders of the most numerous race, and gave birth to such as for their worth
became gods and heroes; thus the eldest of them, Maia, by union with Zeus became
mother of Hermes.</p>
<p><A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A> 'But Kronos, surpassing all in arrogance and
impiety, married his sister Rhea, and of her begat Zeus. There had been also
another Zeus, the brother of Uranus and king of Crete, far inferior in fame to
him of later birth.</p>
<p>'This latter then became, king of the whole world; but the other became king
of Crete, and begat ten sons who were called Curetes: and his sepulchre, they
say, is still shown in Crete.</p>
<p>'Now Kronos reigned in Sicily and Libya and Italy: but his son Zeus desired a
life the opposite to his father's. And some say that he succeeded to the kingdom
by his father's voluntary retirement, others that he was chosen by the multitude
because of their hatred to his father.</p>
<p>'So when Kronos with the Titans made war against him, Zeus was victorious in
battle, and marched over the whole inhabited world. He excelled in bodily
strength and all virtues, and showed b the greatest zeal in punishment of the
impious and benefits to the good; in return for which, after his departure from
among men, he was called Zeus, because he was thought to liave been the author
of the noble life (&#950;&#951;&#957;) for mankind.</p>
<p>'These then are the principal heads of the theology held among the
Atlanteans.'</p>
<p>These the Greeks also are said to borrow. So Diodorus writes in the third
volume of his histories: and in the sixth, the same author confirms the same
theology from the writings of Euemerus the Messenian, speaking word for word as
follows: <A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'With regard then to gods the men of old have handed down to their posterity
two sets of notions. For some, say they, are eternal and imperishable, as the
Sun and Moon and the other heavenly bodies, and besides these the winds, and the
rest who partake of the like nature with them; for each of these has an eternal
origin and eternal continuance. Other deities they say were of the earth; but,
because of the benefits which they conferred on mankind, they have received
immortal honour and glory, as Heracles, Dionysus, Aristaeus, and the others like
them.</p>
<p>'Concerning the terrestrial gods many various tales have been handed down in
the historical and mythological writers. Among the historians Euemerus, the
author of the <i>Sacred Record</i>, has written a special history; and of the
mythologists Homer, Hesiod, Orpheus, and such others as these, have invented
very marvellous myths concerning the gods: and we shall endeavour to run over
what both classes have recorded concisely and with a view to due proportion.</p>
<p>'Euemerus, then, was a friend of King Cassander and, having boon constrained
for his sake to perform some important services for the king, and some long
journeys, says that he was carried away southwards into the ocean; for, having
started on his voyage from Arabia Felix, he sailed many days across the ocean,
and landed on some oceanic islands, one of which is that called Panchaea, in
which he saw the Panchaean inhabitants, who were eminent in piety, and honoured
the gods with most magnificent sacrifices and notable offerings of silver and
gold.</p>
<p>'The island also was sacred to the gods ; and there were many other things to
be admired both for their antiquity, and for the ingenuity of their manufacture,
the particulars concerning which we have recorded in the books preceding this.</p>
<p>'Also therein on a certain exceedingly high hill is a temple of Zeus
Triphylius, erected by himself at the time when he reigned over the whole
inhabited world, being still among men. In this temple there is a golden pillar,
on which is inscribed in the Panchaean language a summary of the acts of Uranus,
Kronos, and Zeus.</p>
<p>'After this he says that Uranus was the first king, a gentle and benevolent
man, and learned in the motion of the stars, who also was the first to honour
the celestial deities with sacrifices, on which account he was called Uranus.</p>
<p>'By his wife Ilestia he had sons Pan and Kronos, and daughters Rhea and
Demeter: and after Uranus, Kronos became king and, having married Rhea, begat
Zeus and Hera and Poseidon.' And Zeus, having succeeded to the kingdom of
Kronos, married Hera and Demeter and Themis, of whom he begat children, of the
first the Curetes, of the second Persephone, and of the third Athena.</p>
<p>'And when he had come to Babylon he was entertained as a guest by Belus: and
afterwards on arriving at the island Panchaea, which lay by the ocean, he built
an altar to his own grandfather Uranus: and thence he came through Syria to the
sovereign of that time Casius, of whom mount Casius is named; and came into
Cilicia and conquered in war Cilix the ruler of the country; and visited very
many other nations and was honoured among all, and was proclaimed a god.'</p>
<p>After narrating these and similar tales concerning the gods as if they were
mortal men, he further says : <A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A></p>
<p>'With regard to Euemerus who composed the <i>Sacred Record</i>, we will be
satisfied with what has been said ; but the legends of the Greeks concerning the
gods we will try to run over briefly, following Hesiod and Homer and Orpheus.'</p>
<p>Then he appends in order the mythologies of the poets. Let it suffice us,
however, to have made these extracts from the theology of the Greeks, to which
it is reasonable to append an account of the initiatory rites in the inner
shrines of the same deities, and of their secret mysteries, and to observe
whether they bear any becoming mark of a theology that is truly divine, or arise
from regions below out of long daemoniacal delusion, and are deserving of
ridicule, or rather of shame, and yet more of pity for those who are still
blinded. These matters are unveiled in plain terms by the admirable Clement, in
his <i>Exhortation to the Greeks</i>, a man who had gone through experience of
all, but had quickly emerged from the delusion as one who had been rescued from
evil by the word of salvation and through the teaching of the Gospel. Listen,
then, to a brief statement of these matters also.<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A></p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>[CLEMENT] 'Explore not then too curiously the secret shrines of impiety, nor the mouths
of caverns full of prodigies, or the Thesprotian cauldron, or the Cirrhaean
tripod, or the brazen urn of Dodona: leave also to antiquated fables the old
stump held sacred amid desert sands, and the oracle there, now decayed with the
oak itself. The fountain certainly of Castalia is silently forgotten, and
another fountain of Colophon; the other oracular streams also are in like manner
dead. And so, though emptied late of their vain glory, they have nevertheless
been clearly proved to have run dry together with their own fabulous stories.</p>
<p>'Describe to us also the useless oracles of the other kinds of divination, or
of frenzy rather, the Clarian, Pythian, Didymean Apollo, Amphiaraus, and
Amphiiochus. Join also with them, if you will, observers of prodigies, and
augurs, and the unholy interpreters of dreams: and bring and set together beside
the Pythian god those that divine by wheat-flour, and by barley, and the
ventriloquists still held in honour among the multitude. Yea more, let the
shrines of the Egyptians and the necromancies of the Tyrrhenians be consigned to
darkness. These are in very truth mad sophistry-schools of unbelieving men, and
gambling houses of pure fraud. Partners in this jugglery are the goats that have
been trained for divination, and crows taught by men to utter oracles to men.</p>
<p>'And what if I were to give you a catalogue of the mysteries? I shall not
dance them out, as they say Alcibiades did, but according to the word of truth I
will thoroughly lay bare the jugglery that is concealed in them, and those
so-called gods of yours, to whom the mystic rites belong, I shall wheel in as it
were upon the stage of life before the spectators of truth.</p>
<p>'The Bacchanals celebrate in their orgies the frenzy of Dionysus, keeping
their monthly holiday with a feast on raw flesh, and, in performing the
distribution of the flesh of the slaughtered victims, are crowned with their
wreaths of serpents, and shout upon Eva, that Eva, through whom the deception
crept in [and death followed in its train]: a consecrated serpent, too, is the
symbol of the Bacchic orgies.</p>
<p>'Therefore, according to the exact pronunciation of the Hebrews, the name
Heva, with an aspirate, is at once interpreted as the female serpent. Deo too
and Kore have already become a mystic drama, and Eleusis celebrates by
torchlight the wandering, and the rape, and their mourning.</p>
<p>'I think, too, that we ought to trace the etymology of &quot;orgies&quot; and
&quot;mysteries,&quot; the one from the anger (&#959;&#961;&#947;&#951;&#962;)
of Deo aroused against Zeus, and the other from the pollution (&#956;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#962;)
which had occurred with regard to Dionysus. Or even if you derive it from a
certain Myus of Attica, who perished in hunting, as Apollodorus says, I do not
grudge that your mysteries have been glorified by the honour of a name which is
engraved upon a tomb.</p>
<p>'In another way also you may think of your mysteries as mytheria
(hunting-stories) by the correspondence of letters. For fables such as these do
most especially make prey of the most barbarous of the Thracians, the most
senseless of the Phrygians, the most superstitious of the Greeks.</p>
<p>'Ill betide him then who first taught men this imposture, whether he were
Dardanus, who instituted the mysteries of the Mother of the gods, or one Eetion,
who established the orgies and initiations of the Samothracians, or that famous
Phrygian Midas, who learned the cunning imposture from Odrysus and then spread
it among his subjects.</p>
<p>'For never will I be cajoled by that Cyprian islander Cinyras, who dared to
transfer the lewd orgies of Aphrodite from night to day, in his desire to deify
a harlot of his own country.</p>
<p>'But others say that Melampus son of Amythaon brought over from Egypt to
Hellas the festivals of Deo, her grief so famed in song. These for my part I
should call evil authors of impious fables, and parents of deadly superstition,
as having in the mysteries implanted a seed of wickedness and corruption in
man's life.</p>
<p>'And now, for it is time, I will prove that your orgies themselves are full
of imposture and quackery: and if you have been initiated, you will laugh all
the more at these your venerated fables. And I shall proclaim the hidden secrets
openly, and not let modesty hinder me from speaking of things which you are not
ashamed to worship.</p>
<p>'First then, the daughter of the foam, the Cyprus-born, the beloved of
Cinyras, Aphrodite I mean,</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          &quot;Enamour'd of the source from which she sprang,&quot; <A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'those mutilated members of Uranus, those lustful members, which after their
excision did violence to the waves, how wanton the members, of which your
Aphrodite becomes the worthy fruit! In the mystic celebration of this pleasure
of the sea a lump of salt and a phallus are delivered as a symbol of generation
to those who are being initiated in the adulterous art: and they pay a piece of
money to her, as lovers to a harlot.</p>
<p>'The mysteries of Deo, and the amorous embraces of Zeus with Demeter his
mother, and the wrath of----I know not what to call her now----his mother or
wife, Demeter, on account of which wrath, they say, she was called Brimo; the
supplications of Zeus, and the drink of gall, the plucking out of the victim's
heart, and unspeakable deeds,----these things the Phrygians celebrate in honour
of Attis, and Cybele, and the Corybantes.</p>
<p>'They have also made up a story that Zeus, having torn off parts of a ram,
brought and threw them into the lap of Deo, paying a fraudulent penalty for his
violence, as though they had been parts of himself.</p>
<p>'The watchwords of this initiation, if set before you merely for amusement,
will, I know, stir your laughter, although you may not be willing to laugh
because of the exposures. &quot;I ate out of the drum, and drank out of the
cymbal, I danced the
&#954;&#949;&#961;&#957;&#959;&#960;&#951;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#945;, I slipped
into the bridal-chamber.&quot; Are not these watchwords an outrage? Are not the
mysteries a farce?</p>
<p>'But what if I should add the rest of the story? Demeter has a child, and her
daughter grows up, and again this Zeus who begat her seduces his own daughter
Pherephatta, after her mother Deo, forgetting his former crime, and he
approaches her in the form of a serpent, it being thus proved who he was.</p>
<p>'Accordingly, in the Sabazian mysteries the sign for those who are initiated
is &quot;The god gliding over the breast&quot;; and this is a serpent drawn over
the breast of those who are initiated, a proof of the incontinence of Zeus.
Pherephatta also gives birth to a son in the form of a bull.</p>
<p>'At all events, a certain sham, poet says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          &quot;Bull begets serpent, serpent begets bull.<br>
          Upon the mount the herdsman's secret goad.&quot; <A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>calling, I suppose, the reed which the Bacchanals brandish a herdsman's goad.</p>
<p>'Would you have me narrate to you also Pherephatta's gathering of flowers,
and her basket, and her seizure by Aidoneus, and the chasm opening in the earth,
and the swine of Eubuleus that were swallowed up with the two goddesses, on
account of which in the Thesmophoria they throw down swine, when they visit the
caves.</p>
<p>'This fable the women in every city celebrate with festivals in d various
ways, the Thesmophoria, Scirophoria, Arretophoria, dramatizing the rape of
Pherephatta in many ways.</p>
<p>'As to the mysteries of Dionysus, they are perfectly inhuman: for when he was
yet a child, with the Curetes circling round him in a war-dance, and the Titans
had treacherously crept in, they beguiled him with childish toys, did these
Titans, and tore him in pieces while yet an infant, as the poet of this mystery,
Orpheus the Thracian, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          &quot;Cone, humming top, and dolls that bend their limbs,<br>
          Fair golden apples from the guardian Nymphs.<br>
          Of sweetest song, daughters of Hesperus.&quot; <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Nor will it be useless to set forth for condemnation the useless symbols of
this mystery: dice, ball, hoop, apples, humming-top, mirror, and lock of wool.</p>
<p>'So then Athena, having stolen away the heart of Dionysus, was called Pallas
from the pulsation of the heart: and the Titans, who had torn him in pieces, put
a cauldron on a trivet, and threw in the limbs of Dionysus, and, having first
boiled them down,</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          &quot;Then pierc'd with spits and held them o'er the fire.&quot; <A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'But afterwards Zeus suddenly appears----I suppose, if he was a god, he
perceived the savour of the roasting flesh, for your gods acknowledge that
savour to be their perquisite,----and with a thunderbolt he smites the Titans,
and delivers the limbs of Dionysus to his son Apollo to bury: and he did not
disobey Zeus, but bore the dead body, mangled as it was, to Parnassus and there
deposited it.</p>
<p>'If you wish to be initiated in the orgies of the Corybantes also, two of
them slew the third brother, and wrapped up the head of the corpse in a purple
cloth, and put a wreath upon it, and carried him on a brazen shield, and buried
him under the side of Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>'These are their mysteries, murders in short, and burials! And their priests,
whom those concerned call &quot;Lords of the Mysteries,&quot; invent more
wonders to add to the tragedy, forbidding to set a whole root of parsley on the
table, because they think forsooth that parsley has sprung from the blood which
streamed forth from the Corybant; just as the women who celebrate the
Thesmophoria guard against eating the seeds of the pomegranate, for the drops
which fell on the ground from the blood of Dionysus they suppose to have grown
into pomegranates.</p>
<p>'As they call the Corybantes Cabeiri, they also proclaim the festival as the
Cabeiria. For these very two fratricides, having carried off the chest in which
the member of Dionysus was deposited, brought it by sea to Tyrrhenia, as
purveyors of a noble cargo! And here they lived in exile, and imparted to the
Tyrrhenians their highly venerable doctrine of religion, the chest and its
contents, for them to worship; for which cause some not unreasonably will have
it that Dionysus is called Attis, as having been mutilated.</p>
<p>'And what wonder if Tyrrhenians, who were barbarians, are initiated in such
foul passions, when there is found among the Athenians, and in the rest of
Hellas----I blush even to say it----the shameful legend of Deo.</p>
<p>'For Deo, wandering in search of her daughter Kore in the neighbourhood of
Eleusis----this place is in Attica----grows weary, and sits down in sorrow upon
a well. This is forbidden to those who are admitted to the mysteries even to the
present day, lest the initiated should seem to be imitating the goddess in her
mourning.</p>
<p>'Now at that time Eleusis was inhabited by the Earth-born: their names were
Baubo, and Dysaules, and Triptolemus, also Eumolpus and Eubuleus. Triptolemus
was a herdsman, Eumolpus a shepherd, and Eubuleus a swineherd. And from these
last grew the flourishing family of the Eumolpidae, and that of the Heralds, the
Hierophants I suppose, at Athens.</p>
<p>'And then Baubo----for I shall not shrink from telling it----having received
Deo hospitably, offers her a draught. And when she refused to take it, and would
not drink----for she was full of sorrow----Baubo became much annoyed as being
forsooth disdained, and exposed herself to the goddess: and Deo, pleased at the
sight, at last reluctantly accepted the draught, because she was delighted at
what she saw.</p>
<p>'These are the secret mysteries of the Athenians! These are the things which
Orpheus records! But I will set before you the very words of Orpheus, that you
may have the master of mysteries himself as witness of their shamelessness:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          &quot;She spake, and quick her flowing robes withdrawn<br>
          Showed all the secret beauty of her form.<br>
          The child lacchus, laughing, stretched his hand<br>
          To touch her tender breasts, and Baubo smil'd;<br>
          Then, too, the goddess smil'd with cheerful thought,<br>
          And took the shining bowl which held the draught.&quot; <A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>&nbsp;
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'There is also the watchword of the Eleusinian mysteries: <i>I fasted, I
drank the draught, I took from the chest, finished the work and put it back into
the basket, and from the basket into the chest</i>.<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
Noble indeed the sights, and becoming to a goddess!</p>
<p>'Worthy rather are these mysteries of night, and of torch-light, and of the
great-hearted, or rather weak-minded, people of the Erechtheidae, and of the
other Greeks also, &quot;men for whom there remain after death things that they
little look for,&quot;</p>
<p>'To whom then does Heracleitus the Ephesian address this foreboding? &quot;<i>To
night-walkers, sorcerers, bacchanals male and female, to the initiated</i>.&quot;<A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
These he threatens with what follows death; to these he predicts the fire. <i>For
they receive an unholy initiation in what men regard as mysteries.</i><A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>'Custom therefore, and vain opinion, and the mysteries of the serpent are a
kind of fraud devoutly observed by men who, with spurious piety, promote their
abominable initiations and profane orgiastic rites.</p>
<p>'What also are those mystic chests? For I must lay bare their holy things,
and tell out their forbidden secrets. Are they not sesame-cakes, and pyramids,
and balls, and flat cakes full of knobs, and lumps of salt? A serpent also,
mystic symbol of Dionysus Bassarus?</p>
<p>'And besides these are there not pomegranates, and shoots of fig-trees, and
reeds, and ivies, and round cakes also, and poppies?</p>
<p>'These are their holy things! And there are in addition the secret symbols of
Themis, wild marjoram, a lamp, a sword, a woman's comb, which is an euphemistic
and mystical name.</p>
<p>'O barefaced shamelessness! In times of old for modest men pleasure was
veiled in night, and night in silence: but now the night that is sacred to
wantonness is the talk of those who are to be initiated, and the fire exposes
their lewd passions by the light of torches.</p>
<p>'Quench thou the fire, O Hierophant! Blush for thy lights, O bearer of the
torch! That flame exposes thine lacchus. Suffer the night to conceal the
mysteries: let darkness pay respect to your dignified orgies. The fire is no
hypocrite : its duty is to expose and to punish.</p>
<p>'These are the atheists' mysteries. And atheists I rightly call them, since
they have not known Him who is truly God, but worship a child torn in pieces by
Titans, and a poor wailing woman; and things for very shame unmentionable they
shamelessly worship, and so are involved in a twofold atheism: the first, in
that they are ignorant of God, not acknowledging Him who is God indeed; and the
other and second delusion this, that they regard those which are not as though
they were, and call them gods who have no true being, or rather no being at all,
but have only received the name.'</p>
<p>So far this author.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>With good reason then do we avow that we have been freed from all this, and
rescued from the long and antiquated delusion as from some terrible and most
grievous disease. First, we have been delivered by the grace and beneficence of
Almighty God, and secondly by the ineffable power of our Saviour's teaching in
the Gospel, and thirdly by sound reasoning, because we judged that it is an
unholy and impious thing to honour with the adorable name of God mortals who
have long been lying among the dead, and have not even left a memory of
themselves as virtuous men, but have handed down examples of extreme
incontinence and wantonness, of cruelty also and insanity, for those who come
after them to follow.</p>
<p>For must it not be the extreme of folly for lovers of temperance to yield the
first place to the base and licentious, and for the wise and sensible to render
august worship to those who have lost their senses, and those who practise
justice and benevolence to those who, through excess of cruelty and inhumanity,
are involved in the pollutions of infanticide and parricide?</p>
<p>And does it not surpass every excess of impiety to degrade the adorable and
all-holy name of God to parts of the human body, male and female, which we may
not speak of, and to the irrational nature of brute beasts; and to honour as
divine such foul and inhuman deeds as, even in the case of human malefactors
would, if proved, fall under the inexorable penalties of the laws? But why need
we spend time in proclaiming to every man, barbarian and Greek alike, his
deliverance from the evils described, and in bringing to light the
reasonableness of our revolt from gods falsely so called, when already the
greater number even of the most superstitious, having woke up as it were from a
deep slumber, and cleared the eye of the soul of its ancient film, became
conscious of the deep folly of the error of their fathers, and took their stand
upon reasoning, and withdrew from the old path, and chose the other way?</p>
<p>Some of these made a bold assault, and with broad derision poured contempt
upon the whole mythology of their own forefathers; while others, who shrank from
the dogma of atheism, neither stood upon their old ways, nor withdrew from them
altogether, but, with the purpose of glossing over and explaining their own
dogma, gave to the true histories of the gods who had been celebrated among them
the title of fables invented by poets, and said that physical theories were
concealed in them. And however much they fail to bring any proof whatever of the
truth of these theories, it will nevertheless be necessary for us to set forth
for examination their solemn doctrines, that thus we may prove the
reasonableness of that retreat from them which was provided for us solely by the
teaching of our Saviour in the Gospel. Come then, let us take up their argument
from the beginning and examine it.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>Now by the Greek theology I mean the popular and more mythical theology,
which also prevailed much earlier among the Phoenicians and Egyptians and the
other nations of whom mention was made in our preceding books; and the character
of this has been proved to be something of the kind which has been already made
manifest by the words quoted from the Greek historians themselves. And this
character we have with good reason set before our readers in the beginning of
this our <i>Preparation for the Gospel</i> for their judgement and decision,
that both we and those who as yet have no experience of this subject, may learn
for ourselves what we were long ago, and from what sort of forefathers we have
sprung, by how great evils we were previously fettered, and in how great a
stupor of impiety and ignorance of God our souls were buried, and then were
favoured with an uprising and deliverance from all these evils at once by the
sole teaching of the Gospel, provided for us in no other way than by the
manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who is God.</p>
<p>For not in a mere part of the earth, nor in a corner of the land of one
nation, but throughout the whole inhabited world, where the power of the most
superstitious delusion especially prevailed, He, like a sun of intelligent and
rational souls, spread abroad the beams of His own light: He translated us all,
of every race of mankind, barbarians and Greeks alike, as it were from a
terrible darkness and most gloomy and obscure night of superstitious error into
the bright and shining day of the true worship of God the King of all.</p>
<p>Certainly the statements that have been already quoted have plainly taught
us, that those who in cities and villages have been excited about this delusion
of many gods were all universally serving and worshipping images of the dead,
and statues of men who have long since passed away. For the men of old, because
of the extreme savageness of their life at that time made no account of God the
Creator of all, nor paid any heed to the divine judgement which takes vengeance
on wrong doing, but cast themselves headlong into every kind of profanity.</p>
<p>For at that time there were no laws yet established for the guidance of life,
no civilized government set in order among men, but they led a loose and
wandering life like that of the beasts: and some of them, like irrational
animals, cared for nothing beyond the filling of their belly, and among these
the first kind of atheism found a home; but others, being in some small degree
stirred by natural instincts, conceived that God, and God's power, was some good
and salutary thing, and because they wished to find Him, they raised their souls
aloft to heaven, and there stopping short in thought, and being astonished at
the various beauties of the luminaries which gave and received light in heaven,
declared that these were gods.</p>
<p>But a third and different class cast themselves down upon earth, and seeing
those who had been thought to excel their contemporaries in wisdom, or had
become masters of the multitude by strength of body and power of government,
such as giants or tyrants, or even sorcerers and quacks, who after some falling
off from holier ways had devised their evil arts of sorcery, or others who had
been the authors of some common benefit to human life,----to these, both while
yet living and after death, they gave the title of gods. And from this cause the
houses of their gods are mentioned as being tombs of the dead, as Clement
relates in his <i>Exhortation to the Greeks</i>, bringing forward Greeks
themselves as witnesses of his statement. Listen then again, if it please you,
to what he writes in the following style:<A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A></p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>[CLEMENT] 'Naturally therefore superstition, having somewhere found a beginning, has
become a fountain of senseless wickedness; and afterwards, as it was not
checked, but gained increase and rushed on in full flood, it has created a
multitude of daemons, sacrificing hecatombs, celebrating public festivals,
setting up statues, and building temples, which indeed----for I will not keep
silence even on this, but will convict them----were called euphemistically
temples, but were in reality tombs, that is to say, tombs which had got the name
of temples. But now, I pray you, forget at length your superstition, and be
ashamed to worship tombs.</p>
<p>'In the temple of Athena at Larissa in the Acropolis is the tomb of Acrisius,
and at Athens in the Acropolis the tomb of Cecrops, as Antiochus says in the
ninth book of his <i>Histories</i>. And what of Erichthonius? Is he not buried
in the temple of Athena Folias? And Ismarus the son of Eumolpus and Daeira, is
he not buried in the precincts of the Eleusinium, which lies under the
Acropolis? And the daughters of Celeus, are they not buried at Eleusis?</p>
<p>'Why should I tell you of the women who came from the Hyperboreans? There are
two called Hyperoche and Laodice, who are buried in the precinct of Artemis at
Delos, which is in the temple of the Delian Apollo.</p>
<p>'Leander says that Cleomachus is buried at Miletus in the Didyrnaeum. Here,
if we follow Zeno of Myndus, it would not be right to pass over the monument of
Leucophryne, who is buried in the temple of Artemis in Magnesia, nor yet the
altar of Apollo in Telmessus, which also, the story says, is the monument of
Telmesseus the soothsayer.</p>
<p>'Ptolemy too, the son of Agesarchus, in his first book concerning Philopator
says that Cinyras and the descendants of Cinyras are buried in Paphos in the
temple of Aphrodite.</p>
<p>'Were I, however, to go over all the tombs which are worshipped by you,
&quot;all time would not suffice for me to tell&quot;; [Homer, <i>Od</i>. xx.
351] while you, if no shame for these audacities steals over you, may wander
round with your faith in the dead, utterly dead yourselves:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Ah! wretched men, what evil doom is this?&quot; <A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A little further on he says: <A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Another new god the Roman Emperor has deified with great solemnity in Egypt,
and almost in Greece; his favourite Antinous, who was extremely beautiful, was
deified by him, as Ganymede was by Zeus.</p>
<p>'For lust, when free from fear, is not easily restrained: and men now
celebrate the sacred nights of Antinous, the shame of which was known to the
lover who shared his vigils.'</p>
<p>He also adds:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'And now the favourite's tomb is the temple and city of Antinous: for just as
temples are held in reverence, so, I suppose, are tombs, pyramids, mausoleums,
and labyrinths----other temples these of the dead, as those before mentioned
were tombs of the gods.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>And again, a little further on: <A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A></p>
<p>'Come then, let us also briefly make the round of your games, and put an end
to these great sepulchral festivals, the Isthmian, Nemean, and Pythian, and
besides these the Olympian. At Pytho the Pythian dragon is worshipped, and the
festival of the serpent is proclaimed as the Pythia. At the Isthmus the sea cast
up a miserable carcass, and the Isthmian games are a lamentation for Melicertes:
at Nemea another child Archemorus is buried, and the boy's funeral games are
called Nemea. Pisa is the tomb in your midst, O Panhellenes, of a Phrygian
charioteer, and the Zeus of Phidias claims as his own the Olympian games, which
are the funeral libations of Pelops.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>So speaks our author.</p>
<p>Now take thou up our argument again from the beginning, and observe the
downfall of superstitious error. By nature and by our self-taught ideas, or
rather ideas taught by God, there is a something noble and salutary that
indicates the name and being of God: for all men had taken this for granted in
their common reasonings, since the Creator of all things had implanted this
conviction by innate ideas in every rational and intelligent soul.</p>
<p>They had not, however, chosen the course which accords with reason. For only
some one or two perchance, or at most a very few others, whose memory is
recorded in the oracles of the Hebrews, could not adapt their idea of God to any
of the things that are seen, but with unperverted reasonings led up their
thoughts from visible things to the Creator of the whole world and the great
Maker of the universe; and with purified eyes of the understanding perceived
that He alone is God, the Saviour of all, and sole giver of good gifts. But the
rest wandered about in all kinds of mental blindness, and were carried into an
abyss of ungodliness, so that like wild beasts they limited the beautiful, and
useful, and good to the pleasure of the eyes and the flesh.</p>
<p>And in this way, as I have said before, the discoverers of the things
supposed to be good and useful to the body, or certain governors, or tyrants, or
even sorcerers and poisoners, though of mortal nature and subjected to the
misfortunes of humanity, were called saviours and gods as givers of good things,
and men transferred, the august conception which was implanted in them by nature
to those whom they supposed to be benefactors.</p>
<p>And accordingly so great a mental paralysis possessed them, that they took no
account of the iniquities of those whom they regarded as gods, nor blushed at
the shameful tales reported of them, but in all these things admired the men
because of the benefits provided by them, or because of the governments and
tyrannies which were then first established.</p>
<p>For example, as I said before, since at that time no laws were yet
administered, nor punishment suspended over evil deeds, they recorded as
rightful and brave deeds, adulteries and sodomy, and incestuous and unlawful
marriages, and bloodshed and parricides, and murders of children and brethren,
and moreover, wars and seditions actually carried on by their own champions,
whom they both accounted and called gods, and bequeathed the remembrance of them
as worshipful and brave to later generations.</p>
<p>Such was the ancient theology which was transformed by certain moderns of
yesterday's growth, who boasted of having a more reasonable philosophy, and
introduced what they called the more physical view of the history of the gods,
by devising more respectable and ingenious explanations for the legends: yet
they neither escaped altogether the fault of their forefathers' impiety, nor, on
the other hand, could endure the self-manifested wickedness of their so-called
gods.</p>
<p>So, in their eagerness to palliate the fault of their fathers, they changed
the legends into physical narratives and theories, and boasted, as the more
mystical view, that the things which give nourishment and increase to the nature
of the body are those which the legends set forth.</p>
<p>Going on from this point, these men also gave the title of gods to the
elements of the world, not just merely to sun and moon and stars, but also to
earth and water, and air and fire, and their combinations and resultants, and
moreover to the seasonable fruits of the earth, and all other produce of food
both dry and liquid: and these very things, regarded as causes of the life of
the body, they called Demeter, and Kore, and Dionysus, and other like names,
and, by making gods of them, introduced a forced and untrue embellishment of
their legends.</p>
<p>But it was in a later age that these men, as if ashamed of the theologies of
their forefathers, added respectable explanations, which each invented of
himself, to the legends concerning their gods; for no one dared to disturb the
customs of their ancestors, but paid great honour to antiquity, and to the
familiar training which had grown with them from their boyhood.</p>
<p>Their elders, however, besides their deifications of men, gave equal rank to
their consecrations of brute animals, because of the benefit derived from them
also for the causes previously assigned; and they devoted equal religious
worship to the brutes, and with libations, sacrifices, mystic rites, and hymns,
and songs, exalted the honours paid to them, in the same manner as to the men
who had been deified. And so they marched on to such a pitch of evil, that,
through excess of unbridled lust, they consecrated with divine honours those
parts of the body that lead to impurity, and the unrestrained passions of
mankind, while their so-called theologians declared that in these things there
is no need at all to use solemn phrases. We must, then, hold it to have been
proved on the highest testimony, that the oldest generations knew nothing more
at all than the history, but adhered to the legends only. Since, however, we
have once begun to glance at the august and recondite doctrines of the noble
philosophers, let us go on and examine these also more fully, that we may not
seem to be ignorant of their wonderful physical theories.</p>
<p>But before we make our exposition of these doctrines, we must first indicate
the mutual contradiction even here of these admirable philosophers themselves.
For some of them make random statements, and set forth their opinions according
to what comes into the mind of each individually: for they do not agree one with
another even in their physical theories. While others more candidly sweep away
the whole system, and banish from their own republic not only the indecent
stories about the gods, but also the interpretations given of them; though
sometimes they speak softly of the legends through fear of the punishment
threatened by the laws.</p>
<p>Listen then to the Greeks themselves speaking by the mouth of the one noblest
of them all, now banishing and now again adopting the legends. Thus their
admirable Plato, when he lays bare his own preference, with great boldness
forbids altogether the thinking or saying such things concerning the gods, as
had been said by them of old, whether they contained anything latent indicated
in allegorical meanings, or were spoken without any allegorical meaning at all.
But at other times he speaks softly of the laws, and says that we ought to
believe the legends about the gods, though there is nothing indicated by them in
allegorical meanings.</p>
<p>But when at last he has dissociated his own theology from the ancient
legends, and has stated his physical theories about the heaven, and sun, and
moon, and stars, and moreover about the whole cosmos, and the parts of it
severally, he again specially and separately goes through the ancient
genealogical accounts of the gods just as follows word for word in the Timaeus.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<p>[PLATO] 'To tell of the other divinities and to learn their origin is beyond our
power; but we must give credence to those who have spoken in former times, who
being, as they said, the offspring of gods had, I suppose, a clear knowledge of
their own ancestors. It is impossible therefore to disbelieve children of the
gods, even though they speak without certain or probable proofs; but as they
assert that they are reporting family histories, we must, in obedience to the
law, believe them.</p>
<p>'On their authority then let the origin of these gods be admitted and stated
by us as follows. The children of Earth and Heaven were Oceanus and Tethys; and
their children Phorcys, and Kronos, and Rhea, and the rest of them: and from
Kronos and Rhea sprang Zeus and Hera, and all whom we know as their reputed
brethren, and still others who were their offspring.' <A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A></p>
<p>These things, says Plato, 'we must in obedience to the law believe,' even
though, he admits, they are stated 'without certain or probable proofs.' And we
must observe how he indicates that the names and genealogies of the so-called
gods have no hidden meaning to be explained by physical theories.</p>
<p>But again, in another place the same author, laying open his own deliberate
opinion, has used these words:<A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A></p>
<p>'In the first place, said I, the author of that greatest lie about the
greatest gods told a bad lie, how Uranus did the deeds which Hesiod says he did,
and how Kronos took revenge upon him.</p>
<p>'Again, even if the doings of Kronos and his treatment by his son were true,
I should not have thought that they ought to be thus lightly told before young
and thoughtless persons, but that they should be buried in silence, as the best
thing; or if there were any necessity to tell them, then as few as possible
should hear them in secret, after sacrificing no mere pig, but some great and
scarce victim, so that very few might have a chance of hearing them.</p>
<p>'Why yes, said he, these stories certainly are mischievous.</p>
<p>'Aye, and they must not be told in our city, Adeimantus; nor must a young
hearer be told that he would be doing nothing remarkable in committing the worst
injuries nor in inflicting every kind of punishment upon his father for injuring
him, but would be doing just what the first and greatest of the gods did.</p>
<p>'Nor do I myself think that such stories are fit to be told.</p>
<p>'Nor yet, said I, about gods going to war with gods and plotting and fighting
(untrue as such things are) ought anything at all to be said, if at least the
future guardians of our city are to regard it as very disgraceful to be lightly
quarrelling one with another. Much less must we invent fables about wars of the
giants, and work them in embroidery, with numberless other quarrels of all kinds
of gods and heroes against their own kith and kin. But if there were any chance
of our persuading them, that no citizen was ever at enmity with a fellow
citizen, and that such a thing was unholy, rather should tales of this kind be
told to children from the first by old men and old women and by those of mature
age, and the poets should be compelled to make their tales like these.</p>
<p>'The chaining, too, of Hera by her son, and the hurling of Hephaestus out of
heaven by his father, when he was going to defend his mother from a beating, and
all the battles of the gods that Homer has invented, must not be admitted into
the city, whether they are composed with or without allegorical meanings.'</p>
<p>By these words, then, the philosopher clearly teaches that both the legends
of the ancients concerning the gods, and the physical explanations of these
legends supposed to be expressed in allegories are to be rejected; so that it
can no longer be denied that there is good reason for our Saviour's teaching in
the Gospel, which bids us to abandon these legends, seeing that they have been
rejected even by their own friends.</p>
<p>Hence it comes that I admire the ancient Romans for the manner in which, when
they perceived that all the physiological theories of the Greeks concerning the
gods were absurd and unprofitable, or rather were forced and inconsistent, they
excluded them, legends and all, from their own theology. This too you may learn
from the <i>Roman Archaeology</i> of Dionysius of Halicarnassus: for he, in his
second book, when relating the history of Romulus, the first founder of the city
of Rome, while recounting his other good deeds, writes on this point especially
in the following manner: <A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A></p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>[DIONYSIUS OF HALICARNASSUS] 'But he knew that good laws and zeal in honourable pursuits render a state
religious and temperate, and observant of justice, and brave in war: and for
these things he took much forethought, beginning with the laws concerning acts
of worship paid to gods and daemons.</p>
<p>'Temples therefore, and precincts, and altars, and the erection of statues,
and their forms and emblems and powers, and gifts whereby they had conferred
benefit on our race, and festivals of all such kinds as ought to be kept in
honour of each god or daemon, and sacrifices wherewith they delight to be
honoured by men, and sacred truces also and national festivals, and seasons of
rest from labour, and all such matters he established in a manner similar to the
best of the customs among the Greeks. But the traditional fables concerning
them, in which there are any slanders or accusations against them, he considered
to be wicked and unprofitable and unseemly, and unworthy not to say of gods but
even of good men, and he excluded them all, and trained men both to speak and
think all that was excellent concerning the gods, imputing to them no practice
unworthy of their blessed nature.</p>
<p>'For among the Romans there is neither any story of Uranus being mutilated by
his own children, nor of Kronos devouring his own offspring through fear of
their attack, nor of Zeus overthrowing the dynasty of Kronos, and shutting up
his own father in the prison of Tartarus; nor yet of wars, and wounds, and
bonds, and servitudes of gods among men.</p>
<p>'Nor is any black-robed or mournful festival held among them, with women's
wailings and lamentations over gods that vanished from sight, such as are
celebrated among the Greeks in reference to the rape of Persephone, and the
sufferings of Dionysus, and all other things of a like kind.</p>
<p>'Nor would any one see among them, even though their customs are now
corrupted, any wild enthusiasms, nor Corybantic frenzies, nor Bacchanalian
revels and secret initiations, no all-night vigils of men and women together in
the temples of the gods, nor any other of the monstrosities akin to these, but
all things concerning the gods practised and spoken of with reverence, such as
is seen neither among Greeks nor barbarians.</p>
<p>'And what I have admired most of all, though countless races have come to
settle in the city, who were strictly bound to worship their ancestral gods with
the rites of their own country, the city has never by public consent sought to
imitate any of the foreign customs, a propensity which has occurred to many
states ere now: but even if any sacred rites have been introduced in accordance
with oracles, the city adapted them to its own institutions, and cast out all
mythical quackery, as for example the rites of the Idaean goddess.</p>
<p>'For in her honour the Consuls celebrate sacrifices and games every year
according to the laws of the Romans: and her priests are a Phrygian man and
Phrygian woman, and these go about the city beggmg for the goddess, as their
custom is, with images fastened round their breasts, and rattling cymbals and
accompanied by their followers playing on flutes the music of the Mother.</p>
<p>'But of the home-born Romans none proceeds through the city either so
begging, or accompanied by flutes and dressed in an embroidered robe, nor
celebrates the goddess with Phrygian orgies by any law or decree of the Senate.</p>
<p>'So cautious is the attitude of the state towards foreign customs concerning
the gods, shunning as ill-omened all vain display in which there is anything
unbecoming.</p>
<p>'But let no one suppose me to be ignorant that some of the Grecian legends
are useful to mankind; some exhibiting the works of nature allegorically, and
others composed for the sake of consoling human misfortunes, and others removing
troubles and terrors of the soul and overthrowing unsound opinions, and others
invented for the sake of some other utility.</p>
<p>'But although I know these things as well as anybody, I am nevertheless
cautiously disposed towards them, and I prefer to accept the theology of the
Romans, considering that the benefits derived from the Hellenic legends are
small, and not capable of benefiting many, but only those who have searched out
the purposes for which they are made. And those who have taken part in this
branch of philosophy are rare; while the great mass unversed in philosophy loves
to take the tales concerning the gods in the worse senses, and is affected in
one of two ways; either it despises the gods as tossed about in great misery, or
else it abstains from none of the most disgraceful and lawless doings, seeing
that they are attributed to the gods.</p>
<p>'On these subjects, however, let inquiry be left to those who study merely
the theoretical part of philosophy: but of the polity established by Romulus I
thought these points worth recording.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such, we see were the opinions entertained by the best philosophers, and by
the ancient and most eminent men of the Roman empire concerning the theology of
the Greeks----opinions which give no admission to physical theories in their
legends concerning the gods, nor to their gorgeous and sophistical impostures.</p>
<p>Since, however, we have once entered upon their refutation, let us go on and
consider their interpretations and theories, to see what, after all, they carry
with them that is venerable and worthy of the gods; and let us not say anything
as of ourselves, but make use, on all points, of their own words, so that we may
again learn their views from themselves.</p>
