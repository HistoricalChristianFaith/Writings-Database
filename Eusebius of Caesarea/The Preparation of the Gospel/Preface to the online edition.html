<p align="center"><b>Eusebius of Caesarea: Praeparatio Evangelica (Preparation
for the Gospel). Tr. E.H. Gifford (1903) -- Preface to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>E.H.Gifford published his massive edition and translation in 5 volumes in
1903.&nbsp; Vol. 1 and vol. 2 contained the Greek.&nbsp; Vol. 3 was split into
two physical volumes -- part 1 and part 2.&nbsp; This contained the English
translation that appears here.&nbsp; Vol. 4 was the last, and contained the
notes, mainly philological.&nbsp; The English translation was also reprinted
separately.&nbsp; This remains the only English translation.</p>

<p>His edition has been superceded by that of Karl Mras, Eusebius Werke 8, in
the 'Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller' series 43 Berlin (1954-6).&nbsp;
This text is reprinted by the French editors J. Sirinelli and Edouard des Places
in the Sources Chr&eacute;tiennes series.&nbsp; Sirinelli &amp;c. also included a
French translation.</p>
<p>At the head of each book stands a summary, formatted in this edition as a
table of contents.&nbsp; These are found in most of the manuscripts, and are
generally considered to be authorial by editors such as K. Mras or J.
Sirinelli.&nbsp; In the medieval manuscripts, the text is divided into chapters
and excerpts from the summary placed at the head of each 'chapter' as a chapter
title.&nbsp; It is very hard to find definite information, but the division into
chapters is probably later than Eusebius, as is the creation of the chapter
titles.&nbsp; The works of St. Augustine, for instance, were divided into
chapters in the 6th century, and an early 5th century manuscript of his <i>De
Civitate Dei</i>, from Africa, and quite likely from his own scriptorium, has
none.&nbsp; (Augustine did however compose summaries of the contents, which
circulated separately.)&nbsp; As may be seen from book 1, even in Gifford's
version, the chapter divisions do not in fact match the numbered sentences in
the summaries, again indicating that the division in chapters is later than the
author of the summaries.</p>

<p>The <i>Praeparatio</i> is perhaps best known from a narrow-minded attempt by
Edward Gibbon in his <i>Vindication</i> to use it to 'prove' that Eusebius
advocated deceit.&nbsp; The smear needs little discussion here. While Gibbon
would like us to believe that Eusebius is really saying in book 12, chapter 31 that the
bible is a lie so deceit is fine, some will feel that instead that it is simply part of his theme that
the bible contains narrative fiction in order to get conceptually difficult truths into the
uneducated.&nbsp; The reader is invited to read all of book 12 and decide for
themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is one problem with the translation, which is as annoying as
unnecessary.&nbsp; For some reason, Gifford did not always translate the
summaries literally, but felt free to add to them, combine, abbreviate or alter
them, in order to use them as table of contents himself.&nbsp; Possibly this is
because the Greek numbers in the summaries do not align with the chapter
divisions.&nbsp; He did not however place them in the text as per the
manuscripts, as is done in Mras and Sirinelli.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To illustrate the sort of changes Gifford made, I have rendered as literally
as I can from Sirinelli's French translation the Greek summary of book 1 (which
is divided into 10 chapters) as follows:</p>

<p>It would be useful if someone with more Greek than myself would translate
these again, to replace the defective versions in Gifford, particularly since
both Mras and Sirinelli suggest that they may be by Eusebius himself.</p>

<p>Gifford also used Gibbon's mistranslation of <i>pseudos</i> as 'falsehood' in
the entry and text of book 12, chapter 31.&nbsp; The word is rendered 'fiction'
in R.G. Bury's Loeb edition (1967, book 2, 663D-E, p.125) of Plato's <i>Laws</i>,
which seems to fit the sense better, unless we are to suppose Eusebius to mean
that the Hebrew scriptures contain intentional falsehoods!&nbsp; Modern readers will be aware of the
difference between a lie and a piece of educational fiction, but the confusion is not uncommon among
uneducated people, even today.</p>

<p>The manuscripts are discussed in detail by Mras.&nbsp; These are the extant
manuscripts.</p>

      Written by a monk, Longinus, who gives his name in the subscriptio on

      Areopagite).&nbsp; On fol. 207v is a notice which tells us that a certain

      of Ainos.&nbsp;
      <p>Soon afterwards it came to Italy.&nbsp; It was prepared for sale in the
      16th century by the addition of a paper double-sheet glued on the front
      (since become detached), and a majuscule title added. In the 17th century,
      the MS belonged to the orientalist A. Galland, who gave it to the royal

<p>There are thus two classes of manuscript: <b>A</b>, supplemented by <b>H</b>;
and on the other hand <b>BOVND</b>, with <b>B</b> transitional.</p>

<p>There are also substantial citations in Theodoret, <i>Gr&aelig;carum affectionum
curatio (Remedy for the diseases of the Greeks)</i>.&nbsp; These vary between
the two families.&nbsp; George Trapezuntios made a Latin translation.&nbsp; The earliest known
edition is from Venice in 1470 via Nicolaus Jenson.&nbsp; This seems to be based
on <b>I</b> or <b>j</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>D</b> and <b>E</b> were the basis of the Robert Stephanus edition of 1544.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The process of converting the printed text to HTML was somewhat
awkward.&nbsp; Gifford used the format favoured by the Oxford Movement
translations of the 1840's, with much use of the margin, and introduced some
innovations himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The page numbers of vols. 3 and 4 are very small, and Gifford himself ignores
them.&nbsp; Instead he placed the page numbers of the Greek in the margin,
together with the division of the page into four sections, labelled a, b, c and
d, also in the margin.&nbsp; The footnotes appear at the bottom of the page, and
use the Greek page number, section, and line number of the printed text.&nbsp;
Thus 123 c 11 would be the 11th line after the marginal 'c' following the
'p.123' in the margin.</p>

<p>For an online edition, these reference points would be almost impossible to
transcribe.&nbsp; They have been omitted.&nbsp; Instead convention footnote
numbers have been created, and linked to the notes which have been necessarily
moved to the end.&nbsp; Usually Gifford's ref. is preserved, however.</p>

<p>The majority of the work consists of large near-verbatim chunks copied from
pagan philosophers.&nbsp; Often these are now lost, which gives the work its
value.&nbsp; Gifford set these in a slightly smaller font-size, so that
Eusebius' comments stood out.&nbsp; The citations also are in single
quotes.&nbsp; I have been unable to find a format which works online as well, so
the citations are in the same size font.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gifford also placed at the head of each page, in the margin the name of the
current philosopher in capitals, and often when a new one was introduced.&nbsp;
This has been represented by using [PLATO] etc at the start of a new chunk of
text, as seemed appropriate.</p>

<p>The edition is around 1000 pages, and has been very hard to scan.&nbsp; Peter
Kirby and I have been discussing the idea for a couple of years, without
result.&nbsp; My own attempt to scan book 12 ground to a halt, as the format
chosen was too difficult for the time available.&nbsp; The project got off the
ground a few months ago when Peter scanned the introduction, and then book 1
with selected embedded footnotes, then 3, 5, and 6.&nbsp; In response I started
to work on scanning other books, starting with 2 and 4, evolving a format as we
went, and reformatted or added footnotes to his books. Unfortunately we had
neglected to keep in touch as closely as we might, and both of us did book
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In most books, every footnote has been included.&nbsp; In some of those books
done first, some biblical references have been omitted, and this is indicated by
the legend 'selected footnotes.'&nbsp; The order of scanning was 1-6, then 15
down to 7.&nbsp; I entered Greek text using the SPIonic font with polytonic
accents *; Peter in unicode without accents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
