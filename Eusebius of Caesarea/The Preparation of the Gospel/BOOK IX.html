<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>Now since we have surveyed the proofs that our acceptance of the Hebrew
oracles has not been made without just reasoning, but with carefully tested
judgement and thought, it is time to observe that the most illustrious of the
Greeks themselves have not been unacquainted with the affairs of the Hebrews;
but some of them testified to the truth of the historical narratives current
among them as well as to their mode of life, while others treated doctrinal
theology also in the same manner as they did.</p>
<p>I will bring forward in the first place the subjects which naturally come
first, showing how many of the Greek historians have mentioned by name both Jews
and Hebrews, and the philosophy anciently taught and practised among them, as
well as the history of their forefathers from the earliest times.</p>
<p>And I shall begin my account with their mode of life, so as to teach you that
it is not without sober reasoning that we have preferred their philosophy to
that of the Greeks.</p>
<p>At all events not only their own sacred books, but also the most illustrious
of the Greek philosophers, famous even in our own day, bear witness that the
duties of practical morality are performed by them in accordance with the rules
which have been already examined in the preceding Book. So now take and read the
statements of Theophrastus contained in the writings of Porphyry <i>On
Abstinence from Animal Food, </i>as follows:</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>[PORPHYRY] <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> 'NEVERTHELESS,' says Theophrastus,
'though the Syrians [of Judaea], because of their original mode of sacrifice,
continue to offer animal sacrifices at the present time, if any one were to bid
us sacrifice in the same way, we should revolt from the practice. For instead of
feasting upon what had been sacrificed, they made a whole burnt-offering of it
by night, and by pouring much honey and wine over it they consumed the sacrifice
more quickly, in order that even the all-seeing sun might not be a spectator of
the dreadful deed.</p>
<p>'And while doing this they fast throughout the intermediate days; and all
this time, as being a nation of philosophers, they converse with one another
about the Deity, and at night they contemplate the heavenly bodies, looking up
to them, and calling upon God in prayers. For these were the first to dedicate
both the other animals, and themselves, which last they did from necessity and
not from any desire.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>ALSO in the fourth book of the same treatise Porphyry narrates concerning the
same people such things as the following:</p>
<p>[PORPHYRY] <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> 'The Essenes then are Jews by birth,
but united among themselves even more closely than the rest of the Jews.</p>
<p>'They abhor pleasures as wickedness, and regard self-control and resistance
to the passions as virtue. Marriage they disdain for themselves, but choose the
sons of others while still easily moulded towards learning; and regarding them
as their kindred, impress them with their own moral dispositions: thus without
destroying marriage, and the succession of the race thereby produced, they guard
themselves against the wantonness of women.</p>
<p>'They despise riches, and there is among them a wonderful community of goods,
so that it is impossible to find any one exceeding others in wealth. For they
have a law that those who eater the sect give up their substance to the common
fund of the order, so that among them all there is seen neither humiliation of
poverty nor excess of wealth; but every one's possessions being mixed up
together, they all have one property like brothers.</p>
<p>'Oil they consider a defilement, and if any one be anointed against his will,
he has his body wiped: for they think it becoming to have a dry skin, and always
to wear white.</p>
<p>'The superintendents of their common interests are elected, and they are
severally chosen for their offices by the whole body. They have no one city of
their own, but a number of them make their abode in each city, and their means
are mutually thrown open to those of the sect who have come from elsewhere; and
they are received as familiar friends by those whom they have never seen before:
for which reason when they travel they bring nothing with them for expenses.</p>
<p>'They change neither robe nor sandals before they are altogether ragged, or
worn out by time. They neither buy nor sell anything, but each gives what he has
himself to the man that wants it, and receives from him in return what is useful
to him: and even without this return there is no hindrance to their getting a
share from whomsoever they will.</p>
<p>'With regard to the Deity, however, their piety is of a peculiar kind. For
they utter no common words before the sun has risen, but address to him certain
prayers handed down by their fathers, as if entreating him to rise. After this
they are dismissed by the superintendents to the crafts known to each, and after
working vigorously till the fifth hour they then assemble again in one place,
and having girded themselves with loin-cloths, so proceed to wash their body
with cold water.</p>
<p>'After this purification they meet in a building of their own, in which none
of another sect is permitted to join them; but being themselves purified, they
come into the dining-room as if entering some holy place. And when they have
quietly taken their seats, the baker sets loaves in a row before them, and the
cook sets before each a single dish of one kind of meat. Then the priest first
says a prayer over the food, as being pure and clean, and it is unlawful for any
to taste the food before the prayer. And when they have finished the meal he
again offers a prayer, and thus they honour God both at the beginning and at the
end.</p>
<p>'Then they lay aside their robes as holy, and turn to work again till
evening; when they come back and sup in like manner, the guests sitting down
with them, if there happen to be any present.</p>
<p>'And neither clamour nor tumult ever profanes their house, but in
conversation they give way in turn to each other; and to those outside the
silence of those within seems like some awful mystery. The cause of this is
their constant sobriety, and their limitation of food and drink to the
satisfying of hunger.</p>
<p>'To those who desire to join the sect admission is not immediately granted,
but for the space of a year while one remains outside they prescribe the same
mode of life, and give him a shovel, an apron, and a white robe. And when in
this period he has given proof of self-control, he approaches more nearly to
their mode of life, and partakes of the purer waters for ablution.</p>
<p>'He is not, however, admitted as yet to the life of the community. For after
the proof of his endurance his moral disposition is tested by two more years,
and, if found worthy, he is then enrolled in their company.</p>
<p>'But before he touches the common food, they make him swear tremendous oaths:
first that he will reverently worship God, then that he will observe justice
towards men, and will harm no man either of his own will or under command, but
will always hate the unjust and succour the righteous; that he will show
fidelity to all, but especially to those in power, for it is not without God's
will that the government is acquired by any man: also that, if he be himself a
ruler, he will never be insolent in using his authority, nor outshine his
subjects in dress or any excessive adornment: that he will always love the
truth, and expose liars; keep his hands clear of theft, and his soul of unholy
gain; and will neither hide anything from the members of the sect, nor disclose
any secret of theirs to others, though any one should press him by violence even
unto death.</p>
<p>'In addition to this, he swears that to no one will he impart their doctrines
otherwise than he himself received them, and will abstain from, robbery, and
will guard with equal care the books of their sect, and the names of the angels.</p>
<p>'Such are the oaths; and those who are found guilty and expelled, perish by a
miserable fate. For being bound by their oaths and by their customs, they cannot
partake of the food which other men have, but eating grass and wasting away by
famine, they thus perish. So for this reason they have taken compassion upon
many in the extremity of their distress, and received them back, considering
that they had suffered punishment enough for their offences in being thus
tortured to death.</p>
<p>'The shovel they give to those who intend to be members of the sect, because
they do not themselves sit down without having dug a trench a foot deep, and
covered themselves with their cloak, so as not to insult the eyes of God. And so
great is their simplicity and sparingness in regard to food, that they do not
need to ease nature on the seventh day, which they are accustomed to keep for
singing hymns to God and for rest.</p>
<p>'From this asceticism they have acquired so great endurance, that though they
be racked and wrenched and burned, and pass through all the instruments of
torture, in order to make them blaspheme their Lawgiver, or eat some
unaccustomed food, they cannot endure to do either.</p>
<p>'And this they clearly showed in the war against the Romans: since they
cannot endure either to fawn on their tormentors, or to shed tears, but smiling
in the midst of their pains, and bantering those who applied the tortures, they
cheerfully gave up their lives with the hope of receiving them again. For indeed
this opinion is firmly fixed among them, that though their bodies are
perishable, and their material substance not lasting, their souls remain for
ever immortal; and coming from the subtlest ether, drawn down by some natural
force, they become entangled with the body, but when they are released from the
bonds of the flesh they then rejoice, as if delivered from long bondage, and are
borne up aloft.</p>
<p>'From such a mode of life then, and from their training in truth and piety,
there are naturally many among them, who even foreknow the tilings to come, as
being brought up among sacred books, and various purifications and utterances of
the prophets: and they seldom, if ever, go wrong in their predictions.'</p>
<p>This was the testimony of Porphyry, drawn probably from ancient records, both
to the piety and the philosophy of the persons aforesaid, in the fourth book of
his careful work <i>On Abstinence from Animal Food.</i></p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>BUT Hecataeus of Abdera, who was both a philosopher and very competent in
active life, devoted a special book to the history of the Jews, and gives very
many details concerning them, from which it will for the present suffice to
quote the following:</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> 'For most of the strongholds and
villages in the country belong to the Jews; and one strong city Jerusalem, about
fifty furlongs in circumference, which is inhabited by about a hundred and
twenty thousand men, and is called Hierosolyma.</p>
<p>'And here about the middle of the city is a stone enclosure, about five
hundred feet in length, and a hundred cubits wide, with two gates: and herein is
a square altar, of unhewn stones collected and just put together in a rough
state, twenty cubits long on each side, and the height ten cubits.</p>
<p>'And beside it is a large building, wherein, is an altar and a candlestick,
both of gold, two talents in weight: and upon these is a light which is never
extinguished either day or night. But there is no image nor any votive offering
at all, nor any plant, absolutely nothing of the nature of a grove or anything
of this kind. 'And there arc priests who pass both their nights and days in the
temple, performing certain purifications, and never drinking any wine while
there.'</p>
<p>After these statements, lower down:</p>
<p>'He has borne witness that they also served in the army of king Alexander,
and afterwards of his successors. And I will quote what he says was done by a
Jew in the expedition when he was himself present: he speaks as follows:</p>
<p>'When therefore I was marching towards the Red Sea, among the other Jewish
horsemen who escorted us, we were accompanied by a man named Mosollam, a person
of great spirit, and good strength, and acknowledged by all to be the best
archer among either the Greeks or Barbarians.</p>
<p>'So while many were marching along the road, and a certain soothsayer was
taking auguries, and requiring all to halt, this man asked what they were
waiting for. And when the soothsayer showed him the bird, and said, that if it
remained in the same place, it was expedient for all to halt, but if it rose and
flew forward, they should advance, and if it flew back, they must retire again,
then this man made no reply, but drew his bow and shot, and hit the bird and
killed it.</p>
<p>'And when the soothsayer and some others were indignant and began to curse
him, he said, Why are ye so mad, unhappy men? Then taking the bird into his
hands, he said, For how could this bird, which could not foresee how to save
itself, have given us any sound information concerning our march? For had it
been able to foreknow what would happen, it would not have come to this place,
for fear lest Mosollam the Jew should shoot at and kill it. These are the
statements of Hecataeus.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> 'BUT Clearchus the Peripatetic
philosopher, in his first book <i>Concerning Sleep, </i>attributes to Aristotle
the philosopher a statement such as follows concerning the Jews, writing word
for word thus:</p>
<p>'But though it would be too long to tell the greater part, it will not be
amiss to go through those of his statements which are alike marvellous and
philosophical. Now, said he, understand clearly, Hyperochides, I shall seem to
you to relate what is as marvellous as dreams. Then Hyperochides modestly
replied, Yes, that is the very reason why we all desire to hear it.</p>
<p>'Well then, said Aristotle, according to the rule of the rhetoricians, let us
first describe the man's origin, that we may not disobey the teachers of the
narrative style.</p>
<p>'Tell it so, if you please, said Hyperochides.</p>
<p>'Well then, the man was by origin a Jew, from Coele-Syria. Now these are
descendants of the philosophers of India; and philosophers, it is said, are
called among the Indians Calani, but among the Syrians they are called Judaeans,
having taken their name from the place. For the place which they inhabit is
called Judaea: and the name of their city is very awkward, for they call it
Hierusalem.</p>
<p>'This man then, who was hospitably entertained by many on his way down from
the inland districts to the sea-coasts, was Greek not only in language but also
in spirit. And as at that time we were dwelling in Asia, the man having landed
in the same neighbourhood fell into conversation with us and some others of the
studious sort, to make trial of their wisdom. And as he had lived in intimacy
with many of the learned, he imparted somewhat more than he received.'</p>
<p>Such is the story of Clearchus.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>THIS man is mentioned also by our Clement in his first <i>Miscellany, </i>in
what he says as follows:</p>
<p>[CLEMENT] <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> 'Clearchus the Peripatetic says that
he knew a Jew who associated with Aristotle.'</p>
<p>And afterwards he adds:</p>
<p>'But Numa the king of the Romans, though he was a Pythagorean, received
benefit from the teaching of Moses, and forbade the Romans to make an image of
God in the shape of man or any animal. So in the first hundred and seventy
years, though they built themselves temples, they made no image, neither in
sculpture nor yet in painting.</p>
<p>'For Numa used to teach them in secret, that it was not possible for the
Perfect Good to be reached by language, but only by the mind.'</p>
<p>Further than this, in what follows below, he speaks thus: <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></p>
<p>'But most plainly does Megasthenes, the historian who lived with Seleucus
Nicator, write as follows in his third book <i>On Indian Affairs.</i></p>
<p>'All that has been said about nature among the ancients is said also among
the philosophers outside Greece, partly among the Indians by the Brachmans, and
partly in Syria by those who are called Jews.'</p>
<p>Besides this Clement also mentions Aristobulus the Peripatetic and Numenius
the Pythagorean, saying: <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></p>
<p>'Aristobulus, in his first book addressed to Philometor, writes in these
words: Plato too has followed our legislation, and has evidently studied
carefully the several precepts contained in it.</p>
<p>'And others before Demetrius, and prior to the supremacy of Alexander and of
the Persians, have translated both the narrative of the Exodus of our fellow
countrymen the Hebrews from Egypt, and the fame of all that happened to them,
and their conquest of the land, and the exposition of the whole Law.</p>
<p>'So it is perfectly clear that the philosopher before-mentioned has borrowed
much, for he is very learned; as also was Pythagoras, who transferred many of
our precepts into his own system of doctrines.</p>
<p>'And Numenius, the Pythagorean philosopher, writes expressly: &quot;For what
is Plato, but Moses speaking in Attic Greek?&quot; '</p>
<p>So far Clement.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>ALSO from the Pythagorean philosopher himself, I mean Numenius, I will quote
as follows from his first book <i>On the Good:</i></p>
<p>[NUMENIUS] <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> 'But when one has spoken upon this
point, and sealed it by the testimonies of Plato, it will be necessary to go
back and connect it with the precepts of Pythagoras, and to appeal to the
nations of good repute, bringing forward their rites and doctrines, and their
institutions which are formed in agreement with those of Plato, all that the
Brachmans, and Jews, and Magi, and Egyptians arranged.'</p>
<p>So much then on these points.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>ALSO in his third book the same author makes mention of Moses, speaking as
follows: <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></p>
<p>'And next in order came Jannes and Jambres, Egyptian sacred scribes, men
judged to have no superiors in the practice of magic, at the time when the Jews
were being driven out of Egypt.</p>
<p>'So then these were the men chosen by the people of Egypt as fit to stand
beside Musaeus, who led forth the Jews, a man who was most powerful in prayer to
God; and of the plagues which Musaeus brought upon Egypt, these men showed
themselves able to disperse the most violent.'</p>
<p>Now by these words Numenius bears witness both to the marvellous wonders
performed by Moses, and to Moses himself as having been beloved of God.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> 'CHOERILUS also, an ancient poet,
has mentioned the Jewish nation, and how they served with king Xerxes in his
expedition against Greece. And thus he speaks:</p>

          <p>&quot;Next passed a nation wondrous to behold,&nbsp;<br>
          Whose lips pronounced the strange Phoenician tongue;&nbsp;<br>
          Upon the hills of Solyma they dwelt&nbsp;<br>
          By the broad inland sea. Rough and unkempt&nbsp;<br>
          Their close-cropped hair, and on their heads they wore&nbsp;<br>

<p>'Now that he spake this concerning Jews is evident from the fact that
Hierosolyma lies on the mountains called by the Greeks Solyma, and that near it
is the Asphaltic lake, which is very broad as the poet says, and larger than any
of the lakes in Syria.'</p>
<p>Such then is this man's testimony.</p>
<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>BUT Porphyry, in the first book of his <i>Philosophy from Oracles, </i>introduces
his own god as himself bearing witness to the wisdom of the Hebrew race as well
as of the other nations renowned for intelligence.</p>
<p>It is his Apollo who speaks as follows in an oracle which he is uttering; and
while still explaining the subject of sacrifices, he adds words which are well
worthy of attention, as being full of all divine knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>[PORPHYRY] 'Steep is the road and rough that leads to heaven,&nbsp;<br>
          Entered at first through portals bound with brass.&nbsp;<br>
          Within are found innumerable paths,&nbsp;<br>
          Which for the endless good of all mankind&nbsp;<br>
          They first revealed, who Nile's sweet waters drink.&nbsp;<br>
          From them the heavenward paths Phoenicia learned,&nbsp;<br>
          Assyria, Lydia, and the Hebrew race:'&nbsp; <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth: on which the author further remarks:</p>
<p>'For the road to the gods is bound with brass, and both steep and rough; the
barbarians discovered many paths thereof, but the Greeks went astray, and those
who already held it even perverted it. The discovery was ascribed by the god to
Egyptians, Phoenicians, Chaldeans (for these are the Assyrians), Lydians, and
Hebrews.</p>
<p>'In addition to this Apollo also says in another oracle:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Only Chaldees and Hebrews wisdom found&nbsp;<br>
          In the pure worship of a self-born God.&quot;&nbsp; <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'And being asked again, for what reason men speak of many heavens, he gave
the following response:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;One circle girds the world on every side,&nbsp;<br>
          In seven zones rising to the starlit paths:&nbsp;<br>
          These, in their sevenfold orbits as they roll,&nbsp;<br>
          Chaldees and far-famed Hebrews 'heavens' surnamed.&quot;'</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;With regard then to the name Jews and Hebrews, and their religion and
philosophy of old renown, let these extracts suffice: but concerning their
ancestral history observe how many writers have agreed.</p>
<p>Moses, in his ancient history of the whole world, had given an account of a
deluge, and how he whom the Hebrews call Noe was preserved with his family in an
ark made of wood; and Josephus, in the first book of his <i>Antiquities, </i>sets
forth in the following manner how the historical writers. Berossus the Chaldee,
and Hieronymus the Egyptian, and Nicolaus of Damascus, make mention of the same
things.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> 'THIS deluge and the ark are
mentioned by all who have written histories of the Barbarians, among whom is
Berossus the Chaldean. For in narrating the circumstances of the flood, he
describes it thus:</p>
<p>'It is said that there is still a portion of the vessel in Armenia near the
mountain of the Cordyaei, and that persons scrape off and carry away some of the
pitch. And the people use what they carry away chiefly for charms to avert
misfortunes.</p>
<p>'This is mentioned also by Hieronymus the Egyptian, who wrote <i>The
Archaeology of Phoenicia, </i>and by Mnaseas, and several others. Nicolaus also
of Damascus gives an account of them in his ninety-sixth book, speaking thus:
There is above Minyas a great mountain in Armenia called Baris, to which, as the
story goes, many fled for refuge at the time of the deluge and were saved; and a
certain man borne on an ark landed on the top of the mountain, and the remains
of the timbers were preserved for a long time. Now this must be the same of whom
Moses, the Lawgiver of the Jews, wrote.'</p>
<p>So writes Josephus.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>BUT after mentioning the Median and Assyrian records from the work of
Abydenus, I will set before you his statements concerning this same story, as
follows:</p>
<p>[ABYDENUS] <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> 'After him reigned among others
Sisithrus, to whom Kronos foretold that there would be a great rain on the
fifteenth day of Desius, and commanded him to hide everything connected with
literature at Heliopolis in the country of the Sippari.</p>
<p>'And when Sisithrus had accomplished this, he straightway sailed up towards
Armenia, and immediately what God had predicted overtook him. But on the third
day, when the rain had abated, he proceeded to let loose some of the birds, to
try whether they saw land anywhere that had emerged from the water.</p>
<p>'But as they were met by a vast unbroken ocean, and were at a loss where to
find a haven, they came safe back to Sisithrus, and others after them did the
same.</p>
<p>'But when he was successful with the third set, for they came back with their
feet full of mud, the gods removed him from men's sight: but in Armenia the ship
supplied the people of the country with wooden amulets as antidotes to poison.'</p>
<p>These then are his statements.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>BUT again, as Moses asserted that the first generations of mankind had been
long-lived, Josephus brings forward the Greek writers as witnesses of this
statement also, speaking as follows:</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> 'From comparing the life of the
men of old with the life now, and the short years that we live, let no one
suppose that the statements concerning the former are false, inferring that they
did not attain to that length of life from the fact that men do not now extend
the time of their life so long.</p>
<p>'For as they were beloved of God, and created by God Himself, and as their
kinds of food were better fitted for a longer continuance, it was natural for
them to live so many years.</p>
<p>'Further, God may have granted them a longer life on account of their virtue,
and the usefulness of the arts which they invented, astronomy and geometry,
things which they could not have announced with certainty, had they not lived at
least six hundred years, for by that number the great year is completed.</p>
<p>'And the truth of my argument is testified by all who have written on ancient
history among Greeks and Barbarians. For both Manetho who recorded the <i>Egyptian
History, </i>and Berossus who collected the Chaldean annals, and Molos, and
Hestiaeus, and in addition to them the Egyptian Hieronymus, and the compilers of
Phoenician history, agree with what I say. Hesiod too, and Hecataeus, and
Hellanicus, and Acusilaus, and besides these Ephorus and Nicolaus record that
the ancients lived a thousand years. So on these matters let men speculate each
as it may please him.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>AGAIN, whereas Moses wrote an account of the building of the tower, and how
from one language men passed into the confusion of many dialects, the author
just before mentioned, in his work entitled <i>Of Assyrian History,</i> bears
the like testimony, speaking as follows:</p>
<p>[ABYDENUS] <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 'But there are some who say that
the men who first arose out of the earth, being puffed up by their strength and
great stature, and proudly thinking that they were better than the gods, raised
a huge tower, where Babylon now stands: and when they were already nearer to
heaven, the winds came to the help of the gods, and overthrew their structure
upon them, the ruins of which were called Babylon. And being up to that time of
one tongue, they received from the gods a confused language; and afterwards war
arose between Cronos and Titan.</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> 'And the place in which they built
the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of what at first was
clear in their language. For the Hebrews call confusion &quot;Babel.&quot; '</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<p>'THE Sibyl also mentions this tower and the diversity of language among
mankind, speaking thus: <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A></p>
<p>'&quot;When all mankind were of one language, some built a very lofty tower,
intending by it to mount up to heaven. But the gods sent winds against the tower
and overthrew it, and gave to each man a peculiar language, and for this reason
it came to pass that the city was called Babylon.&quot; And the plain which is
called Sennaar in the country of Babylonia is mentioned by Hestiaeus, who speaks
thus: &quot;But those of the priests who escaped took the sacred things of Zeus
Enyalios, and came to Sennaar in Babylonia: afterwards they were scattered
thence, and everywhere formed their communities from speaking the same language,
and took possession of the land which each lighted upon.&quot;'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>
<p>AGAIN, as Moses has set forth at large the history of Abraham the forefather
of the Hebrews, Josephus says that the foreign historians also bear witness to
him, writing as follows:</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> 'Berossus mentions our father
Abraham, not by name, but in these terms: &quot;In the tenth generation after
the flood there was among the Chaldeans a righteous and great man, experienced
also in heavenly things.&quot;</p>
<p>'But Hecataeus has done something more than mentioning him; for he left
behind him a book which he had composed concerning him.</p>
<p>'And Nicolaus Damascenus, in the fourth book of his <i>Histories, </i>speaks
thus:<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> &quot;Abraham was king of Damascus, having
come as a stranger with an army from the land which lies beyond Babylon, called
Chaldaea. But after no long time he removed from this country also, and migrated
with his own people into what was then called Canaan, but now Judaea, and so did
afterwards the multitude of his descendants, concerning whom I shall relate in
another discourse what is recorded in history. Even now the name of Abraham is
glorified in the district of Damascus, and a village is pointed out which is
called from him the <i>Habitation of Abraham.&quot;</i></p>
<p>'When in later times a famine had fallen upon the land of Canaan, Abraham
having been informed that the Egyptians were in prosperity was eager to cross
over to them, both to partake of their abundance, and to be a hearer of their
priests, to learn what they said about the gods; intending either to follow
them, if they were found superior, or to bring them over to the better belief,
if his own opinions were preferable.'</p>
<p>Then next he adds:</p>
<p>'And he associated with the most learned of the Egyptians, and the result was
that his virtue and his consequent reputation became more illustrious from this
cause.</p>
<p>'For whereas the Egyptians delight in different customs, and disparage one
another's usages, and are for this reason ill-disposed towards each other, he by
conferring with them severally, and discussing the arguments which they used in
defence of their own practices, proved them to be empty and devoid of all truth.</p>
<p>'Being therefore admired by them in their conferences as a very wise man, and
strong not only in intelligence but also in persuasive speech on whatever
subjects he undertook to teach, he freely imparts to them the science of
arithmetic, and also communicates to them the facts of astronomy. For before
Abraham's arrival the Egyptians were ignorant of these subjects; for they passed
from the Chaldees into Egypt, and thence came also to the Greeks.'</p>
<p>So writes Josephus.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII</p>
<p>AND with this agrees also Alexander Polyhistor, a man of great intellect and
much learning, and very well known to those Greeks who have gathered the fruits
of education in no perfunctory manner: for in his compilation, <i>Concerning the
Jews, </i>he records the history of this man Abraham in the following manner
word for word:</p>
<p>[ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR] <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> 'Eupolemus in his book
<i>Concerning the Jews of Assyria </i>says that the city Babylon was first
founded by those who escaped from the Deluge; and that they were giants, and
built the tower renowned in history.</p>
<p>'But when this had been overthrown by the act of God, the giants were
dispersed over the whole earth. And in the tenth generation, he says, in
Camarina a city of Babylonia, which some call the city Uria (and which is by
interpretation <i>the city of the Chaldees</i>),<i> +</i> in the thirteenth
generation + Abraham was born, who surpassed all men in nobility and wisdom, who
was also the inventor of astronomy and the Chaldaic art, and pleased God well by
his zeal towards religion.</p>
<p>'By reason of God's commands this man came and dwelt in Phoenicia, and
pleased their king by teaching the Phoenicians the changes of the sun and moon
and all things of that kind. And afterwards the Armenians invaded the
Phoenicians; and when they had been victorious, and had taken his nephew
prisoner, Abraham came to the rescue with his servants, and prevailed over the
captors, and made prisoners of the wives and children of the enemy.</p>
<p>'And when there came to him ambassadors asking that he would ransom them for
money, he did not choose to trample upon the unfortunate, but on receiving food
for his young men restored the booty; he was also admitted as a guest into the
temple of the city called Argarizin, which being interpreted is &quot;Mount of
the Most High,&quot; and received gifts from Melchizedek, who was the king, and
the priest of God.</p>
<p>'But when there came a famine Abraham removed into Egypt with all his
household, and dwelt there, and the king of Egypt took his wife in marriage,
Abraham having said that she was his sister.</p>
<p>'He also related fully that the king was unable to consort with her, and that
it came to pass that his people and his household were perishing. And when he
had called for the soothsayers, they said that the woman was not a widow; and
thus the king of Egypt learned that she was Abraham's wife, and gave her back to
her husband.</p>
<p>'And Abraham dwelt with the Egyptian priests in Heliopolis and taught them
many things; and it was he who introduced astronomy and the other sciences to
them, saying that the Babylonians and himself had found these things out, but
tracing back the first discovery to Enoch, and saying that he, and not the
Egyptians, had first invented astrology.</p>
<p>'For the Babylonians say that the first man was Belus, who is Kronos; and
that of him was born a son Belus, and Chanaan; and that this Chanaan begat the
father of the Phoenicians, and that his son was Churn, who is called by the
Greeks Asbolus, and is father of the Aethiopians, and a brother of Mestraim the
father of the Egyptians. But the Greeks say that Atlas invented astrology, and
that Atlas is the same as Enoch: and that Enoch had a son Methuselah, who
learned all things through angels of God, and thus we gained our knowledge.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII</p>
<p>'ARTABANUS in his <i>Jewish History </i>says that the Jews were called
Ermiuth, which when interpreted after the Greek language means Judaeans, and
that they were called Hebrews from Abraham. And he, they say, came with all his
household into Egypt, to Pharethothes the king of the Egyptians, and taught him
astrology; and after remaining there twenty years, removed back again into the
regions of Syria: but that many of those who had come with him remained in Egypt
because of the prosperity of the country.</p>
<p>'In certain anonymous works, however, we found that Abraham traced Lack his
origin to the giants, and that they dwelling in Babylonia were destroyed by the
gods for their impiety; but that one of them, named Belus, escaped death and
settled in Babylon, and lived in a tower which he had built, and which was
called Belus from the Belus who built it: and that Abraham having been
instructed in the science of astrology came first into Phoenicia, and taught
astrology to the Phoenicians, and afterwards passed on into Egypt.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
<p>'BUT Molon, the author of the collection <i>Against the Jews, </i>says that
at the time of the Deluge the man who survived departed from Armenia with his
sons, being driven out of his home by the people of the land; and after crossing
the intermediate country came into the mountain-district of Syria which was
uninhabited.</p>
<p>'After three generations Abraham was born, whose name is by interpretation
&quot;Father's friend,&quot; and that he became a wise man, and travelled
through the desert. And having taken two wives, the one of his own country and
kindred, and the other an Egyptian handmaiden, he begat by the Egyptian twelve
sons, who went off into Arabia and divided the land among them, and were the
first who reigned over the people of the country: from which circumstance there
are even in our own day twelve kings of the Arabians, bearing the same names as
the first.</p>
<p>'But by his lawful wife he had one son, whose name in Greek is <span class="Greek">&#x0393;&#x1F73;&#x03BB;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>,
&quot;laughter.&quot; Abraham died of old age, but Gelos and a wife of his own
country had eleven sons, and a twelfth, Joseph, and Moses was in the third
generation from him.'</p>
<p>So much says Polyhistor; and to this he adds, after some sentences, what
follows:</p>
<p>'But not long after God commanded Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a whole
burnt-offering to Him. And he led his son up to the mountain, and heaped up a
pyre, and set Isaac thereon; but when about to slay him he was forbidden by an
Angel, who provided him with a ram for the offering: and Abraham took down his
son from the pyre, and offered the ram.'</p>

<p>and the rest that follows this.'</p>
<p>This then from the fore-mentioned work of Polyhistor. But Josephus also in
the first book of his <i>Antiquities </i>mentions the same author in the
following passage:</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> 'Now it is said that this Afren
made an expedition into Libya and subdued it; and his grandsons having settled
there called the land Africa after his name.</p>
<p>'And my statement is confirmed by Alexander Polyhistor, who speaks thus:</p>
<p>'&quot;But Cleodemus the prophet, who is also called Malchas, in narrating
the history of the Jews even as Moses their Lawgiver has narrated it, says that
by Chettura Abraham had many sons: and he also mentions their names, calling
three of them Afer, Assur, and Afran.</p>
<p>'And from Assur Assyria was named; and from the other two, Afra and Afer, a
city Afra and the country Africa. And these, he says, joined Hercules in his
expedition against Libya and Antaeus: and Hercules having married the daughter
of Afra begat of her a son Diodorus. And of him was born Sophonas, from whom the
barbarian Sophae are called.&quot; '</p>
<p>Let it suffice then that the story of Abraham is briefly set forth in these
quotations.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXI</p>
<p>Now let us return to Polyhistor.</p>
<p>[ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR] <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> 'Demetrius says that
when Jacob was seventy (seven) years old he fled to Charran in Mesopotamia,
having been sent away by his parents on account of the secret enmity with his
brother Esau (the cause of which was that his father had blessed him thinking
that he was Esau), and also in order that he might take a wife from that
country.</p>
<p>'Jacob therefore set out for Charran in Mesopotamia, having left his father
Isaac a hundred and thirty-seven years of age, and being himself seventy-seven
years old.</p>
<p>'So after spending seven years there he married two daughters of his uncle
Laban, Leah and Rachel, when he was eighty-four years old: and in seven years
more there were born to him twelve sons; in the eighth year and tenth month
Reuben, and in the ninth year and eighth month Symeon, and in the tenth year and
sixth month Levi, and in the eleventh year and fourth month Judah. And as Rachel
did not bear she became envious of her sister, and gave her own handmaid Zilpah
to be Jacob's concubine, at which same time Bilhah conceived Nephthalim, in the
eleventh year and fifth month, and bare a son in the twelfth year and second
month, and Leah called him Gad: and of the same mother in the same year and
twelfth month he begat another son, who was also named by Leah Asher.</p>
<p>'And in return for the mandrake apples, which Reuben brought ia and gave to
Rachel, Leah again conceived in her womb, and her handmaid Zilpah at the same
time, in the twelfth year and third month, and bare a son in the same year and
twelfth month, and called his name Issachar.</p>
<p>'And again Leah bare another son in the thirteenth year and tenth month, and
his name was Zabulon; and the same Leah bare a son named Dan in the fourteenth
year and eighth month. And at the same time when Leah bare a daughter Dinah,
Rachel also conceived in her womb, and in the fourteenth year and eighth month
bare a son, who was named Joseph, so that in the seven years spent with Laban
there were born twelve children.</p>
<p>'But when Jacob wished to go back to his father in Canaan, he was requested
by Laban to stay six years more, so that in all he abode twenty years with Laban
in Charran.</p>
<p>'And when he was on his way to Canaan an Angel of the Lord wrestled with him,
and touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, and he was benumbed and went lame:
wherefore the sinew on the thigh of cattle is not eaten. And the Angel said to
him, that henceforth he should no longer be called Jacob but Israel.</p>
<p>'And he came to another city of the land of Canaan called Sikima, having with
him his children, Reuben twelve years and two months old, Symeon eleven years
and four months, Levi ten years and six months, Judah nine years and eight
months, Nephthalim eight years and ten months, Gad eight years and ten months,
Asher eight years, Issachar eight years, Zabulon seven years and two months,
Dinah six years and four months, Joseph six years and four months.</p>
<p>'Now Israel dwelt beside Emmor ten years; and Israel's daughter Dinah was
defiled by Sychem the son of Emmor, she being sixteen years and four months old.
And Israel's sons Symeon being twenty-one years and four months old, and Levi
twenty years and six months, rushed forth and slew both Emmor and his son
Sychem, and all their males, because of the defilement of Dinah: and at that
time Jacob was a hundred and seven years old.</p>
<p>'So when he was come to Luz of Bethel, God said that his name was no longer
to be Jacob but Israel. Thence he came to Chaphratha, and thence journeyed to
Ephratha, which is Bethlehem, and begat there a son Benjamin; and Rachel died
after giving birth to Benjamin, when Jacob had lived with her twenty-three
years.</p>
<p>'Thence Jacob came to Mambri of Hebron, to his father Isaac. Now Joseph was
at that time seventeen years old, and he was sold into Egypt, and had remained
in the prison thirteen years, so that he was then thirty years old; and Jacob
was a hundred and ten years old, one year before which time Isaac died, being a
hundred and eighty years old.</p>
<p>'And Joseph having interpreted the king's dreams, governed Egypt seven years,
in which time he married Aseneth daughter of Pentephres the priest of
Heliopolis, and begat Manasseh and Ephraim: and then there followed two years of
the famine.</p>
<p>'But though Joseph had prospered for nine years, he did not send to his
father, because he was a shepherd, as were Joseph's brethren: and with the
Egyptians it is disgraceful to be a shepherd. And that this was the reason why
he did not send for him, Joseph himself declares. For when his kindred came, he
told them that, if they should be summoned by the king and asked what was their
occupation, they should say that they were breeders of cattle.</p>
<p>'And at the dinner they could not understand why in the world Joseph gave
Benjamin a portion five times as much as theirs, as it was not possible for him
to consume so much flesh. He had done this because his father had had seven sons
by Leah, and two by his mother Rachel: therefore he set five portions before
Benjamin, and himself took two; so they had seven portions, as many as the sons
of Leah received.</p>
<p>'In like manner also while giving to each two changes of raiment, to Benjamin
he gave five, and thirty pieces of gold, and sent to his father in the same
proportion, so that his mother's house might be equal to the other.</p>
<p>'Now from the time when Abraham was chosen from among the Gentiles and
migrated into Canaan they had dwelt in that land, Abraham twenty-five years,
Isaac sixty years, Jacob a hundred and thirty years; so that all the years in
Canaan were two hundred and fifteen.</p>
<p><i>'</i>And in the third year of the famine in Egypt, Jacob came into Egypt,
being a hundred and thirty years old, Reuben forty-five years, Symeon
forty-four, Levi forty-three, Judah forty-two years and three months, Asher
forty years and eight months, Nephthalim forty-one years and seven months, Gad
forty-one years and three months, Zabulon forty years, Dinah thirty-nine years,
Benjamin twenty-eight years.</p>
<p>'Joseph, it is said, was in Egypt thirty-nine years; and from Adam until
Joseph's brethren came into Egypt there were three thousand six hundred and
twenty-four years; and from the Deluge until Jacob's coming into Egypt one
thousand three hundred and sixty years; and from the choice of Abraham from
among the Gentiles and his coming from Charran into Canaan until Jacob and his
family came into Egypt two hundred and fifteen years.</p>
<p>'But Jacob came from Charran to Laban, when he was eighty years old, and
begat Levi, and Levi was afterwards seventeen years in Egypt from the time of
his coming from Canaan into Egypt, so that he was sixty years old when he begat
Clath; and in the same year in which Clath was born Jacob died in Egypt, after
he had blessed the sons of Joseph, being himself one hundred and forty-seven
years old and leaving Joseph fifty-six years old. And Levi was a hundred and
thirty-seven years old when he died; and when Clath was forty years old he begat
Amram, who was fourteen years old when Joseph died in Egypt being a hundred and
ten years old: and Clath was a hundred and thirty-three years old when he died.
Amram took to wife his uncle's daughter Jochabet, and when he was seventy-five
years old begat Aaron and Moses; but when he begat Moses Amram was seventy-eight
years old, and Amram was a hundred and thirty-six years old when he died.'</p>
<p>These statements I quote from the work of Alexander Polyhistor. Next let me
add the following:</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII</p>
<p>[THEODOTUS] <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> 'Now Theodotus says in his work <i>Concerning
the Jews </i>that Sikima took its name from Sikimius son of Emmor; for he was
also the founder of the city: and in his book <i>Concerning the Jews </i>he
describes its situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Rich was the land, well-watered, browsed by goats,&nbsp;<br>
          Nor far from field to city was the road.&nbsp;<br>
          No leafy copse the weary wanderer found:&nbsp;<br>
          Yet from it two strong mountains close at hand,&nbsp;<br>
          With grass and forest trees abounding, rise.&nbsp;<br>
          Midway a narrow path runs up the vale,&nbsp;<br>
          Beneath whose farther slope the sacred town&nbsp;<br>
          Of Sikima mid sparkling streams is seen&nbsp;<br>
          Deep down the mountain's side, around whose base&nbsp;<br>
          E'en from the summit runs the well-built wall.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Afterwards, he says, it was subdued by the Hebrews, when Emmor was the
ruler: for Emmor begat a son Sychem. Thus he speaks:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Thence Jacob from the wandering shepherd-life&nbsp;<br>
          Sought Shechem's spacious streets, where o'er his tribe&nbsp;<br>
          Emmor with Sychem ruled, a stubborn pair.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then concerning Jacob and his arrival in Mesopotamia, and the marriage of
his two wives, and the birth of his children, and his coming from Mesopotamia to
Shechem, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;To Syria rich in cattle Jacob came&nbsp;<br>
          From broad Euphrates' loud-resounding stream,&nbsp;<br>
          To shun his twin-born brother's bitter wrath.&nbsp;<br>
          Him Laban gladly welcomed to his home,<br>
          Laban his mother's brother, who alone&nbsp;<br>
          O'er Syria ruled, his sons as yet new-born.&nbsp;<br>
          He then his youngest daughter for a wife&nbsp;<br>
          To Jacob promised, but was loth to give.&nbsp;<br>
          Contriving thus a crafty wile, he sends&nbsp;<br>
          Leah, the elder, to the marriage-bed.&nbsp;<br>
          Such fraud could not escape the husband's eye,&nbsp;<br>
          But for the other daughter seven more years&nbsp;<br>
          He served, and both his cousins took to wife.&nbsp;<br>
          Eleven sons he gat both wise and brave,&nbsp;<br>
          And one fair daughter, Dinah, whose bright face&nbsp;<br>
          And faultless form a noble soul expressed.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'From the Euphrates Jacob, it is said, came to Shechem to Emmor; and he
welcomed him, and gave him a part of his country. So Jacob himself was a
landholder, but his sons, eleven in number, were shepherds, and his daughter
Dinah and his wives wrought wool. And Dinah while yet a virgin came to Shechem
when there was a great festival, wishing to see the city: and Sychem the son of
Emmor saw her and loved her, and seized and carried her off to his own home, and
ravished her.</p>
<p>'But afterwards he came with his father to Jacob, to ask her fur his partner
in marriage; but he said he would not give her, until all the inhabitants of
Shechem were circumcised and followed the customs of the Jews: and Emmor said he
would persuade them.</p>
<p>'With regard to the need of their being circumcised, Jacob says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;It is forbidden by our Hebrew laws&nbsp;<br>
          To bring a bridegroom to our daughters' home,&nbsp;<br>
          Save one who boasts to come of kindred race.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then a little lower down about circumcision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;The God, who Abraham from his home had called,&nbsp;<br>
          Bade him from heaven to set the blood-stained seal&nbsp;<br>
          On flesh of every male; and it was done.&nbsp;<br>
          And changeless still the law which God decreed.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'When Emmor therefore was gone into the city, and was exhorting his subjects
to be circumcised, one of Jacob's sons, whose name was Symeon, being unwilling
to bear his sister's disgrace in a politic manner, determined to slay Emmor and
Sychem: and this determination he communicated to his brother Levi, and took him
as an accomplice and set forth to do the deed, alleging an oracle, that God said
He would give ten nations to Abraham's descendants to destroy.</p>
<p>'And this is how Symeon speaks to Levi:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;For well have I remembered God's own word,&nbsp;<br>
          To give ten nations o'er to Abraham's sons.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'But God, it is said, had put this thought into their mind, because the
inhabitants of Shechem were ungodly men. And this is what he says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;The Shechemites who spared no guest that came,&nbsp;<br>
          Nor bad nor good regarded, God would smite.&nbsp;<br>
          No law nor justice in their state was found,&nbsp;<br>
          But all their thoughts were set on deeds of death.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Levi therefore and Symeon came armed into their city, and first killed those
who came in their way, and then murdered both Emmor and Sychem.</p>
<p>'And of their slaying them he speaks thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;So fiercely then on Emmor Symeon rushed,&nbsp;<br>
          And smote his head, and in his left hand seized&nbsp;<br>
          His throat, but quickly left him gasping still,&nbsp;<br>
          For other task appeared. Levi meanwhile&nbsp;<br>
          Seized Sychem, fiercely raging, by the hair&nbsp;<br>
          And dashed with force resistless to the earth:&nbsp;<br>
          Vainly he clasped the victor's knees, who drave&nbsp;<br>
          His keen sword deep twixt neck and shoulder-blade,&nbsp;<br>
          And swiftly from his breast the spirit fled.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'And when the other brethren heard of their deed, they came to their aid, and
sacked the city, and rescuing their sister carried her back with the captives to
their father's abode.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIII</p>
<p>To this let us add what comes next concerning Joseph out of the same work of
Polyhistor:</p>
<p>[ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR] <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> 'Artapanus says, in
his book <i>Concerning the Jews, </i>that Joseph was a descendant of Abraham and
son of Jacob: and because he surpassed his brethren in understanding and wisdom,
they plotted against him. But he became aware of their conspiracy, and besought
the neighbouring Arabs to convey him across to Egypt: and they did what he
requested; for the kings of the Arabians are offshoots of Israel, being sons of
Abraham, and brethren of Isaac. And when he had come to Egypt and been commended
to the king, he was made administrator of the whole country. And whereas the
Egyptians previously occupied the laud in an irregular way, because the country
was not divided, and the weaker were unjustly treated by the stronger, he was
the first to divide the land, and mark it out with boundaries, and much that lay
waste he rendered fit for tillage, and allotted certain of the arable lands to
the priests.</p>
<p>'He was also the inventor of measures, and for these things he was greatly
beloved by the Egyptians. He married Aseneth a daughter of the priest of
Heliopolis, by whom he begat sons. And afterwards his father and his brethren
came to him, bringing much substance, and were set to dwell in Heliopolis and
Sais, and the Syrians multiplied in Egypt.</p>
<p>'These he says built both the temple in Athos and that in Ileliopolis, and
were called Ermiuth. Soon afterwards Joseph died, as did also the king of Egypt.
So Joseph while governor of Egypt stored up the corn of the seven years, which
had been immensely productive, and became master of Egypt.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIV</p>
<p>'PHILO also, in his fourteenth book <i>Concerning Jerusalem, </i>testifies to
the truth of the sacred Scriptures, speaking as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;For them the mighty lord of all the land&nbsp;<br>
          A happy home prepared----he, now most high,<br>
          Who from the ancient stock of Abraham<br>
          And Isaac sprang, and Jacob rich in sons<br>
          Claimed as his sire----Joseph of royal dreams<br>
          The wise interpreter, who seated high<br>
          On Egypt's throne now sways the sceptre's power,<br>
          Much tossed erewhile by waves of fickle fate:&quot;&nbsp; <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth. So much concerning Joseph.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXV</p>
<p>BUT hear also what the same author tells concerning Job:</p>
<p>'Aristeas says, in his book <i>Concerning the Jews, </i>that Esau married
Bassara in Edom and begat Job. This man dwelt in the land of Uz, on the borders
of Idumaea and Arabia.</p>
<p>'He was a just man, and rich in cattle; for he had acquired &quot;seven
thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five
hundred she-asses at pasture&quot;; <A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> and he had
also much arable land.</p>
<p>'Now this Job was formerly called Jobab: and God continually tried him, and
invoked him in great misfortunes. For first his asses and oxen were driven off
by robbers; then the sheep together with their shepherds were burned up by fire
which fell from heaven, and not long after the camels also were driven off by
robbers; then his children died, from the house falling upon them; and the same
day his own body also was covered with ulcers.</p>
<p>'And while he was in evil case, there came to visit him Eliphaz the king of
the Temanites, and Bildad the tyrant of the Shuhites, and Zophar the king of the
Minnaei, and there came also Elihu the son of Barachiel the Zobite.</p>
<p>'But when they tried to exhort him, he said that even without exhortation he
should continue steadfast in piety even in his sufferings. And God being pleased
with his good courage, relieved him from his disease, and made him master of
great possessions.'</p>
<p>So much says Polyhistor on this subject.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXVI</p>
<p>AND concerning Moses the same author again brings forward many things, which
are worth hearing:</p>
<p>[ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR] 'But Eupolemus says that the first wise man was Moses,
and that he was the first to teach the Jews letters, and from the Jews the
Phoenicians received them, and from the Phoenicians the Greeks, and that Moses
was the first to give written laws to the Jews.' <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A></p>
<p>CHAPTER XXVII</p>
<p>'AND Artapanus says, in his book <i>Concerning the Jews, </i>that after the
death of Abraham, and of his son Mempsasthenoth, and likewise of the king of
Egypt, his son Palmanothes succeeded to the sovereignty.</p>
<p>'This king behaved badly to the Jews; and first he built Kessa, and founded
the temple therein, and then built the temple in Heliopolis.</p>
<p>'He begat a daughter Merris, whom he betrothed to a certain Chenephres, king
of the regions above Memphis (for there were at that time many kings in Egypt);
and she being barren took a supposititious child from one of the Jews, and
called him Mouses (Moses): but by the Greeks he was called, when grown to
manhood, Musaeus.</p>
<p>'And this Moses, they said, was the teacher of Orpheus; and when grown up he
taught mankind many useful things. For he was the inventor of ships, and
machines for laying stones, and Egyptian arms, and engines for drawing water and
for war, and invented philosophy. Further he divided the State into thirty-six
Nomes, and. appointed the god to be worshipped by each Nome, and the sacred
writing for the priests, and their gods were cats, and dogs, and ibises: he also
apportioned an especial district for the priests.</p>
<p>'All these things he did for the sake of keeping the sovereignty firm and
safe for Chenepbres. For previously the multitudes, being under no order, now
expelled and now set up kings, often the same persons, but sometimes others.</p>
<p>'For these reasons then Moses was beloved by the multitudes, and being deemed
by the priests worthy to be honoured like a god, was named Hermes, because of
his interpretation of the Hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>'But when Chenephres perceived the excellence of Moses he envied him, and
sought to slay him on some plausible pretext. And so when the Aethiopians
invaded Egypt, Chenephres supposed that he had found a convenient opportunity,
and sent Moses in command of a force against them, and enrolled the body of
husbandmen for him, supposing that through the weakness of his troops he would
easily be destroyed by the enemy.</p>
<p>'But Moses with about a hundred thousand of the husbandmen came to the
so-called Nome of Hermopolis, and there encamped; and sent generals to
pre-occupy the country, who gained remarkable successes in their battles. He
adds that the people of Heliopolis say that this war went on for ten years.</p>
<p>'So Moses, because of the greatness of his army, built a city in this place,
and therein consecrated the ibis, because this bird kills the animals that are
noxious to man. And he called it Hermes' city.</p>
<p>'Thus then the Aethiopians, though they were enemies, became so fond of
Moses, that they even learned from him the custom of circumcision: and not they
only, but also all the priests.</p>
<p>'But when the war was ended, Chenephres pretended to welcome him, while in
reality continuing to plot against him. So he took his troops from him, and sent
some to the frontiers of Aethiopia for an advanced guard; and ordered others to
demolish the temple in Diospolis which had been built of baked brick, and build
another of stone from the quarries of the neighbouring mountain, and appointed
Nacheros superintendent of the building.</p>
<p>'And when he was come with Moses to Memphis, he asked him whether there was
anything else useful for mankind, and he said the breed of oxen, because by
means of them the land is ploughed: and Chenephres having given the name Apis to
a bull, commanded the troops to found a temple for him, and bade them bring and
bury there the animals which had been consecrated by Moses, because he wished to
bury the inventions of Moses in oblivion. 'But when the Egyptians were alienated
from him, he bound his friends by an oath not to report to Moses the plot which
was being contrived against him, and he appointed the men who were to kill him.</p>
<p>'When however no one would obey him, Chenephres reproached Chanethothes, whom
he had especially addressed; and he, on being thus reproached, promised to make
the attempt when he found an opportunity.</p>
<p>'And Merris having died about this time, Chenephres professed to give the
body to Moses and Chanethothes to carry it over into regions beyond Egypt and
bury it, supposing that Moses would be slain by Chanethothes.</p>
<p>'But while they were on the way, one of those who were cognizant of the plot
reported it to Moses; and he being on his guard buried Merris himself, and
called the river and the city thereby Meroe. And this Merris is honoured by the
people of the country not less highly than Isis.</p>
<p>'Then Aaron the brother of Moses, having learned about the plot, advised his
brother to flee into Arabia; and he took the advice, and sailed across the Nile
from Memphis, intending to escape into Arabia.</p>
<p>'But when Chanethothes was informed of the flight of Moses, he lay in ambush
intending to kill him; and when he saw him coming, he drew his sword against
him, but Moses was too quick for him, and seized his hand, and drew his sword
and slew Chanethothes.</p>
<p>'So he made his escape into Arabia, and lived with Raguel the ruler of the
district, having married his daughter. And Raguel wished to make an expedition
against the Egyptians in order to restore Moses, and procure the government for
his daughter and son-in-law; but Moses prevented it, out of regard for his own
nation: and Raguel forbidding him to march against the Arabs, ordered him to
plunder Egypt.</p>
<p>'About the same time Chenephres died, having been the very first person
attacked by elephantiasis; and he is said to have incurred this misfortune
because he ordered the Jews to wear linen garments and not to wear woollen
clothing, in order that they might be conspicuous, and be punished by him.</p>
<p>'But Moses prayed to God now at last to put an end to the sufferings of the
tribes. And God being propitiated, fire, it is said, suddenly blazed up out of
the earth, and went on burning though there was no wood nor any other fuel in
the place. And Moses was frightened at the occurrence and took to flight; but a
divine voice spake to him, to march against Egypt, and rescue the Jews and lead
them into their old country.</p>
<p>'So he took courage and determined to lead a hostile force against the
Egyptians: but first he came to his brother Aaron. And when the king of Egypt
heard of the arrival of Moses, he called him before him, and asked what he had
come for: and he said, Because the Lord of the world commanded him to deliver
the Jews.</p>
<p>'And when the king heard this, he shut him up in prison. But when it was
night, all the doors of the prison-house opened of their own accord, and of the
guards some died, and some were sunk in sleep, and their weapons broken in
pieces.</p>
<p>'So Moses passed out and came to the palace; and finding the doors opened he
went in, and the guards here also being sunk in sleep he woke up the king. And
he being dismayed at what had happened bade Moses tell him the name of the God
who sent him, scoffing at him: but Moses bent down and whispered in his ear, and
when the king heard it he fell speechless, but was held fast by Moses and came
to life again.</p>
<p>'And he wrote the name in a tablet and sealed it up; and one of the priests
who made light of what was written in the tablet was seized with a convulsion
and died.</p>
<p>'Also the king told him to work some sign for him, and Moses threw down the
rod which he held and turned it into a serpent; and when they were all
frightened, he seized it by the tail and took it up, and made it a rod again.</p>
<p>'Then he went forth a little, and smote the Nile with the rod, and the river
became flooded and deluged the whole of Egypt, and it was from that time its
inundation began: and the water became stagnant, and stank, and killed all
living things in the river, and the people were perishing of thirst.</p>
<p>'But when these wonders had been wrought, the king said that after a month he
would let the people go, if Moses would restore the river to its proper state;
and he smote the water again with his rod, and checked the stream.</p>
<p>'When this was done, the king summoned the priests from above Memphis, and
said that he would kill them all, and demolish the temples, unless they also
would work some wonder. And then they by some witchcraft and incantations made a
serpent, and changed the colour of the river.</p>
<p>'And the king, being puffed up with pride at what was done, began to maltreat
the Jews with every kind of vengeance and punishment. Then Moses, seeing this,
both wrought other signs, and also smote the earth with his rod, and brought up
a kind of winged animal to harass the Egyptians, and all their bodies broke out
in boils. And as the physicians were unable to heal the sufferers, the Jews thus
again gained relief.</p>
<p>'Again Moses by his rod brought up frogs, and besides them locusts and lice.
And for this reason the Egyptians dedicate the rod in every temple, and to Isis
likewise, because the earth is Isis, and sent up these wonders when smitten by
the rod.</p>
<p>'But as the king still persisted in his folly, Moses caused hail and
earthquakes by night, so that those who fled from the earthquake were killed by
the hail, and those who sought shelter from the hail were destroyed by the
earthquakes. And at that time all the houses fell in, and most of the temples.</p>
<p>'At last after having incurred such calamities the king let the Jews go: and
they, after borrowing from the Egyptians many drinking-vessels, and no little
raiment, and very much other treasure, crossed the rivers on the Arabian side,
and after traversing a wide space came on the third day to the Red Sea.</p>
<p>'Now the people of Memphis say, that Moses being acquainted with the country
waited for the ebb, and took the people across the sea when dry. But the people
of Heliopolis say, that the king hastened after them with a great force, having
also with him the consecrated animals, because the Jews were carrying off the
property which they had borrowed from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>'There came, however, to Moses a divine voice bidding him to smite the sea
with the rod [and that it should divide]: and when Moses heard it, he touched
the water with the rod, and so the stream divided, and the force passed over by
a dry path.</p>
<p>'But when the Egyptians went in with them and were pursuing them, a fire, it
is said, shone out upon them from the front, and the sea overflowed the path
again, and the Egyptians were all destroyed by the fire and the flood: but the
Jews having escaped this danger spent forty years in the wilderness, God raining
down meal for them like millet, similar in colour to snow. And Moses they say
was tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified: and he performed these
deeds when he was about eighty-nine years old.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXVIII</p>
<p>'WITH regard to Moses being exposed by his mother in the marsh, and taken up
and reared by the king's daughter, Ezekiel the tragic poet gives an account,
taking up the narrative from the beginning when Jacob and his family came into
Egypt to Joseph. And he tells it as follows, bringing Moses forward as the
speaker: <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;When Jacob from the land of Canaan down&nbsp;<br>
          To Egypt came, with threescore souls and ten,&nbsp;<br>
          He there begat a multitudinous race,&nbsp;<br>
          Who much endured and long, by wicked men&nbsp;<br>
          And tyrant's hand to this our day crushed down.&nbsp;<br>
          For when he saw our people had waxed strong,&nbsp;<br>
          The king with subtle craft our fathers ruled,&nbsp;<br>
          And some in making bricks ho sore oppressed,&nbsp;<br>
          And some in raising heavy stones to build&nbsp;<br>
          His lofty towers, for their despite contrived.&nbsp;<br>
          Next he commands that all the Hebrew race&nbsp;<br>
          Cast every man-child in the Nile's deep flood.&nbsp;<br>
          And I have often heard my mother tell,&nbsp;<br>
          How at that time she hid me for three months:&nbsp;<br>
          Fearing detection then, she wrapped me close&nbsp;<br>
          In rough attire, and laid me secretly&nbsp;<br>
          'Mid the thick rushes by the river's bank.&nbsp;<br>
          My sister Miriam close at hand kept watch,&nbsp;<br>
          Till Pharaoh's daughter with her maids came down&nbsp;<br>
          To bathe her shining limbs in the cool stream.&nbsp;<br>
          She saw the babe, and straightway took it up,<br>
          And knew its Hebrew birth. My sister then&nbsp;<br>
          Ran up, and to the princess thus she spake:&nbsp;<br>
          'Wilt thou I find as nurse for this fair child&nbsp;<br>
          Some Hebrew wife?' The princess bade her speed,&nbsp;<br>
          And to her mother quick she told the tale,&nbsp;<br>
          Who came with speed, and took me in her arms.&nbsp;<br>
          Then spake the Pharaoh's daughter, 'Take this child&nbsp;<br>
          To nurse, good dame, and I will pay thy wage.'&nbsp;<br>
          'Moses' the name she gave, to mark the fact&nbsp;<br>
          That from the river's brink she drew me forth.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'To this farther on in the tragedy Ezekiel adds more on the following points,
bringing Moses forward as speaking:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;So when my time of infancy was past,&nbsp;<br>
          My mother led me to the princess' home,&nbsp;<br>
          But first she told me all the tale, my birth&nbsp;<br>
          And kindred, and God's gifts of old.&nbsp;<br>
          The princess then through all my boyhood's years,&nbsp;<br>
          As I had been a son of her own womb,&nbsp;<br>
          In royal state and learning nurtured me.&nbsp;<br>
          But when the circle of the days was full,&nbsp;<br>
          I left the palace, urged to lofty deeds&nbsp;<br>
          By my own soul, and by the king's device.&nbsp;<br>
          Then the first day I saw two men at strife,&nbsp;<br>
          Egyptian one, and one of Hebrew race.&nbsp;<br>
          And when I saw that we were quite alone,&nbsp;<br>
          None else in sight, I to the rescue came,&nbsp;<br>
          Avenged my kinsman, and the Egyptian slew,&nbsp;<br>
          And buried in the sand, that none might see&nbsp;<br>
          What we had ventured, and lay bare the deed.&nbsp;<br>
          But on the morrow's dawn again I saw&nbsp;<br>
          Two of our kin in deadly strife, and cried,&nbsp;<br>
          'Why smitest thou thy weaker brother thus?'&nbsp;<br>
          But he replied, 'And who made thee a judge,&nbsp;<br>
          Or ruler here? Me also wouldest thou slay,&nbsp;<br>
          As that man yestermorn?' Then to myself&nbsp;<br>
          In fear I said, 'How came that deed abroad?'&nbsp;<br>
          All this was quickly carried to the king.&nbsp;<br>
          And Pharaoh sought to take away my life.&nbsp;<br>
          His plot I learned, and from his hands escaped,&nbsp;<br>
          And now to other lands am wandering forth.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then, concerning the daughters of Raguel he adds this:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;But here, behold! some seven fair maids I see.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'And on his asking them what maidens they were, Zipporah replies:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;The land, O stranger, bears the common name&nbsp;<br>
          Of Libya, but by various tribes is held&nbsp;<br>
          Of dark-skinned Aethiops: yet the land is ruled&nbsp;<br>
          By one sole monarch, and sole chief in war.&nbsp;<br>
          This city has for ruler and for judge&nbsp;<br>
          A priest, the father of myself and these.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'He then describes the giving drink to the cattle, and adds the account of
his marriage with Zipporah, bringing forward Chum and Zipporah as speaking in
alternate verses:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i>&quot;Ch. </i>'Yet this thou need'st must tell me,
          Zipporah.'&nbsp;<br>
          <i>Z. </i>'My father gave me for this stranger's wife.'&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CHAPTER XXIX</p>
<p>'DEMETRIUS described the slaying of the Egyptian, and the quarrel with him
who gave information about the deceased man, in the same way as the writer of
the Sacred Book. He says, however, that Moses fled into Midian, and there
married Zipporah the daughter of Jothor, who was, as far as one may conjecture
from the names, one of the descendants of Keturah, of the stock of Abraham, from
Jexan who was the son of Abraham by Keturah: and from Jexan was born Dadan, and
from Dadan Raguel, and from Raguel, Jothor, and Hobab: and from Jothor Zipporah,
whom Moses married.</p>
<p>'The generations also agree; for Moses was seventh from Abraham, and Zipporah
sixth. For Isaac, from whom Moses descended, was already married when Abraham at
the age of a hundred and forty married Keturah, and begat by her a second son
Isaar. Now he begat Isaac when he was a hundred years old; so that Isaar, from
whom Zipporah derived her descent, was born forty-two years later than Isaac.</p>
<p>'There is therefore no inconsistency in Moses and Zipporah having lived at
the same time. And they dwelt in the city Madiam, which was called from one of
the sons of Abraham. For it says that Abraham sent his sons towards the East to
find a dwelling-place: for this reason also Aaron and Miriam said at Hazeroth
that Moses had married an Aethiopian woman.</p>
<p>'Ezekiel also speaks of this in the <i>Exodus, </i>adding to the tradition
the dream that was seen by Moses and interpreted by his father-in-law. And Moses
himself talks with his father-in-law in alternate verses, as follows:&nbsp; <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Methought upon Mount Sinai's brow I saw&nbsp;<br>
          A mighty throne that reached to heaven's high vault,&nbsp;<br>
          Whereon there sat a man of noblest mien&nbsp;<br>
          Wearing a royal crown; whose left hand held&nbsp;<br>
          A mighty sceptre; and his right to me&nbsp;<br>
          Made sign, and I stood forth before the throne.&nbsp;<br>
          He gave me then the sceptre and the crown,&nbsp;<br>
          And bade me sit upon the royal throne,&nbsp;<br>
          From which himself removed. Thence I looked forth&nbsp;<br>
          Upon the earth's wide circle, and beneath&nbsp;<br>
          The earth itself, and high above the heaven.&nbsp;<br>
          Then at my feet, behold! a thousand stars&nbsp;<br>
          Began to fall, and I their number told,&nbsp;<br>
          As they passed by me like an armed host:&nbsp;<br>
          And I in terror started up from sleep.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then his father-in-law thus interprets the dream:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;This sign from God bodes good to thee, my friend.&nbsp;<br>
          Would I might live to see thy lot fulfilled!&nbsp;<br>
          A mighty throne shalt thou set up, and be&nbsp;<br>
          Thyself the leader and the judge of men!&nbsp;<br>
          And as o'er all the peopled earth thine eye&nbsp;<br>
          Looked forth, and underneath the earth, and high&nbsp;<br>
          Above God's heaven; so shall thy mind survey&nbsp;<br>
          All things in time, past, present, and to come.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'With regard to the burning bush, and the mission of Moses to Pharaoh, he
again brings Moses forward as holding converse alternately with God. Moses
speaks thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Ha! see! What sign is this from yonder bush?&nbsp;<br>
          A marvel such as no man might believe.&nbsp;<br>
          A sudden mighty fire flames round the bush,&nbsp;<br>
          And yet its growth remains all green and fresh.&nbsp;<br>
          What then? I will go forward, and behold&nbsp;<br>
          This wondrous sign, that passes man's belief.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then God speaks to him:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Stay, Moses, faithful servant, draw not nigh,&nbsp;<br>
          Ere thou hast loosed thy shoes from off thy feet:&nbsp;<br>
          The place thou standest on is holy ground;&nbsp;<br>
          And from this bush God's word shines forth for thee.&nbsp;<br>
          Fear not, My son, but hearken to My words.&nbsp;<br>
          Of mortal birth, thou canst not see My face;&nbsp;<br>
          Yet mayest thou hear the words I came to speak.<br>
          Thy fathers' God, the God of Abraham,<br>
          Of Isaac, and of Jacob, I am God.<br>
          I do remember all My gifts to them,<br>
          And come to save My people Israel;<br>
          For I have seen their sorrows and their toils.<br>
          Go then, and signify thou in My name,<br>
          First to the Hebrews gathered by themselves,<br>
          Then to the king of Egypt, this My will,<br>
          That thou lead forth My people from the land.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then lower down Moses himself speaks some lines in answer:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;I am not eloquent, O Lord, but slow&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Of speech my tongue, and weak my stammering voice&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          To utter words of mine before the king?&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then God in answer to this says to him:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Thy brother Aaron I will send with speed:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          First tell thou him all I have told to thee;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And he before the king, and thou with&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Me Alone shalt speak, he what he hears from thee.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'With regard to the rod, and the other wonders thus he speaks in alternate
verse:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<i>God. </i>'Say, what is that thou holdest in thine hand?
          '&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <i>M. </i>'A rod, wherewith to smite or beasts or men.'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <i>God. </i>'Cast it upon the ground, and flee in haste;&nbsp;<br>
          For a fierce serpent will affright thine eye.'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <i>N. </i>'Lo! there I cast it. Save me, gracious Lord!<br>
          How huge, how fierce! In pity spare Thou me.<br>
          I shudder at the sight in every limb.'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <i>God. </i>'Fear not: stretch forth thy hand, and seize the tail.<br>
          Again 'twill be a rod. Now thrust thy hand<br>
          Into thy bosom: take it out again.<br>
          See, at My word, 'tis leprous, white as snow.<br>
          Now thrust it in again, 'tis as before.' &quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To this, after some words that he has interposed, he adds the following:</p>
<p>'Now this is what Ezekiel says in <i>The Exodus, </i>when he brings forward
God speaking of the signs, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;With this thy rod thou shalt work all these plagues.&nbsp;<br>
          The river first shall flow all red with blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And every spring, and stream, and stagnant pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Then frogs and lice shall swarm o'er all the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Next ashes from the furnace sprinkled round&nbsp;<br>
          In ulcers sore shall burst on man and beast.<br>
          And swarms of flies shall come, and sore afflict<br>
          The bodies of the Egyptians. After that<br>
          On those hard hearts the pestilence and death<br>
          Shall fall. And heaven's wrath let loose on high<br>
          Shall pour down fire and hail and deadly storm<br>
          On man, and beast, and all the fruits of earth.<br>
          Then shall be darkness over all the land<br>
          For three whole days, and locusts shall devour<br>
          All food, all fruits, and every blade of grass.<br>
          Moreover I will slay each first-born child,<br>
          And crush this evil nation's wanton pride.<br>
          Yet none of these My plagues shall touch the king,<br>
          Until he see his first-born son lie dead:<br>
          Then will he send you forth in fear and haste.<br>
          This also speak to all the Hebrew race:<br>
          'This month shall be the first month of your year,<br>
          Wherein I bring you to that other land,<br>
          As to the fathers of your race I sware.'<br>
          Also command the people, in this month,<br>
          At evening ere the moon's full orb appear,<br>
          To sacrifice the Passover to God,<br>
          And strike the side-posts of the door with blood:<br>
          So shall My messenger of death pass by.<br>
          But the flesh eat ye roast with fire at night.<br>
          Then will the king drive forth your gathered host<br>
          In haste; but ere ye go, I will give grace<br>
          To this My people in the Egyptians' eyes,<br>
          So that each woman from her neighbour's store<br>
          All needful vessels freely shall receive,<br>
          Silver and gold, and raiment meet for man,<br>
          To make requital for their evil deeds.<br>
          And when ye shall have reached your promised land,<br>
          Take heed that, from the morn whereon ye fled<br>
          From Egypt and marched onward seven whole days,<br>
          From that same morn so many days each year<br>
          Ye eat unleavened bread, and serve your God,<br>
          Offering the first-born of all living things,<br>
          All males that open first the mother's womb.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'And again concerning this same feast he says that the poet has spoken with
more careful elaboration:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;And when the tenth day of this month is come,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Let every Hebrew for his household choose&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Unblemished lambs and calves, and keep them up&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Until the fourteenth day; and then at eve&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Offer the solemn sacrifice, and eat&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The flesh and inward parts all roast with fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Thus shall ye eat it, with your loins girt up,<br>
          And shoes upon your feet, a staff withal<br>
          Held ready in your hand; for in great haste<br>
          The king will bid them drive you from his land.<br>
          Let each man's eating for the lamb make count;<br>
          And when the victim has been duly slain,<br>
          Take a full bunch of hyssop in your hand,<br>
          Dipped in the sacred blood, and therewith strike<br>
          The posts and upper lintel of the door;<br>
          That death may pass o'er every Hebrew's house.<br>
          Keep ever thus this feast unto the Lord,<br>
          Eating for seven days unleavened bread,<br>
          And in your houses let no leaven be found.<br>
          For ye shall be delivered, and the Lord<br>
          Shall lead you forth from Egypt in this month,<br>
          Henceforth to be tho first month of your year.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, after some other passages he further says:</p>
<p>'Ezekiel also, in the drama which is entitled <i>The Exodus, </i>brings
forward a Messenger describing both the condition of the Hebrews and the
destruction of the Egyptians, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;For when king Pharaoh from his house set forth&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          With all this crowd of countless men-at-arms,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          With horsemen, and with four-horsed chariots,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          In serried ranks in front and on each flank,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The embattled host was dreadful to behold.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The centre footmen held in phalanx deep&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          With spaces for the chariots to drive through.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And on the right wing and the left were set&nbsp;<br>
          The best of all the Egyptian chivalry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The numbers of our army which I asked,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Were thousand thousands brave well-armed men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The Hebrews, when o'ertaken by our host,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Lay some in groups hard by the Red Sea shore&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Worn out with toil, and others with their wives&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          To feed their tender infants were intent:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Cumbered with flocks and herds and household goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The men themselves with hands not armed for fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          At sight of us, set up a doleful cry,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And all, with hands uplift to heaven, invoked&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Their fathers' God. Great was their multitude;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          But on our side all jubilant our camp&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Behind them close we pitched, where by the sea&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          There lies a city, Baal-zephon hight.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And as the sun was near his western couch,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          We waited, longing for the fight at dawn,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Trusting our mighty host and deadly arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          But now the signs of heaven's own wrath began,<br>
          A dread and wondrous sight. For suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          A pillar of cloud rose high above the earth&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Midway between the Hebrew camp and ours:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And then their leader Moses took his rod&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Of power divine, which late on Egypt wrought&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          So many baneful signs and prodigies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Therewith he struck the waves, and the deep sea&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Was cleft asunder; and with eager steps&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Their host rushed swiftly o'er that briny path.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          We then upon their track without delay&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Trod the same path, and marching forward met&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The darkness of the night; when suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          As if fast bound in chains, our chariot wheels<br>
          Refused to turn; and from the sky a flame&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          As of a mighty fire before us shone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Their God, methinks, was there to succour them:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          For they no sooner reached the farther shore,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Than close at hand we heard the mighty roar&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Of surging waves; and one in terror cried:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          'Flee from the vengeful hand of the Most High,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          For it is He that helps our enemies,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And works for our destruction.' Then the sea<br>
          Surged o'er our path, and overwhelmed our host.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And again soon after:</p>
<p>'Thence they went forward three days, as Demetrius himself says, and the Holy
Scripture agrees with him: but as he found there no sweet water, but bitter, at
God's command he cast the wood of a certain tree into the fountain, and the
water became sweet. And thence they came to Elim, and found there twelve springs
of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees. As to these, and the bird which
appeared there, Ezekiel in <i>The Exodus </i>introduces some one who speaks to
Moses concerning the palm-trees and the twelve springs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>''See, my lord Moses, what a spot is found&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Fanned by sweet airs from yonder shady grove.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          For as thyself mayest see, there lies the stream,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And thence at night the fiery pillar shed&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Its welcome guiding light. A meadow there&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Beside the stream in grateful shadow lies&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And a deep glen in rich abundance pours&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          From out a single rock twelve sparkling springs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          There tall and strong, and laden all with fruit,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Stand palms threescore and ten; and plenteous grass&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Well watered gives sweet pasture to our flocks.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'Then lower down he gives a full description of the bird that appeared:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Another living thing we saw, more strange&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          And marvellous than man e'er saw before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The noblest eagle scarce was half as large:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          His outspread wings with varying colours shone;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The breast was bright with purple, and the legs&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          With crimson glowed, and on the shapely neck&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The golden plumage shone in graceful curves:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The head was like a gentle nestling's formed:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Bright shone the yellow circlet of the eye&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          On all around, and wondrous sweet the voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          The king he seemed of all the winged tribe,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          As soon was proved; for birds of every kind&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Hovered in fear behind his stately form:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          While like a bull, proud leader of the herd,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          Foremost he marched with swift and haughty step.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And after a few words he adds that:</p>
<p>'Some one asked how the Israelites got weapons, as they came out unarmed. For
they said that after they had gone out a three days' journey, and offered
sacrifice, they would return again. It appears therefore that these who had not
been overwhelmed in the sea made use of the others' arms.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXX</p>
<p>'BUT Eupolemus says, in some comment on the prophecy of Elias, that Moses
prophesied forty years; then Jesus the sou of Nave thirty years, and he lived a
hundred and ten years, and pitched the holy tabernacle in Silo.</p>
<p>'And afterwards Samuel rose up as a prophet: and then by God's -will Saul was
chosen king by Samuel, and died after a reign of twenty-one years.</p>
<p>'Then his son David reigned, who subdued the Syrians which live beside the
river Euphrates, and Commagene, and the Assyrians in Galadene, and the
Phoenicians; he also made expeditions against the Edomites, and Ammonites, and
Moabites, and Ituraeans, and Nabathaeans, and Nabdaeans.</p>
<p>'And again he made an expedition against Suron king of Tyre and Phoenicia;
and compelled these nations to pay tribute to the Jews; and contracted a
friendly alliance with Vaphres king of Egypt.</p>
<p>'And when David wished to build a temple for God, he entreated God to point
out to him a place for the altar; whereupon there appeared to him an angel
standing above the place, where the altar is built in Jerusalem, who commanded
him not to build the temple, because he was defiled with men's blood and had
passed many years in war.</p>
<p>'And the angel's name was Dianathan; and he bade him commit the building of
the temple to his son, but himself to prepare the things pertaining to the
building, gold, silver, brass, stones, cypress wood and cedar.</p>
<p>'And on bearing this David built ships in Aelan a city of Arabia, and sent
miners to the island Drphe which lies in the Red Sea, and contains gold mines.
And thence the miners transported the gold into Judaea.</p>
<p>'When David had reigned forty years he gave over the government to Solomon
his son, who was twelve years old, in the presence of Eli the High Priest and
the twelve princes of the tribes, and delivered to him the gold and silver and
brass and stone and cypress wood and cedar. Then David died, and Solomon was
king, and wrote to Vaphres king of Egypt the letter which is transcribed below.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXI</p>
<p>'&quot;KING SOLOMON TO VAPHRES KING OP EGYPT, HIS FATHER'S FRIEND, GBEETING.</p>
<p>&quot;KNOW thou that I have succeeded to the kingdom of my father David by
the help of the Most High God, who has also enjoined on me to build a temple to
the God who made heaven and earth: and withal to write to thee, to send me some
of thy peoples, who shall stay and help me, until we shall have completed all
things that are required, according to the injunction laid on me.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXII '&quot;KING VAPHRES TO SOLOMON THE GREAT KING GEEETING.</p>
<p>&quot;I REJOICED much when I read thy letter, and both I and all my kingdom
kept a festive day in honour of thy succession, to the throne after a man so
good and approved by so great a God. But as to what thou writest to me
concerning the men among our peoples here, I have sent thee eighty thousand, and
have clearly explained to thee their numbers and the places from which they
come: from the Sebrithitic nome tea thousand, and from the Mendesian and
Sebennytic twenty thousand: from the nomes of Busiris Leonto-polis and
Athribites ten thousand each. And do thou carefully provide what things they
require, and for the rest, that they may be in good order, and may be restored
to their own country, as soon as they cease to be wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXIII</p>
<p>'&quot;KING SOLOMON TO SURON KING OP TYRE AND SIDON AND PHOENICIA, HIS
FATHER'S FRIEND, GREETING.</p>
<p>&quot;KNOW thou that I have received the kingdom from my father David by help
of the Most High God, who also enjoined on me to build a temple to the God who
made the heaven and the earth, and withal to write to thee to send me some men
from thy peoples, who shall stay and help us until we have fulfilled the
requirement of God, according to the injunction laid upon me. I have written
also to Galilee, and Samaria, and the land of Moab, and Ammon, and Gilead, to
supply them with necessaries from the country every month, ten thousand cors of
corn (a cor is six artabae) and ten thousand homers of wine (the homer of wine
is ten measures): and oil and the rest shall be supplied to them from Judaea,
and from Arabia, victims for sacrifice on which to feed.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXIV '&quot;SURON TO SOLOMON THE GREAT KING GREETING.</p>
<p>&quot;BLESSED be God, who made the heaven and the earth, who hath chosen a
worthy son of a worthy father. As soon as I read thy letter I rejoiced greatly,
and gave praise to God for thy succession to the kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;And as to what thou writest concerning the men in our various peoples,
I have sent thee of Tyrians and Phoenicians eighty thousand, and as chief
architect I have sent thee a man of Tyre, of a Jewish mother of the tribe of
David: on whatsoever thou shalt ask him of all things under heaven, relating to
architecture, he will give thee advice, and will carry out the work.</p>
<p>&quot;And with regard to necessary provisions, and to the servants whom I
send to thee, thou wilt do well in commanding the local governors, that all
things necessary he provided.&quot; '</p>
<p>'When Solomon with his father's friends had passed over to mount Lebanon with
the Sidonians and Tyrians, he transported the timber which had previously been
cut by his father to Joppa by sea, and thence by land to Jerusalem. And he began
to build the temple of God when he was thirteen years old: and the work was done
by the nations before-mentioned, and the twelve tribes of the Jews supplied the
hundred and sixty thousand with all things necessary, one tribe each month; and
they laid the foundations of the temple of God, sixty cubits in length, and
sixty cubits in breadth, but the breadth of the building and of the foundations
was ten cubits, for so had Nathan the prophet of God commanded him.</p>
<p>'And they built alternately a course of stone and a beam of cypress-wood,
fastening the two courses together with bronze cramps of a talent in weight. And
when he had built it thus, he boarded it outside with planks of cedar and
cypress, so that the stone building was not visible: and covered the temple with
gold on the inside, by piling up bricks of gold five cubits long, and nailing
them to the walls with silver nails of a talent in weight, four in number, and
shaped like a breast.</p>
<p>'Thus he covered it with gold from floor to roof, and the ceiling he made of
golden panels, and the roof he made of brass, that is of brass tiles, having
smelted brass and poured it into moulds. He made also two columns of brass, and
covered them with pure gold, a finger's breadth in thickness.</p>
<p>'And the columns were as high as the temple, and in size each pillar ten
cubits in circumference: and they stood one on the right side of the house, and
the other on the left. He made also golden lamp-stands, weighing ten talents
each, having taken as a pattern the lamp-stand set by Moses in the tabernacle of
the Testimony.</p>
<p>'And he set them on either side of the shrine, some on the right and some on
the left. He made also seventy golden lamps, so that there might be seven
burning on each lamp-stand. He built also the gates of the temple, and adorned
them with gold and silver, and roofed them over with panels of cedar and
cypress.</p>
<p>'He made a porch also on the north side of the temple, and supported it on
forty-eight pillars of brass. He made also a brazen laver, twenty cubits in
length, and twenty cubits in width, and five cubits high. And upon it he made a
brim projecting on the outside towards the base one cubit, in order that the
priests might stand up on it, and wash their feet and hands. Also he made the
bases of the laver, twelve in number, molten and chased, and of the height of a
man, and set them at the hinder side beneath the laver, on the right side of the
altar.</p>
<p>'He made also a brazen step two cubits high, near the laver, that the king
might stand upon it, when praying, so that he might be seen by the Jewish
people. Also he built the altar of twenty-five cubits by twenty cubits, and
twelve cubits high.</p>
<p>'He made also two brazen rings of chain-work, and set them upon machines
rising twenty cubits in height above the temple, and they cast a shadow over the
whole temple: and to each net-work he hung four hundred brass bells of a talent
in weight, and the net-works he made solid, that the bells might sound, and
frighten away the birds, that they might not settle upon the temple, nor nest
upon the panels of the gates and porches, and defile the temple with their dung.</p>
<p>'He also surrounded the city Jerusalem with walls and towers and moats, and
built a palace for himself.</p>
<p>'And the Lord's house was at first called the Temple of Solomon (<span class="Greek">&#x1F39;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03A3;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>); afterwards by a corruption the city was named Hierusalem
from the Temple, but by the Greeks was called Hierosolyma after the king's name.</p>
<p>'And when he had completed the Temple and the walls of the city, he went to
Shiloh, and offered a thousand oxen for a burnt-offering. And he took the
Tabernacle, and the altar, and the vessels which Moses made, and brought them to
Jerusalem, and put them in the house.</p>
<p>'Moreover the Ark, and the golden altar, and the lamp-stand, and the table,
and the other vessels he deposited there, as the prophet commanded him.</p>
<p>'And he offered to God an immense sacrifice, two thousand sheep, three
thousand five hundred calves. And the whole amount of gold which was expended
upon the two pillars and the temple was four millions six hundred thousand
talents: and upon the nails and the rest of the furniture one thousand two
hundred and thirty-two talents of silver: and of brass for the columns and the
laver and the porch eighteen thousand and fifty talents.</p>
<p>'And Solomon sent away both the Egyptians and the Phoenicians each to their
own country, having given to every man ten shekels of gold; now the shekel is a
talent. And to Vaphres the king of Egypt he sent ten thousand measures of oil, a
thousand measures of dates, a hundred vessels of honey, and spices.</p>
<p>'And to Suron at Tyre he sent the golden pillar which is dedicated in the
temple of Zeus at Tyre.</p>
<p>'But Theophilus says that Solomon sent the gold that remained over to the
king of Tyre; and that he made a life-sized figure as an image of his daughter,
and made the golden column into a covering for the statue.</p>
<p>'And Eupolemus says that Solomon made also a thousand golden shields, each of
which weighed five hundred staters of gold. He lived fifty-two years, of which
he reigned forty in peace.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXV</p>
<p>'TIMOCHARES, in his <i>Life of Antiochus, </i>says that Jerusalem has a
circuit of forty furlongs, and is difficult to take, being shut in on all sides
by abrupt ravines: and that the whole city is flooded with streams of water, so
that even the gardens are irrigated by waters which flow off from the city. But
the country from the city as far as forty furlongs is without water: but beyond
the forty furlongs again it is well watered.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXVI</p>
<p>'THE author of the <i>Metrical Survey of Syria </i>says in his first book
that Jerusalem lies upon a lofty and rugged site: and that some parts of the
wall are built of polished stone, but the greater part of rubble; and that the
city has a circuit of twenty-seven furlongs, and that there is also within the
place a spring which spouts up abundance of water.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXVII</p>
<p>'PHILO too says, in his <i>Account of Jerusalem, </i>that there is a
fountain, and that it is dried up in winter, but becomes full in summer. And in
his first Book he speaks thus:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>'And so forth. Again, lower down he adds to these a description of the
refilling:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;For flashing from on high the joyous stream,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          The blessings of that wonder-working fount.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<p>'And the rest that follows. Then again, concerning the High Priest's fountain
and the canal that carries off the water, he proceeds as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;A headlong stream by channels under ground&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'And all that follows this.'</p>
<p>Thus far then our quotations from Alexander Polyhistor.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXVIII</p>
<p>BUT Aristeas also, in the book which he wrote <i>Concerning the
Interpretation of the Law of the Jews, </i>gives the following account of the
waters in Jerusalem:</p>
<p>[ARISTEAS] <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> 'Now the house looks towards the
East, and the back part of it to the West. The whole site is paved with stone,
and has slopes towards the proper places for the influx of the waters for the
purpose of washing away the blood from the sacrifices: for many myriads of
cattle are offered on the several feast-days.</p>
<p>'And there is an inexhaustible reservoir of water, as would be expected from
an abundant spring gushing up naturally from within; there being moreover
wonderful and indescribable cisterns under ground, of five furlongs, according
to their showing, all round the foundation of the temple, and countless pipes
from them, so that the streams on every side met together. And all these works
have been fastened with lead at tbe bottom and the side-walls, and over these
has been spread a great quantity of plaster, all having been carefully wrought.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXIX</p>
<p>BESIDES this, as Polyhistor has made mention of the prophecy of Jeremiah, it
would be a most unreasonable thing for us to pass it over in silence. Let this
then also be set down:</p>
<p>[POLYHISTOR] 'Then Jonachim: in his time prophesied Jeremiah the prophet. He
was sent by God, and found the Jews sacrificing to a golden image, the name of
which was Baal.</p>
<p>'And he foreshowed to them the calamity which was to come. Jonachim then
attempted to burn him alive: but he said that with that fuel they should cook
food for the Babylonians, and as prisoners of war should dig the canals of the
Tigris and Euphrates.</p>
<p>'When Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Babylonians, had heard of the predictions
of Jeremiah, he summoned Astibares, the king of the Medes, to join him in an
expedition. And having taken with him Babylonians and Medes, and collected a
hundred and eighty thousand infantry and a hundred and twenty thousand cavalry,
and ten thousand chariots, he first subdued Samaria, and Galilee, and
Scythopolis, and the Jews who lived in the region of Gilead; and afterwards took
Jerusalem, and made Jonachim, the king of the Jews, a prisoner. And the gold
that was in the temple, and the silver and brass, they chose out and sent to
Babylon, except the Ark and the tables that were in it: but this Jeremiah
retained.'</p>
<p>CHAPTER XL</p>
<p>To this I must necessarily append also the account of the captivity of the
Jews under Nebuchadnezzar:</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> 'Nebuchadnezzar having encountered
the rebel and joined battle with him, both mastered him, and brought the country
at once under his own rule.</p>
<p>'And it happened that his father Nabopallasar fell sick at this time, and
departed from life in the city of Babylon, after having reigned twenty-one
years. And when Nebuchadnezzar heard soon after of his father's death, he set in
order the affairs of Egypt and of the rest of the country, and having committed
the prisoners of the Jews and Phoenicians and Syrians, the nations near Egypt,
to certain of his friends, came to Babylon.'</p>
<p>After other statements he says:</p>
<p>'So then Nebuchadnezzar, after be had begun the wall before-mentioned, fell
sick and died, after a reign of forty-three years, and his son Evil-Merodach
became master of the kingdom.</p>
<p>'He governed the affairs of the kingdom in a lawless and outrageous manner,
and was plotted against and put to death by his sister's husband Neriglisar,
after having reigned two years.</p>
<p>'And after he was slain Neriglisar, who had plotted against him, succeeded to
the government and reigned four years. His son Chabaessoarach succeeded to the
kingdom, though he was but a boy, and held it nine mouths; but because be showed
many evil dispositions, a plot was made against him by his friends, and he was
beaten to death.</p>
<p>'Upon his death, those who had plotted against him met together, and by
common consent conferred the kingdom on Nabonuedus, who was a Babylonian and one
of the same conspiracy.</p>
<p>'In his reign the walls of Babylon adjacent to the river were handsomely
repaired with baked brick and asphalt. And in the seventeenth year of his reign
Cyrus came from Persia with a great force, and, after subduing all the rest of
the kingdom, invaded Babylonia.</p>
<p>'Nabonnedus, on being informed of his advance, met him with his army, and
having joined battle was defeated, and fled with a few attendants, and was shut
up in the city Borsippus.</p>
<p>'And Cyrus having taken Babylon, and ordered the demolition of the outer
walls of the city because the city had proved very troublesome to him, and hard
to take, moved his army to Borsippus, to besiege Nabonnedus.</p>
<p>'But as Nabonnedus did not wait for the siege, but gave himself up
beforehand, Cyrus treated him in a kindly manner, and, giving him Carmania to
dwell in, sent him away from Babylonia. The rest of his time therefore
Nabonnedus passed in that country, and there ended his life.</p>
<p>'This narrative contains the truth in agreement with our books. For in them
it is written that Nebuchadnezzar in the eighteenth year of his reign laid waste
our temple, and it remained unregarded fifty years. But in the second year of
the reign of Cyrus the foundations were laid, and it was completed again in the
tenth year of the reign of Darius.'</p>
<p>Thus far Josephus.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XLI</p>
<p>I FOUND also the following statements concerning Nebuchadnezzar in the work
of Abydenus <i>Concerning the Assyrians:</i></p>
<p>[ABYDENUS] 'Now Megasthenes says that Nebuchadnezzar was braver than
Hercules, and made an expedition against Libya and Iberia, and, having subdued
them, settled a part of their inhabitants on the right shore of Pontus.</p>
<p>'And afterwards, the Chaldeans say, he went up to his palace, and being
possessed by some god or other uttered the following speech:</p>
<p>'&quot;O men of Babylon, I Nebuchadnezzar here foretell to you the coming
calamity, which neither Belus my ancestor, nor Queen Beltis are able to persuade
the Fates to avert.</p>
<p>'&quot;There will come a Persian mule, aided by the alliance of your own
deities, and will bring you into slavery. And the joint author of this will be a
Mede, in whom the Assyrians glory. O would that before he gave up my citizens
some Charybdis or sea might swallow him up utterly out of sight; or that,
turning in other directions, he might be carried across the desert, where there
are neither cities nor foot of man, but where wild beasts have pasture and birds
their haunts, that he might wander alone among rocks and ravines; and that,
before he took such thoughts into his mind, I myself had found a better
end.&quot;</p>
<p>'He after uttering this prediction had immediately disappeared, and his son
Amil-marudocus became king. But he was slain by his kinsman Iglisar, who left a
son Labassoarask. And when he died by a violent death, Nabannidochus, who was
not at all related to him was appointed king. But after the capture of Babylon,
Cyrus presents him with the principality of<i> </i>Carmania.'</p>
<p>Also concerning the building of Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar the same author
writes thus:</p>
<p>'It is said that all was originally water, and called a sea. But Belus put a
stop to this, and assigned a district to each, and surrounded Babylon with a
wall; and at the appointed time he disappeared.</p>
<p>'And afterwards Nebuchadnezzar built the wall which remained to the time of
the Macedonian empire, and was furnished with gates of brass.'</p>
<p>After other statements he adds:</p>
<p>'When Nebuchadnezzar had succeeded to the kingdom, he fortified Babylon with
a triple circuit of walls in fifteen days, and he changed the course of the
river Armacales, which is a branch of the Euphrates, and also of the Acracanus.
To protect the city of the Sippareni he dug out a reservoir having a circuit of
forty parasangs and a depth of twenty fathoms, and put gates to it, by opening
which they irrigated the plain; and they call them Echetognomones.</p>
<p>'He also walled off the inundation of the Red Sea, and built the city Teredon
at the place of the incursions of the Arabs. His palace too he adorned with
trees, and gave it the name of the Hanging Gardens.'</p>
<p>I have wished to make these quotations from the book before mentioned,
because in the prophecy of Daniel it is said that Nebuchadnezzar, walking in the
palace of his kingdom in Babylon, in proud thought spoke out arrogantly and
said: 'Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling
place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty? ' <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
While the word is yet in his mouth the catastrophe which followed has come upon
him.</p>
<p>This then is enough for me to have quoted on the present subject.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XLII</p>
<p>BUT after all let me add the statements from the <i>Antiquity of the Jews </i>by
Josephus, where, after quoting word for word the sayings of numberless writers,
he adds the following:</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> 'Nevertheless the records of the
Syrians and Chaldeans and Phoenicians suffice for the proof of our antiquity,
and in addition to them so many writers among the Greeks, and yet further in
addition to those mentioned Theophilus, and Theodotus, and Mnaseas, and
Aristophanes, and Hermogenes, Euemerus also, and: Conon, and Zopyrion, and many
others perhaps (for I have not read all the books) have made no slight or
passing mention of us.</p>
<p>'Most, however, of the persons mentioned missed the truth of our earliest
history because they had not read our Sacred Books: nevertheless all alike have
borne testimony concerning our antiquity, the subject on which I proposed to
speak at this time. Demetrius Phalereus, however, and Philo the elder, and
Eupolemus, did not go far astray from the truth. And they deserve to be excused,
for it was not in their power to follow our scriptures with entire accuracy.'</p>
<p>So says Josephus. And any one who is pleased to read his statements
concerning the <i>Antiquity of the Jews </i>will find very many testimonies
agreeing with those which I have set forth.</p>
<p>Also there pours in upon me a further great crowd of writers both ancient and
modern as witnesses, who set their seal upon the like judgement with the authors
who have been quoted; but being anxious to preserve the due limits of my
discourse, I leave their utterances for students to search out and examine, and
will myself pass on to fulfil the remainder of my promise.</p>
