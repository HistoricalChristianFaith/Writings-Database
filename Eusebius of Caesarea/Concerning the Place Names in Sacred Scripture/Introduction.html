<p>The
author wishes to acknowledge the assistance of many scholars, living and dead,
and friends, not all of whom can be mentioned. First he is indebted to Moses&nbsp;Bailey and Alexander Sperber who introduced him to the labyrinth of the Onomastica
of the Bible before World War II. Thanks to Ernest Wright who in his concern
for the non-classically trained seminarians and neophyte archaeologists suggested
this English translation of the <i>Onomasticon</i> reputed to be Eusebius' as a
sabbatical project. Thanks to Edward Campbell for his insistence on an article
for the<i> Biblical Archaeologist</i> (Sept. 1964, xxvii, 3) which forms the
basis for the introductory critical remarks in this edition and are used by
permission of the American Schools of Oriental Research whose Jerusalem&nbsp;building was the seat for much of the research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to
the trustees of Harvard University for permission to quote from the Thackeray
translation of Josephus' <i>Antiquities</i> in the Loeb Classical Library. A
special thanks to the host of geographers who have labored over the <i>Onomasticon</i>
including among many Conder, Buhl, Thomsen, Abel, Albright, Avi-Yonah, Glueck,
O'Callaghan, Kallai, Melamed, and Mittmann. The basic text of Klostermann,
published in 1904, with reference to Lagarde, has been used in this
translation.</p>

Preface</a></h3>

<p>This English edition of the <i>Onomasticon</i> is
the first in the Western languages. It is a fairly literal translation of the
Greek text and is not intended for the classics scholar but for those who are
not versed in Greek, Latin and Hebrew, but are interested in the geography and
archaeology of the Holy Land. It is not intended for textual critics of the
Bible or of the <i>Onomasticon</i> although some of the notes and appendices
include variants and textual materials.</p>

<p>To avoid a double translation, the Greek and
Latin have been conflated except for the final editor's Introduction which
varies greatly in the two languages. Parentheses ( ) are used to indicate minor
variations in the Latin from the presumed earlier Greek text. Brackets [ ] are
used to indicate either a lacuna in the Greek text which has been emended from
the Latin or an addition of significance made by the Latin editors. The notes
on individual entries also indicate which of these occur in any given section.</p>

<p>The notes that follow the translation are not an
attempt at a biblical geography for which the reader has access to many good
volumes. They do not attempt an archaeological survey of the Holy Land. The
notes emphasize late Roman and Byzantine sites and sources especially when the <i>Onomasticon</i>'s
text makes some attempt to locate and identify a place or where the text is
confused. Not all Old Testament or New Testament sites are mentioned in the <i>Onomasticon</i>
and many of those which are have not been located in the Greek and Latin texts
so are not located or identified in these notes. Again reference to a biblical
atlas or geography is to be had for this detailed study.</p>

<p>New theories of identification and new
archaeological discoveries are appearing with great frequency. Some updating of
the <i>Onomasticon</i> locations is to be continuously in the works. The most
recent studies are by Avi-Yonah, Melamed and Mittmann with single studies
appearing in Israeli journals (<i>Israel&nbsp;Exploration Journal</i>, <i>Eretz-Israel</i>,
and <i>Tarbiz</i>) and others (<i>Biblical Archaeologist</i>, <i>Revue Biblique,</i> <i>Palestine&nbsp;Exploration Fund Quarterly</i>, <i>Zeitschrift des Deutschen Pal&auml;stina-Vereins</i>, <i>Deutsche Pal&auml;stina-Verein</i>, etc.).</p>

<p><A NAME="px"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|x</SPAN></A></p><h3 align=center><a name="Digitizer's Note">Digitizer's
Note</a></h3>

<p>I decided
to proof and edit this manuscript soon after my father's death. My father, Dr.
C(arl). Umhau Wolf, had spent more than four years of research, translation,
and writing on this <i>Onomasticon</i> project.</p>

<p>Originally
the Catholic University of America Press had requested the translation but when
the draft of the manuscript was sent to the press they decided that the
translation was too scholarly for their planned use in their <i>Fathers of the
Church</i> series.</p>

<p>Even
though he referred to the <i>Onomasticon</i>'s translation as "just a laundry list,"
I wanted the translation to be more accessible than just gathering dust in a
file drawer. The aged manuscript has faded making some entries difficult to
read and this has caused difficulty with the output from the optical scanner. I
have spent almost a year correcting the scanned manuscript and hope that the
final version has few errors. The manuscript should be considered a draft
manuscript and not a final draft for publication.</p>

<p>I did
very few editorial changes since my background in electronics and library
science leaves me quite ignorant of this subject. I have added the <i>Onomasticon's</i>
translation's Sections to the End notes. I have used diacritical marks only
where indicated in the original manuscript since there are some places that the
name differs only due to a diacritical mark. This causes a double entry in the
index for those places and names that have been used with and without the
diacritical marks. The endnote numbers were abandoned shortly after the
beginning of the translation for reasons unknown to me. I have completed the endnote
numbers to the translation. I have not changed the text where there is a
question mark (?) indicating that the text required additional research.</p>

<p>The
Klostermann citations were handwritten in the margins. I have included the
Klostermann citations in all end notes and have substituted the complete
Lagarde citation for the Lagarde section numbers located also as handwritten
additions in the margins. Each end note consists of the following elements: the
end note number; the place or name; the biblical chapter and verse from the
Greek text; the Klostermann text page and line number of the Greek text; and
the Legarde text page number and line number of the Greek text. After end note
number one, the citations are abbreviated using "K" for Klostermann and "L" for
Legarde. Where a place or name is not found in the Legarde text, I have
indicated "n/a; Lacuna in Greek Text."</p>

<p>The index
includes Greek variants of places and names found in the end notes. Also
included are the Arabic places and names that were italicized in the body, but
I have decided for ease of sorting alphabetically to eliminate the italics
throughout the index. I did not use the Latin textual variants for places and
names in the index.</p>

<p>Abbreviations
of books are expanded to full titles only when the full title is known to the
digitizer. I took the liberty of changing the journals listed at the end of the
Translator's Preface from initials to complete titles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1964,
my father spent his sabbatical leave in the Middle East. He, my stepmother, and
my youngest sister were residents at the American School of Oriental Research
(ASOR) most of that year while he did research for the translation of the <i>Onomasticon</i>.
During this time, I was <A NAME="pxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xi</SPAN></A> stationed at Asmara, Ethiopia&nbsp;with the U. S. Army's Signal Corps. I was able to travel to Jordan&nbsp;to visit my family and I had the pleasure of a short stay at the ASOR.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I would like to thank Roger Pearse, for his encouragement to
digitize the manuscript, his suggestion to add a biography of the author, his
word processing editing, and for placing the final digitized manuscript
on his web site's pages about Eusebius of Caesarea, <a
href="https://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/eusebius/">https://www.tertullian.org/fathers</a>. I thank David J. McGonagle, Director, The Catholic
University of America Press, Washington, District of Columbia (D.C.), for
assuring me that I had the most recent draft copy of the <i>Onomasticon</i>'s
translation's manuscript. Thanks to Mike Robinson, Reference Librarian, Bryan
Wildenthal Memorial Library, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, Texas, for obtaining, through interlibrary loans, the many books
that I requested during the digitization process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I realize that there are many excellent translations of the
<i>Onomasticon</i> in print today. I hope this translation may be a minor
supplement to these available translations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><A NAME="pxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p><h3 align=center>Dr.
Carl Umhau Wolf<br>
1914 - 2004</h3>

<h3 align=center><a name="Bibliographical Sketch of Author">Bibliographical Sketch of Author</a></h3>

<p>Dr. Wolf was born, in Baltimore, Maryland, a third generation German-American on both sides of his
father and mother. His paternal grandfather came to the United States from Alsace in 1871. His
father was a Lutheran minister with a Ph.D. in Classical Archaeology. He had to
be known by his second name, Umhau (his mother's maiden name) because his
father was named Carl also.</p>

<p>His knowledge of languages began with four years of Latin,
two years of French, and two years of German in high school followed by
Biblical Hebrew in Seminary and continued with Arabic, Aramaic, Greek, Medieval
Hebrew, Syriac, and Yiddish in graduate school.</p>

<p>He received a B.A. from John Hopkins University (1934), a B.D. from Capital
University (1938), an M.S.D. from Capital University, an M.A. from Ohio State
University (1936), and a Ph.D. from Hartford Seminary (1942),
dissertation title, <i>The pre-Masoretic Pronunciation of Hebrew According to
the Septuagint</i>. He was ordained as a Lutheran minister at his father's
church, Grace Lutheran, Baltimore, Maryland (1937).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After ordination and marrying Dorothy Rising, Dr. Wolf was
called to be the pastor at a dual Lutheran parish Zion, Jelloway, Knox County, Ohio and St. John, Kaylor Ridge, Holmes
  County, Ohio. It wasn't until 1990, while doing research for his
grandfather's biography, that he discovered that his grandfather's first
congregation, also as a newly married, was close by at Fryburg, Holmes County, Ohio. He remained here
until he was awarded the Jacobus Fellowship at Hartford Seminary, Hartford, Connecticut to complete
his doctoral thesis at the seminary.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf was called up to active service in May 1941and was
commissioned a First Lieutenant Infantry Chaplain assigned to the First
Infantry Division (The Big Red One), 16th Regiment. He completed, in
absentia, his Ph.D. while stationed with the U. S. Army at Camp Blanding, Gainsville, Florida. The oral exam
was waved and substituted with a written exam. The First Infantry Division
participated in the invasion of Africa from Morocco to Algeria. Chaplain Wolf wrote and had mimeographed a short "salaam"
note in Arabic to be scattered over the landing zone by aircraft and handed out
by soldiers. He spent the rest of his war service in the Allies' African
campaign directed against Field Marshal Rommel's German troops. He wrote a
memoir of his army experience, <i>African Asides</i>, which had to be submitted
to the U. S. Army Censors before publication. When it was returned to him, the
censors had one entire chapter crossed out and each page stamped "Unauthorized
for publication." Other chapters had entire pages and many paragraphs crossed
out. The uncensored bound typescript was donated, along with other items, to
the newly dedicated Chaplain's Archival Museum and Library, Fort Jackson, South Carolina.
<A NAME="pxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf was the Executive Secretary of the Johns Hopkins
Student YMCA after the war. He became a special student, postdoctoral courtesy,
under Dr. W. F. Albright at the Near Eastern Seminary.</p>

<p>In 1947, he accepted the Old Testament professor position
at the Chicago Lutheran Divinity School, Maywood, Illinois. Most of his
first students were World War II veterans. He was later promoted to the Dean of
Graduate Studies of the school. During his years at the Divinity School, he founded the <i>Biblical
Colloquium</i> and was secretary of the venerable <i>Chicago Society of
Biblical Research</i>. He became a member of the local branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and later became Vice
President of the branch. He published a children's book on race relations
called <i>Freddie</i>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1948, Dr. Wolf spent the summer at an archaeological
site in South Dakota doing what is known as salvage archaeology. Salvage
archaeology is a dig required by law to check out possible ancient Native
American sites before a bridge, large dam, or other new construction projects
can get authorization to begin construction. This dig was where a new dam was
to be constructed on the Missouri River just north of the state capital, Jefferson City. Native
American remains and minor artifacts were uncovered by the team and were turned
over to the South Dakota State Museum. One time during a storm the team had to take refuge in a
large stone horse trough as a tornado came through the dig site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf was awarded the Thayer Fellowship at the American School of Oriental
Research (ASOR) (now The W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research
(AIAR)) to study in Jerusalem&nbsp;(1950). He traveled alone to Jerusalem. His wife
arrived a few months later. She had the misfortune of being mugged in Cairo, Egypt&nbsp;while in transit to Jerusalem. John&nbsp;Badeau, President,
American University of Cairo, took her in and assisted her in obtaining a replacement
ticket to travel to Jerusalem, as well as clothes and luggage.</p>

<p>During his year at the ASOR he participated in the
excavation of Herod's Jericho&nbsp;Palace and assisted with the Library of Congress
cataloging of various monasteries' collections. The Wolf's were specifically
assigned to the Syrian Monastery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My father was one of Dr. W. F. Albright's "men" until he
was forced to turn down a Fulbright Research Grant to compare Iron Age pottery
in Egypt&nbsp;due to his wife, my mother, having been diagnosed with a
fatal brain cancer in 1952. Dr. Albright never understood why my father had to
turn down the scholarship. After that, Dr. Albright never spoke to him.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In 1952 with Dr. Albright no longer a sponsor or a friend,
Dr. Wolf had little hope of archaeological professional advancement. He
accepted the position of head pastor of the congregation at St. Paul's
Evangelical Lutheran Church, Northwestern Ohio of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, Toledo, Ohio. His wife died
during the first year of the family's arrival at Toledo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf remarried in 1954 to Betty Hartman, a
third generation member of St. Paul&nbsp;and a well-accepted radio and television personality. He
served as head pastor from 1953-1965. <A NAME="pxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiv</SPAN></A>
Some highlights of this Toledo period are
the establishment of an ecumenical project, the Annual Lecture at St. Paul,
featuring leading Catholic and Protestant scholars; a speaker at the dedication
of the National Islamic Center (now the Islamic Mosque and Cultural Center),
Washington, District of Columbia (D.C.); and active involvement with the small
Muslim congregation in Toledo which later became the Islamic Center of Greater
Toledo. In 1962 he was granted a sabbatical year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf took his sabbatical leave in 1964. He, his wife,
and his youngest daughter traveled in their Volkswagen bus from Hamburg, Germany to Jerusalem. They were residents at the
American School of Oriental
Research (ASOR), Jerusalem, most of that year. My father used this time to verify
Eusebius' <i>Onomasticon's</i> places' locations as well as assist with an
archeological excavation just outside of Jerusalem. He and his wife traveled throughout the Middle East for several
months. One trip through Iraq and Iran included time in jail in Kurdistan while the Kurdistan officials decided whether they were spies. My stepmother
wrote a well-received book, <i>Journey Through the Holy Land</i>, Doubleday Press,
1967, reprinted in 1968, about living and traveling in the Middle East. She also
reassembled pottery items using the shards from the excavation site.</p>

<p>In 1965 Dr. Wolf accepted an invitation to become the
Director of the Lutheran Institute for Religious Studies (LIFRS), a new
continuing education program for clergy and laity at Texas Lutheran College (now
Texas Lutheran University), Seguin, Texas. The program
covered the area of three Lutheran synods which served Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and New Mexico. Many of the
programs were ecumenical seminars and weekend conferences for opening dialogues
between the many racial, ethnic, and social groups of the four states. Some of
these meetings became very confrontational. He was a member of the Board of the
Hispanic American Institute. From 1972-1974 Dr. Wolf was active in the Texas
Conference of Churches on Aging.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf returned to Toledo, Ohio in 1975 as pastor at Hope Lutheran church. In 1977 he and
his wife published a text and leader's guide on retirement, <i>Ten to Get Ready</i>,
and the accompanying guide, <i>Leader's Guide</i>. In 1980, Dr. Wolf retired
from Hope Lutheran Church. For the next
twenty years, whenever he was in Toledo, he served as interim pastor of Washington Congregation of
the United Church, a "Transdenominational"
church.</p>

<p>During retirement Dr. Wolf and his wife spent the cooler
months in Austin, Texas
and the warmer months in Toledo. In 1990 he completed a biography of his grandfather,
George Wolf, who was an ordained minister who had served in Ohio, Indiana, North Dakota, and California. Dr. Wolf was
active in aging and retirement issues. He taught many ten-week courses in the Austin and Toledo senior centers as
well as the Austin Lifelong Learning Institute. He also was active in the Gray
Panthers and participated in picketing the United States President Reagan's
White House Conference on Aging at Washington, D.C. In 1999 they sold the Austin house and began permanent residence in Toledo. He and his wife
became the only non-black members of Ascension Lutheran church where they
worshiped the remainder of their lives. His wife died in 2001 and Dr. Wolf died
in 2004. <A NAME="pxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xv</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf enjoyed research, writing, and publishing. His
publications including articles, book reviews, and sermons have appeared in
many Lutheran papers and journals. He published articles (popular and learned)
in many non-Lutheran and sectarian journals. These include, but are not limited
to: <i>The Moslem World</i> (now <i>Muslim World</i>), <i>The Jewish Quarterly
Review</i>, <i>The Journal of Biblical Literature</i>, <i>Journal of Near
Eastern Studies</i>, <i>The Journal of the Chicago Society of Biblical Research</i>,
<i>Biblical Archaeology</i>, <i>Interpretation</i>, <i>Adult Leadership</i>, <i>American
Sociological Review</i>, <i>Christian Century</i>, and <i>The Christian
Advocate</i>. He also contributed articles in the books <i>The Interpreter's
Dictionary to the Bible</i>, <i>Supplement to the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of
Religious Studies</i>, and <i>The Making of Ministers</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf's books include a three-volume series, <i>Nineteenth
Century Lutherans in Northwest Ohio and Southeast Michigan</i>; <i>Biography of
Rev. George Wolf</i>, H.P.;<i> Biography of Nathaniel Carter: First Joint Synod
Negro Pastor</i>; <i>Biography of Marmaduke Carter</i>, the son of Nathaniel
Carter who was also a Lutheran Pastor; <i>Freddie</i>, a children's book; and <i>The

<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></h3>

<h4 align=center><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h4>

<p>Eusebius Pamphili, better known as Eusebius of Caesarea,
had the encyclopedic interests of ancient scholars. Although popularly known as
"The Father of Church History" because of his ten volumes on the history of the
Christian Church from New Testament times to just before the Council of Nicea,
Eusebius was an omnibus writer. "His erudition would be remarkable in any age;
the versatility of his studies is amazing and posterity owes him a heavy debt." <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
His works are used by students in many disciplines. At least twenty-nine or
thirty works are known by name, of which about twenty are extant or preserved
almost fully in some translation.</p>

<p>Even the classification of these works is difficult.
Foakes-Jackson calls Eusebius a chronologer, a theologian, a biblical student,
a topographer of Palestine, an historian, and an apologist. The editor of the newest
translation of the <i>Church History</i>, Deferrari has six classifications:
historical, exegetical, apologetic, doctrinal, letters, and homilies. Lake gives no
classification except a possible chronological division of four periods in
Eusebius' life: early period, 303-313, 313-325, and after Nicea.</p>

<p>Of the early period only <i>Adversus Hieroclem</i> is
extent, but other apologeti, and historical works belonged to this period. Of
the second, the same two types of writings dominate. The <i>Chronicon</i> or <i>World
History</i> survives in an Armenian and a Latin translation. The<i> Preparatio
Evangelica </i>is fully extant, while the <i>Demonstratio Evangelica </i>is
about half complete in our present texts. During the last great period of
persecution of the Christians by Rome there must have been a devastating burning of Christian
books, and the library of Caesarea would have been a principal target although no literary
reference to this tragedy remains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The renowned <i>Church History</i> or <i>Ecclesiastical
History </i>(<i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i>), originally with only eight books,
belongs to the period between the Edict of Milan and the Council of Nicea. The
study of <i>Palestinian&nbsp;Martyrs</i> also comes
from this period of improved church-state relations. After Nicea there are many
writings on Emperor Constantine, Eusebius' commentaries on Old and New Testament, his
geographical works and some theological and apologetic works. Except for the
first three parts of his geographical writings, at least fragments of all the
works from this last period survive, attesting the more favorable circumstances
of the Church.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an historian Eusebius bridges the gap in our history
from the Book of Acts&nbsp;to the Council of Nicea. Foakes-Jackson compares his
importance to that of Josephus&nbsp;who does the same for the inter-testamental history of the
Jews.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> Both were wide readers and often used their sources
uncritically. As scholars, favored with patronage from Roman rulers, they had
access to books and other political and military sources not open to all.
Although called "historians" both wrote their histories as apologies for their
faith. Neither is as complete as modern scholarship would desire, but despite
the many faults and lacunae they remain our only written sources for the
history of their respective periods. The historical writings of both are not
only similar in origin, nature and purpose, but are approximately equal in
length. <A NAME="pxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xvii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neither Josephus&nbsp;nor Eusebius was a fanatic defender of the faith. They can
hardly be claimed by one sect or party, yet their influence on their respective
rulers and on their co-religionists can not be ignored or minimized. Josephus
was considered a traitor or "Quisling," while Eusebius was called "heretic." He
was involved in the Arian struggle. He was sympathetic to Arius and some of his
best friends were Arians even if he himself were not theologically an Arian. In
an attempt to mediate the difficulties and to hold to a middle of the road
theology himself, he lost his opportunity for sainthood. His contemporaries
could not agree on his orthodoxy. The controversy over his theological position
continued after his death among other church historians and theologians, even
though he signed the Nicene Creed and the anathema decreed upon Arius.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
At the Council of Tyre&nbsp;in 335 he was accused not merely of heresy but of apostasy
since he apparently had escaped the persecutions of the first decade of the
fourth century unscathed. His later writings seem to be orthodox, but the
Arians still used him. He suffered even a greater loss of reputation when the
Iconoclasts quoted him at the second Council of Nicea and forced the more
orthodox to attack him severely. His reputation in the East never recovered
after the Photius schism, but St. Jerome in the West admired him and is greatly responsible for the
survival of his writings. Details of the controversy as well as summaries of
his many writings are not pertinent in this Introduction, but the classic
Smith's <i>Dictionary of Christian a Biography</i> is still a good survey. </p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Life of Eusebius">Life of Eusebius</a></h4>

<p>The name Eusebius is a common one. At least forty
contemporaries are called by this name. Another famous church father is
Eusebius of Nicomedia. St. Jerome also occasionally used the name Eusebii. Therefore, the
author of the <i>Onomasticon</i> is distinguished from the others by three
epithets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because he was the bishop of Caesarea in Palestine&nbsp;for a number of years he is often called Eusebius of
Caesarea. Some authors call him Eusebius "the Palestinian" which may refer to
this same fact of his bishopric or perhaps hint of his origin and birth. He
himself chose and preferred the name Eusebius Pamphili after his teacher and
friend, Pamphilius, the martyr.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No biography of Eusebius of Caesarea exists from
contemporary times. It is believed that his successor Acacius, bishop of Caesarea, wrote one, but
it is no longer extant. The place and the year of his birth are unknown.
Earlier scholars suggested his birth was between 275 and 280. More careful
recent scholarship places the date earlier, between 259 and 265.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
There is no evidence that he was not a Palestinian&nbsp;and perhaps even a native of Caesarea itself. His
parents were not Jewish, but again all proof that they were Christian is
lacking. Arius called him "brother" to Eusebius of Nicomedia but this probably
reflects Christian usage or theological kinship rather than blood relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Little is
known of his youth and early training. But he soon became a student in the
theological school of Caesarea founded by Origen. He studied under Pamphilius.
Their relationship became more than that of student to teacher. They were
friends and co-workers. Both were lovers of books and admirers of Origen. They
probably added new books to the illustrious library gathered together at Caesarea
by Origen during the last twenty years of his life. The theological, biblical <A NAME="pxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xviii</SPAN></A>
and exegetical tradition of Origen was most influential on Eusebius. Apparently
about 296 when still in Palestine&nbsp;as a student, Eusebius had his first glimpse
of Constantine.</p>

<p>The action of Eusebius during the great persecution is a
matter of debate and much speculation. There is no doubt that during part of
the time he was absent from Caesarea. But he visited the imprisoned Pamphilius sometime during
the period 307-310. There is a suggestion that he was arrested and held briefly
himself in 309. He also reports that he witnessed the deaths of other martyrs
in Tyre&nbsp;and elsewhere. After the death of Pamphilius in February
310, he fled to Egypt. It is suggested that he may have been arrested a second
time (or for the first time). He was released when peace was restored in 313
and he returned to Caesarea. As noted above he was accused at the Council of Tyre in
335 of betraying the faith and of making the pagan sacrifice in order to
survive. He did not suffer injury in the persecution it is true, but no
evidence was produced in 335 or since to prove his supposed apostasy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shortly after 313 he became bishop of Caesarea. When he was
ordained a deacon or priest is unknown. Some suggest he was not ordained at all
until elected bishop. In 314 a brief persecution flared up under Licinius but
it did not affect Palestine&nbsp;and Egypt. In 315 Eusebius is known as one who has been bishop for
some time already. About 318 the Arian troubles began to come to a head. He was
chairman of the Council of Nicea (the term president is deliberately avoided
here) in 325. He and Constantine&nbsp;seem to have agreed on policy for the most part. As a
moderate he felt the church could have room for both the followers of Arius and
of Athanasius. He usually voted, however, with the majority. But after Nicea he
spent much effort to prevent the complete alienation of the Arians from the
mainstream of the Church. There is no record of his stand on the Easter
controversy. Eusebius described some of the pomp of the Council in <i>De
Vita Constantini</i>. He played a large role in all the proceedings and sat at Constantine's right even
though Rome, Alexandria and Antioch&nbsp;outranked Caesarea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eusebius was bishop of Caesarea for almost twenty-five years. In 330 he turned down the
opportunity to become bishop of Antioch. He attended the Council of Antioch in 331 and the Council
of Tyre&nbsp;in 335. Similarly he was active in the Synods of Jerusalem&nbsp;and Constantinople in the same year. He was the chief orator for the 30th
anniversary of Constantine's reign. This panegyric was later attached to his Life of
Constantine. Eusebius remained high in the regard of Constantine and was a
close advisor to him at least from 325 on, if not as early as 313. Constantine died in 337
and Eusebius shortly after in 339 or 340 at about eighty years of age. His
successor as bishop of Caesarea was present at the Synod of Antioch in 341.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Caesarea">Caesarea</a></h4>

<p>Caesarea Palestine&nbsp;was located on the coast of Palestine in the Sharon&nbsp;plain. Its ruins at Qeisariyeh are eight miles south of
Dor and about thirty miles north of Jaffa. It had been the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman
procurators after the time of Herod&nbsp;until 66 A.D. It was the metropolis of Christian and
Byzantine Palestine and seemed to have served after 70 A.D. as the ecclesiastical
capital.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> <A NAME="pxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xix</SPAN></A></p>

<p>Herod&nbsp;the Great began to build a new Hellenistic city on the
site of Strato's Tower in 22 B.C. Strato's Tower was a relatively
insignificant town with its beginning perhaps in the Persian period. It is mentioned
by Zenon in the middle of the 3rd century B.C. Caesarea Sebaste&nbsp;was at least twelve years in the building and was
consecrated to Augustus&nbsp;in 13 B.C. Josephus&nbsp;gives us details of the glory and grandeur of Herod's Caesarea in his <i>Antiquities</i>
XV, 9, 6 and Wars I 21, 5-8. The public buildings were in the magnificent
Hellenistic-Roman style. The whole area was well irrigated by aqueducts and
drainage canals, and remained a garden spot for years, until neglect and
economic reverses gave it back to the sand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of Jesus' birth Caesarea was at its zenith. In 1961 an inscription with the name of
Pontius Pilate was found in the theatre excavations.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> The Jews of
Caesarea were among the first victims of the First Revolt's suppression.
Vespasian was acclaimed emperor at Caesarea in 69 A.D. and in 70 A.D. Titus brought the temple spoils
to Caesarea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The city was expanded further in the 2nd Century A.D. New
aqueducts, new roads and monuments were erected and the city became a colonial
capital and shortly thereafter a metropolis with the privilege of coining its
own money. By the end of that century there was a Christian bishop in Caesarea along with a
famous rabbinic school. In the third century a colony of Samaritans&nbsp;was established. In the Byzantine period, fourth to sixth
centuries, Caesarea reached new heights rivaling that of Herod.</p>

<p>In 639 Arabs conquered the city and brought an end to Roman
rule. For some 460 years the Moslems controlled the city and used its port for
commercial and military expansion. The Crusaders and the Moslems battled over Caesarea many times and
in 1291 its destruction was complete. Thereafter it was only a site for
temporary habitation by squatters as the dust, sand and malaria took over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century Moslems from Bosnia were resettled by
the Turks near the ruins of the Crusader city. Between 1937 and 1940 the Jewish
colony Kibbutz Sedot Yam was established near the Roman ruins. The glory of
ancient Caesarea intrigued the colonists and since that time many archaeological efforts
have been exerted toward the recovery of Herodian, Byzantine and Crusader
remains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Already in 1932 a synagogue was reported near the sea. In
1945 and later it was excavated. It has a history from the Roman period to the
Arab&nbsp;conquest. Italian archaeologists began digging in the
Herodian area about 1959, with special attention to the theatre. In 1960 the
Link expedition to the port was carried out. The large scale Israeli Department
of Antiquities excavation began in 1960 in the Crusader area. Excavation
continues apace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The history of the city is being refined by these
continuing archaeological endeavors. Perhaps the grand temple of Augustus&nbsp;has been found along with many other Herodian foundations.
One large Byzantine establishment may even turn out to be Origen's library. The
Crusader fortress and cathedral have been cleared and it has been recognized
that much of Byzantine Caesarea was obliterated by the rebuilding of the
Crusaders. <A NAME="pxx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xx</SPAN></A> &nbsp;</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="The Onomasticon">The Onomasticon</a></h4>

<p>It was in the flourishing Roman-Byzantine city of Caesarea that bishop
Eusebius wrote or compiled his four part geographical work, of which only the
last, the <i>Onomasticon</i>, survived the exigencies of time. According to the
preface, the three lost works were in some way preparatory for the <i>Onomasticon</i>
if not fully incorporated into it. Wallace-Hadrill gives these high sounding
titles to the first three works: 1) Interpretation of Ethnological Terms in the
<i>Hebrew Scriptures</i>, 2) Chorography of Ancient Judea with the Inheritance
of the Tribes, 3) Plan of Jerusalem&nbsp;and of the Temple with Memories relating to the Various Localities.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first was a translation or transliteration of Hebrew
proper names into Greek. This does not seem to have been much more than a
skeletal outline of proper names based on the Hexapla. Whether it included an
etymology of the place-names (and perhaps some personal names) as in the more
technical sense of an onomastical list cannot now be determined.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
Such a list is Jerome's <i>Interpretation of Hebrew Names</i> which is based on
Philo and Origen. Undoubtedly Eusebius had their lists and those of others, both
Jewish and Christian.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second was a list or description of ancient Judea arranged by tribes.
This was of course based on the tribal lists of Numbers and Joshua. It is
reasonable to suspect that almost all of this has been incorporated bodily into
the final work since one of the things the <i>Onomasticon</i> treats most
thoroughly is the tribal designation of each place based on the Greek text of
the tribal divisions. There is some inconclusive discussion as to whether this
description accompanied a map or was only a map. There is a map attached to the
12th century Latin manuscript of Jerome's <i>Onomasticon</i> in the British
Museum which could be
derived from Eusebius' map, if such a map existed.<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></p>

<p>The third was a descriptive plan of Jerusalem&nbsp;and the Temple area. In the <i>Onomasticon</i> many proper names of areas
in and around Jerusalem are separately identified and described, especially some
with New Testament significance. Probably this information was closely related
to the original plan for the complete work. The rediscovery of the HolyCity by Constantine&nbsp;and St Helena was responsible for this renewed interest.</p>

<p>The fourth part is the <i>Onomasticon</i> itself, which was
completed about 330 A.D. or shortly before. Several facts pertain to the
problem of settling the date. It is dedicated, as is the <i>Church History</i>,
to Paulinus, who retired as bishop of Tyre&nbsp;before the Council of Nicea (325), and died in 330. That
gives the latest possible date. On the other hand, the Greek text notes none of
the Constantinian churches, of which Eusebius knew and about which he wrote in
other works (so that architects and archaeologists use his works as primary
sources for the Constantinian foundation). Jerome, however, places the <i>Onomasticon</i>
late in Eusebius' career. Taken together, these facts suggest that Eusebius
dedicated it to Paulinus after his retirement as bishop of Tyre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Greek Vatican Manuscript the <i>Onomasticon</i> is
entitled "Concerning the Place-names in Sacred Scripture." The Latin does not
contain such a precise title. In general, the book is a geographical bible
dictionary within certain stated limitations. (These were breached by later
editorial additions and marginal glosses.) With a few exceptions the text
confines itself to the Holy Land as proposed in the preface. This of course counters the
plan to give all place-names of <A NAME="pxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxi</SPAN></A> Holy Scripture, since among others the cities
which Paul&nbsp;visited are missing. The preface also proposes that cities
and villages are to be noted, but the present Greek and Latin texts include
also wadies, deserts, mountains, districts and even an occasional personal and
idol name. Almost 1000 items, largely from the Old Testament and from the first
6 books, are recorded, of which about 400 are sufficiently described to warrant
an attempt at localization.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> Already in the time of the Survey of
Western Palestine, Conder claimed to have identified 300.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>

<p>The arrangement of the book is according to the Greek
alphabet from Alpha to Omega. Since the Greek letters do not follow the Semitic
alphabet there are some doublets as well as some transcriptional errors, some
of which were from the Septuagint LXX (hereafter LXX). Jerome in the Latin had to indicate some of the
places where the three alphabets diverge. In the present text - A - takes up
almost one quarter of the entire length of the book. Judah is the primary
area detailed, especially in sections -A- and -B-.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within each alphabetic division, the place-names are
arranged according to the order of the biblical books in the Septuagint,
beginning with Genesis. Numbers and Deuteronomy are often linked together as
one subdivision. In smaller alphabetic sections the Pentateuch is made the
first heading. The book of Leviticus is not referred to (see Appendix III). The
other major divisions are Joshua, Judges, Kings and the Gospels. I Chronicles,
Job, Maccabees&nbsp;and the Prophets are usually subsumed under Kings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>II Chronicles is rare and some of the place-names of I
Chronicles are omitted, but most of these were paralleled in earlier lists.
Esther and Daniel are not involved, probably because the majority of
place-names in them are outside of the proposed territorial scope of the
column. The greatest geographic lacuna seems to be Ezra-Nehemiah. In addition,
Rabbakkuk, Haggai, Malachi, Ruth, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Lamentations are
omitted although none of these has a strong topographical orientation. There
are only one or two, sometimes questionable, items from Psalms, Job, Song of Solomon, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Zephaniah and the Acts. The New Testament Epistles and the Book of Revelation are
almost completely ignored. Except for Maccabees&nbsp;none of the apocrypha or pseudepigrapha appears (see
Appendix III).</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Method and Sources">Method and Sources</a></h4>

<p>The treatment of each place name almost seems whimsical,
varying from one or two words to a whole page. The simplest entries are "tribe
of..." or "lot of..." and "station (camp) in the desert." Other simple
notations are the listing of the variant readings from one of the columns of
the Hexapla. Significantly for textual criticism (see below) the two longest
entries are both out of the supposed geographical limits, namely Ararat&nbsp;and Babel. Both are padded with direct quotations from Josephus' <i>Antiquities</i>. The longest legitimate entry is Beersheba.</p>

<p>Seven or eight items appear with more or less regularity in
the <i>Onomasticon</i> usually in the same artificial order. This arrangement
is not at all conducive to great literary style and the translation does not
attempt to smooth things out. Eusebius is not noted for style even in his <i>Church
History</i>. In the present work, as we seem to have it, it is the work of an
archivist who accumulated <A NAME="pxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxii</SPAN></A> miscellaneous facts. There may be also in these items
material for literary criticism. The items that occur are as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.&nbsp;A
word for word quotation of the biblical text of the Hexapla with some allusion
to variant readings. </p>

<p>2.&nbsp;A
generalized location of the place in tribal or provincial area which may or may
not be contemporary to the editor. </p>

<p>3.&nbsp;A
summary of the events or event associated with the place, with any Gospel
allusion usually coming at the end as an addendum. </p>

<p>4.&nbsp;A
quotation of or reference to other authorities such as Josephus.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;A
specific location in reference to the fourth (?) century towns and roads, with
or without indication of distance and direction. </p>

<p>6.&nbsp;A
modern name of the place and whether still inhabited or in ruins along with
reference to present memorials or tombs. </p>

<p>7.&nbsp;Notations
about the present inhabitants (pagan, Christian, Jewish, Samaritan) and some of their
activities. </p>

<p>8.&nbsp;Reference
to similarly sounding names in "other" regions. </p>

<p>9.&nbsp;Reference
to Roman garrisons and forts. </p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There can be little doubt that Eusebius based his work on
the text of the Hexapla,<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> that great compilation in six columns of
the current variant Greek texts which brought them into conformity with the
Hebrew (which appears as column 1). Caesarea was the place in which Origen produced the Hexapla. The
text of the <i>Onomasticon</i> uses the transcriptions of the Hebrew into Greek
letters (Col. 2) more often than any other Greek forms. Reference to Aquila&nbsp;(Col. 3), Symmachus&nbsp;(Col. 4), Theodotion&nbsp;(Col. 6), and Origen (Col. 5) in the text may also be
wholly from the Hexapla, although Col. 5 would represent other Greek
manuscripts of the Old Testament. A few of the Hexaplaric annotations are
marginal glosses later than the 4th century.</p>

<p>If Eusebius knew Hebrew he did not utilize the Masoretic
text, and unlike Jerome, was dependent upon the Hexapla. Some think there is
use of simple Hebrew by Eusebius in the <i>Demonstratio Evangelica</i> but this
Hebrew could also be derived from Philo and Origen. The few references in the
Greek version of the <i>Onomasticon</i> to "in Hebrew" could all be references
to Col. 1 or 2 of the Hexapla and require no great knowledge of either Hebrew
language or texts. As noted above they could be glosses or a later editorial
addition. The occasional etymological notations and the frequent quotations of
the interpretations of Aquila, Symmachus&nbsp;and Theodotion&nbsp;could also be accounted for in the same ways. Some of the
etymologies found in the Masoretic text in Hebrew are not utilized by the <i>Onomasticon</i>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional information based on the Bible includes the
lists of Levitical&nbsp;cities and the cities of refuge, as well as the stations
of the desert. Occasionally there is added reference to the capture of the
place by Joshua and the subsequent killing of its king, or the fact that the
tribe to whom the place was allotted was unable to dispossess the original
inhabitants and so take possession of their territory. Three times the
Samaritan&nbsp;founding of a city by those transported by the Babylonians
is noted. <A NAME="pxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxiii</SPAN></A> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Often the generalized location of the place is solely the
biblical location. The tribal allotments are fairly completely recorded. Of
course, Eusebius is confused as much as modern scholars about the real status
of border towns or other towns listed in different tribal territories according
to diverse texts. For much of this localization Eusebius must have had first
hand and personal knowledge of the country, although certainly not as thorough
as that of Jerome. The Greek text is more detailed and accurate in the location
of sites in the central hill country than elsewhere. Perhaps this was because
Eusebius, as bishop of Caesarea, frequently traveled to Jerusalem&nbsp;and also because his earlier sources were produced there in
Jewish circles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Topographic references are found in his other works. So we
find in <i>Demonstratio Evangelica</i> Bethlehem&nbsp;(I, 1; vii, 2), Mt. of Olives&nbsp;(iv, 18); in <i>De Vita Constantini
</i>Bethlehem (iii, 41f), Mt.
of Olives (iii, 41), Jerusalem&nbsp;(iii, 25-40), Mamr&#x0113;&nbsp;(iii, 51); in <i>De Laudibus Constantini
</i>Bethlehem (ix, 17), Mt. of Olives (ix, 17), and in <i>Theophania</i>
Jerusalem (iv, 18). These are but a small sample. In his <i>Church History</i>
allusions to topography and geography are especially frequent in the first two
books. Brief topographical notes are recorded also in some of his commentaries.</p>

<p>The famous library at Caesarea and the library of Bishop
Alexander in Jerusalem&nbsp;were treasure houses of source materials for Eusebius,
especially in his <i>Church History</i> and<i> Demonstratio Evangelica</i>.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
Anonymous sources seem to be referred to with "it is said" or "they affirm" but
whether these were written records or local oral traditions cannot be
determined. Josephus&nbsp;is quoted twelve times. The commentaries of Origen and the
writings of Paulinus were also referred to. Roman administrative lists, maps,
charts and military documents have also influenced the final recension of the
text, but at what date is unclear. The two early fourth century itineraries,
the Antoninus and the Bordeaux, are very close to <i>Onomasticon</i> and all three may
depend on a common source. Paula and Jerome, of course, used the <i>Onomasticon</i>
as one of several sources for their travels.</p>

<p>The Roman road system was well organized and charted.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
Many of the milestones of the first three centuries must have survived into the
fourth even though it was the custom of each emperor to install new markers as
a kind of memorial to his reign. For the most part distances seem to be
according to mileposts. The slight divergence between Jerome and Eusebius,
which is often only one mile, can be largely accounted for by the fact that a
site is seldom so small as to be only at one milestone and also that in
seventy-five (or more) years the roads and starting points normally would
change slightly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <i>Tabula Peutinger</i>, a kind of road map of the Roman Empire, is perhaps
contemporary with Eusebius (possibly a little earlier) even though all our
extant manuscripts are medieval. A check of some of the roads suggests that it
or its forerunner was a source for the <i>Onomasticon</i>. For example, on the
coastal road, Eusebius notes every point from Sidon to Ostracine except Apollonia. From Damascus&nbsp;to Petra&nbsp;on the "King's Highway" he has all except three
non-biblical stops, but adds the three biblical towns Madaba, Dibon&nbsp;and Heshbon. From Caesarea to Jerusalem&nbsp;nothing is missing. There is no doubt that the twenty-eight
places located by means of two fixed points and a milestone, as affirmed by
Martin Noth, are on the Roman roads.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> The formula is either "in the
border of city <u>a</u> <u>x</u> miles from city <u>y</u>" or "going from city <u>z</u>
toward city <u>b</u> <A NAME="pxxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxiv</SPAN></A> at sign <u>x</u>." Sometimes a compass direction is added.
Occasionally the distance is not in terms of miles, but of the number of days
needed for the journey (see Appendix V).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another method of localization is from a fixed point, with
a distance and sometimes a direction but with no definite road outlined. The
city is usually the datum point for location both by distance and by region.
There are 226 common distances of which 190 are based on a city and only
thirty-six on some other locality. Similarly ninety-three directions appear of
which seventy-four are oriented on a city and only nineteen on some other fixed
point.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> The four major cities of reference are Eleutheropolis, Jerusalem,
Legeon, and Hesbon.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> In addition there are ten city
regions in which villages are located, the more important being Eleutheropolis,
Jerusalem, Diospolis, Diocaesarea, Sebaste <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> and Neapolis&nbsp;(see Appendix VIII).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the use of the Roman road system and the
city regions, localization is also made by the use of the expressions "near," "around,"
"not far from," "extending up to," "between x and y," "along side," "midway
between a and y" (see Appendix IX). Distance is also variously recorded as "separated
from," "distant from," "going up to," "going into," "going down," "along the
road between" (see Appendix V). There is a possibility that different sources
were used and so reflect themselves in the various methods of localization. It
is quite possible that each editor had his own style for locating a
contemporary site or tradition. When the <i>Onomasticon</i> has been programmed
through a computer it may be possible to isolate clearly these editorial
additions. This would also be true of Latin translation of various Greek terms
(see Appendices I and IX).</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Eusebius was writing for his
contemporaries and some knowledge of the country and its oral traditions of the
time could be assumed even though modern scholars might wish for more specific
information. The different editors may have utilized other oral traditions and
travelers' information as well as their own personal experiences and additional
written sources. Priests and bishops from other areas of the Holy Land would naturally
exchange road information in the 4th century just as tourists and pilgrims do
today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most important is the data indicating the fourth century
status of the site. (This assumes Eusebius is the major redactor, but the
variety of terms used may reflect different traditions and strata.) Several
Greek words are used for "exists," "remains," "is still," as well as several
synonyms for "called," or "named," and "pointed out" or "shown." There is also
the reference to present inhabitants and importance which can be checked out in
other literature and by archaeological excavation. At least two hundred items
have a notation of fourth century existence of which three quarters are fairly
well localized and identified. A few sites are indicated as abandoned or in
ruins. It is possible that at times <i>topos</i> as well as <i>eremos</i>
represents a ruined site (cp. Galgala&nbsp;66:4 where both words are used together).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the incidental facts given is the religious
constituency of a town. Anaia (26:9, 14), a double village, is a Jewish village
which has a companion Christian settlement. There are eleven wholly Jewish
villages; three Christian, one Samaritan&nbsp;and one Ebionite recorded in the text (see Appendix II).
Heathen shrines are reported in at least three places. Idols are mentioned at
least ten times. A special interest is shown in tombs and memorials without any
critical analysis of contradictory items such as the various traditions for the
location of the tomb of Habakkuk <A NAME="pxxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxv</SPAN></A> (70:22, 88:26, and 114:15). Tombs of the
Maccabees, Mary, Abraham, Haran, Rachel, Joseph, Joshua, Jesse, and David are mentioned. Again these traditions may be
from several editors' hands. Jerome remarks on five churches built in the 4th
century (see Appendix I).<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually the last item to be noted is the presence of a fort
or Roman garrison. There is a very close parallel to much of the material
gathered in the <i>Notitia Dignitatum</i> which dates from slightly later than
Jerome's translation of the <i>Onomasticon</i>. The <i>Notitia Dignitatum</i>
or a similar work must have been used for the final recension.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Manuscripts, Editions and Translations">Manuscripts, Editions and Translations</a></h4>

<p>The basic manuscript for the <i>Onomasticon</i> is Codex
Vaticanus, Gr. 1456 which dates from the 11th or 12th century. For the most
part the hand is clear but there are still many errors, corruptions and
lacunae. According to a notation it once was in the Library at Sinai. It seems to be in a direct line from the original Greek.
Lagarde and Klostermann used this as their textus receptus.</p>

<p>I was privileged to check this manuscript in the Vatican
Library. It is contained in a volume of onomastica and is on pages 2 - 53. The
ink is dark and clear except for two faded pages 9 and 18. All the pages are
single columned except for the recto and verso of 19 which is a palimpsest and
has the text in two columns. The scribal hand seems to be the same throughout,
although some of the alphabetic divisions and biblical sections have been added
later by different hand and different ink. Alphabetic and biblical headings are
usually on the same line. Occasionally they are in red ink. The point is
regularly used after the place name and usually at the end of the phrase or
sentence entry. Prepositions and articles are usually not separated from the
following word.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dependent upon this manuscript is Codex Parisinus Gr 464
which dates from the 16th century. These two manuscripts were edited and
published by Lagarde in 1870. The second, Codex 464, was the sole source used
by Bonfrere in 1631 and 1659 for his edition of the <i>Onomasticon</i> of
Eusebius.</p>

<p>The translation of Jerome was made about 390 A.D. He
recognized errors in Eusebius and used his knowledge of Hebrew to correct the
transliterations and some of the etymology. He also corrected some of the place
descriptions and locations. Already in 389 Jerome has used some of this
material in his <i>Hebrew Questions</i>, which we have utilized from time to
time in the notes. The reference to this volume in the Latin was probably not original
with Jerome but cross reference by a scribe in the 5th century or later. Jerome
has more etymologies than Eusebius' Greek text, but this information was ready
at hand from his <i>Interpretation of Hebrew Names</i>, which is incorporated
in the notes of this present volume. As noted above Jerome was familiar with
the Constantinian and post-Constantinian church foundations. By various counts
between forty-five and fifty-five additional names appear in Latin even when
allowing for obvious scribal lacunae of Vaticanus 1456. <A NAME="pxxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxvi</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was through Jerome's Latin version that European
scholars and pilgrims became acquainted with the <i>Onomasticon</i>. According
to the Latin preface there had already been at least one earlier translation
into Latin. Several 8th and 9th century Latin manuscripts have survived which
were used rather freely by Klostermann to emend Vaticanus. These are the
Monacensis Lat. 6228, Codex Sangallensis 133 and 130, and Bambergensis B iv 19.
The Latin is really not an exact translation and Klostermann was a bit overly
optimistic with his emendations of the Greek. Latin editions of the <i>Onomasticon</i>
have been prepared by Martinainay in 1699 and by Vallarsi in 1735 and 1767.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Syriac&nbsp;translations of Eusebius' works were made very early and
often Syriac writers added new important information to the text. One early
geographic work called, "The Book of the Figure of the World" included the <i>Onomasticon</i>
as its fourth part. Unfortunately this is lost and known only by literary
sources, but could it possibly be the four geographic works of Eusebius noted
in the Greek preface? A manuscript of the 14th century was discovered and
partially edited in the early 1920's.<sup><A HREF="#21">21</A> </sup>This is a rather slavishly
literal work following the Greek word order and rendering every article, and
will be valuable for textual criticism if and when a new Greek edition is
published.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Procopius of Gaza&nbsp;in his <i>Commentary on the Octateuch</i> frequently
quotes the <i>Onomasticon</i>'s Greek text. These quotations often confirm or
correct the Vaticanus text. Already in 1716 Reland had recognized the
usefulness of Procopius in the study of the ancient monuments of Palestine. Thomsen and
Klostermann rely heavily on an eleventh century Procopius manuscript. The
Madaba Map is sometimes appealed to for emending transcriptions but this is a
dubious procedure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The earliest critical edition of the <i>Onomasticon</i> was
that of 1862 by Larsow and Parthey, followed in 1870 by Lagarde (second edition
1887). Klostermann's text appeared in 1904. So far the <i>Onomasticon</i> has
not appeared in the Migne series of Greek Church fathers although much of
Eusebius has been published there. It is about time for a new critical edition
of the Greek and Latin texts to appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1931-1933 Melamed published his important critical study
of the <i>Onomasticon</i> in a Hebrew journal <i>Tarbiz</i>. He also translated
the <i>Onomasticon</i> into Hebrew. The present volume is the first modern
translation of the <i>Onomasticon</i> into a western European language, the
first ever in English.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Pilgrims">Pilgrims</a></h4>

<p>Already before Constantine, interest in the places of the prophets and the sites of
the Savior's deeds had been aroused (<i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i>
iv, 26, 14). Both Clement of Alexandria and Origen showed scholarly interest in
the Holy Land
and they as much as Constantine and St. Helena are responsible for the knowledge of Palestine&nbsp;in the 4th and 5th centuries. Other pilgrims in the third
century followed Origen (<i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i> vi, 11, 2). Constantine's mother and
mother-in-law began the series of Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land which have
never ceased even in time of hostilities. <A NAME="pxxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxvii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of first rank is the Pilgrim of Bordeaux (ca. 332-333).
This is so nearly contemporaneous with the <i>Onomasticon</i> that one
hesitates to posit any dependent relationship, but there are many parallels.
Both had the Bible as a common source and both probably utilized an earlier
Roman itinerary and perhaps some lists. It is quite possible that the earlier "map"
of Eusebius was known by the Pilgrim. Later scribes probably corrected
reciprocally these two works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paula (ca. 382) and Silvia (ca. 385) came in the time of
Jerome and could easily have known and used the Greek <i>Onomasticon</i>. From
their time on there is no reasonable doubt that the pilgrims were dependent
upon the <i>Onomasticon</i>. There is real evidence of such dependence by
Aetheria, who may be the same as Silvia, on the <i>Onomasticon</i> for places
as well as forms of names.<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> Even allowing for the Bible as a common
source, the Greek text was primary also. The earlier Latin translation noted in
Jerome's preface and that of Jerome could also have been in the hands of this
pilgrim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the turn of the 5th century, the rise of monasticism,
the end of the Christological controversies, together with the peace and
security of the realm, brought many pilgrims to the Holy Land. Some followed
the example of Jerome and remained, while others returned to their homelands.
But a high percentage of them valued highly the <i>Onomasticon</i> in one of
its several versions. Next to the Bible, it was their basic guide and
companion. It "remained the vade-mecum of the pilgrims to the time of the
crusaders."<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="The Madaba Map">The Madaba Map</a></h4>

<p>The Madaba Map has been adequately studied by Avi-Yonah and
by O'Callaghan.<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> Their general conclusions do not disagree with
those of the first students of this mosaic map of sixth century biblical lands
found east of the Jordan. There is a very close relationship of the Map legends to
the <i>Onomasticon</i>. The map also parallels the so-called Jerome map of
medieval times which may have been derived from an earlier Eusebius map or
plan.</p>

<p>The area of the map and of the <i>Onomasticon</i> is
approximately the same. Byblos is the most NW site for both. On the East the line is Damascus&nbsp;and Bozrah. The Egyptian&nbsp;cities such as On and Memphis&nbsp;form the SW limit. A very high proportion of the sites on
the map are directly from the text of the Greek <i>Onomasticon</i>, according
to some estimates two thirds. This is even more significant a figure than at
first appears since the mosaic is a Christian map depicting Gospel sites. Less
than one fourth of the Old Testament sites in the area appear on the Madaba
Map. The division of tribal territory and the boundaries of the Philistines&nbsp;also agree with the Greek text.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a few instances the map even seems to follow the errors
of the Greek text: for Akrabbim, Anob, Thamna, Gedour, Bethaun, Adiathim, etc. In still fewer the mosaicist follows an
independent tradition: Emmaus, Geba, Ainon, Bethabara, and Dalah. He also has a more detailed knowledge of
post-Constantinian Jerusalem&nbsp;and Palestina Secunda than the <i>Onomasticon</i> could be
expected to reveal. Yet the absence of monasteries indicates that the source of
the map was prior in time to the fantastic monastic tide.<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>&nbsp;<A NAME="pxxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxviii</SPAN></A></p>

<p>For Garisim and Gebal&nbsp;the map apparently records both traditions: the Jewish
near Jericho&nbsp;and the Samaritan&nbsp;near Nablus, which later the Greek <i>Onomasticon</i> emphatically
denies as correct. In the few instances where transcription only, not location,
disagrees with the Greek of the <i>Onomasticon</i>, it may be that the map
reflects not a separate tradition but a Semitic designer who did not always
understand his Greek source. In addition to the <i>Onomasticon</i> and its "map"
(?) the mosaicists probably had access to one or more pilgrim itineraries and
to diocesan lists. This would be one explanation for the non-biblical names
appearing on the map, some of which are not entries in our text, but serve as
reference points only.</p>

<p>The Madaba Map, as the <i>Onomasticon</i>, has varied types
of entries. Avi-Yonah notes four classes, three of which probably derive
directly from the Greek <i>Onomasticon</i>: 1) A simple place name with no
additions but properly located in tribal boundaries, 2) the sixth century name
and the biblical name, which parallels "there is now" or "it is a village now
called," 3) reference to churches and other monuments, 4) eleven texts which
refer to scriptural events. In groups 2 and 4 the correlation with the Greek <i>Onomasticon</i>
is almost 90%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the large walled cities with towers behind on the
Madaba Map are called "city," "large city," "famous city," "metropolis" by
Eusebius. For the smaller cities with only a front wall and four or five towers
and for the larger villages with three or four towers connected by a wall,
there is no consistent correlation with the <i>Onomasticon</i>'s terminology.
(Nor is there any consistency in the various strata of the <i>Onomasticon</i>
that can be checked out in the present state of textual criticism and
archaeological research.) Both Beersheba and Ekron are called "large town" but are different as
depicted on the map. Does this imply Ekron had declined in the intervening
centuries? Bethzur and Bethel&nbsp;are both simply villages in Eusebius, but Bethzur is a
large town on the map while Bethel is small, having only two towers and the connecting wall.
Does this accurately record the changed fortunes?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Critical Study of the Onomasticon">Critical Study of the Onomasticon</a></h4>

<p>Textual criticism of the <i>Onomasticon</i> began with
Jerome. In his <i>Hebrew Questions</i> he corrected not only the text but the
facts of Eusebius. In the Latin version, Jerome not only improved on the
earlier anonymous Latin translation, but also reviewed Eusebius and his own
former conclusions. In correspondence and commentaries over a twenty-year
period Jerome corrected Eusebius as well as checked the Greek text. Modern
students must use these works of Jerome: Latin versions of the <i>Onomasticon</i>,
<i>Hebrew Questions</i>, <i> Epistles</i> 46 and 108 and miscellaneous commentaries.
The notes in this present volume include most of the relevant materials from
these texts. The <i>Interpretation of Hebrew Names</i> is sometimes useful for
checking transcriptions and/or transliterations and the occasional etymology of
the Greek text. The texts of many items from this are also included in the
notes to follow.</p>

<p>Whether Procopius of Gaza&nbsp;consciously emends and corrects the Greek text of the <i>Onomasticon</i>
or not, cannot be determined. But from the very beginning of modern
scholarship, his quotations of Eusebius have been used, e.g., by Roland,
Lagarde, Thomsen, and Klostermann. As noted above, the Madaba Map is not to be
considered a critical source. <A NAME="pxxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxix</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, literary or source criticism has seldom
appeared regarding the <i>Onomasticon</i>. In antiquity the authorship even of
such a prosaic agglomeration of materials was taken for granted. The witness of
Procopius and Jerome, as well as that of others less directly concerned, and
the notations on ancient manuscripts were considered sufficient proof of
authorship. Not until Thomsen and Kubitschek in 1905 and 1906 began their
argument over the streets and road network behind the <i>Onomasticon</i> was
any higher criticism applied, suggesting additions, glosses etc.<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
Kubitschek made much of the inconsistencies in distance, the apparent placing
of two different sites at the same milestone, assuming a roadway. He is
agnostic about Eusebius' use of itineraries, pilgrim reports (oral or written)
and suggests, although not directly, that these inconsistencies may reflect an
unscholarly card file system of recording all available information,
contradictory, reduplicative or not. In the reply Thomsen for the first time
admits possible glosses. He suggests that some of the Greek <i>Onomasticon</i>
may have been personal marginal notes on Eusebius' own manuscript (of
onomastical lists, his <i>Onomasticon</i>, Greek Bible manuscript and/or
Hexapla) and never intended any separate publication of the final redaction. According
to this theory, as they became unwieldy he arranged them in an alphabetic order
(if an onomastical list, this order may have been already established) and
according to the books of the Bible (or this arrangement could have been
primary as in the Hexapla or some onomastical lists and the alphabetic order
thus secondary). After Eusebius' death all such notes would be treasured by his
students and although revered as from his hand, nevertheless recognize as
incomplete. One or more of his admirers would try to complete it, correct it
and make it worthy of the bishop of Caesarea. The preface could be added in those days with no thought
of intellectual dishonesty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This revolutionary explanation for the contradictions,
doublets and inequities of treatment, as well as stylistic inconsistencies, was
forgotten for years and even the German school ignored it for a generation. As
late as 1943 Noth speaks as if one author and one date is to be accepted and
that Eusebius is the genuine author, not merely one of the last redactors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The detailed and precise work of criticism by the Jewish
scholar Melamed <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> in the early 1930's has been neglected, probably
because it was written and published in Modern Hebrew long before Israel&nbsp;had become a state and modern Hebrew a necessary language
for biblical scholars. Published separately as an offprint it made no new
impact. The recent monumental biblical encyclopaedia published in Israel has Melamed's own
summary concerning the <i>Onomasticon</i>, but this too is in Modern Hebrew.</p>

<p>In the first part of his criticism Melamed notes that the
Torah and the Prophets are the source for the basic text rather than all the
books of the Bible as proposed in the preface. In the New Testament only the
Four Gospels are primary. He concludes that all other references to places
cited in other books, i.e., the writings and Acts&nbsp;are from a second hand, as probably also the rare annotations from
Maccabees. He notes some could well be omitted because in Hebrew
there is little typographical material in such books. But the absence of
reference to Ezra-Nehemiah, Leviticus (except Levitical&nbsp;cities) Daniel's sites are probably considered outside the Holy Land as delimited in
the preface (see Appendix III).</p>

<p>In the second part Melamed treats of doublets, of improper
entries (e.g., personal names, idols, etc.), of confusions and lacunae and
notes that not even all the place-names of Torah, Prophets <A NAME="pxxx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxx</SPAN></A>
and Gospels are
recorded. He emphasizes the obvious confusion of traditions, the conflation of
transliterations. Part three concerns the use of the Hexapla and the fifth
column of Origen. Curiously the annotations from the Former Prophets have many
references to Aquila.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the fourth part his criticism begins to take form.
Noting that not all the alphabetic sections are divided by the same biblical
divisions, he lists certain Old Testament texts which have been given
exhaustive treatment, e.g., Joshua 21, Numbers 33, I Kings 9:15, and Isaiah 60. He
concludes that originally only cities and villages were listed with some
biblical information but without any contemporary geographical details. All
mountains, which are not announced in the Greek preface, appear in the Greek <i>Onomasticon</i>
out of their proper biblical order. So also all stones and rocks are not in
their proper place. The Dead Sea&nbsp;and the Sea of Galilee&nbsp;appear to be appendages at the end of their respective
sections. The idol Chemosh is out of place. Further, when two similar entries
appear with the second usually having "another" after the name, the first is
almost always where it should be in the biblical order, while the second or "another"
is properly entered only six times. This suggests editorial additions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the commentary on places which include among other
things, etymology, history, topographical identification (both biblical and
contemporary), allusion to versions, distances, roads and other names, Melamed
notes many variants and inconsistencies. Sometimes more than one historical
event is recorded in a single entry. Occasionally a reference is given to
Josephus&nbsp;but no event of history is recorded. There is a
stereotyped formula for many events in Joshua, such as "and killed its king" or
"did not drive out the former inhabitants (foreigners)." The notation "whence
David fled" appears almost as an afterthought. The lot of Benjamin&nbsp;is much confused. Not all the cities of refuge are called
such and they are variously labeled. There is also no single formula by which
fourth century [sic] existence is indicated. As noted before the same distance
from the same fixed point is given for more than one place. (This could be
accounted for by the quadrant use of directions, but not if on the same road
between the same two reference points.) On the other hand, there are double
entries for the same place giving divergent localizations. Etymologies are
rare, and as noted above, the obvious ones in the Masoretic text, such as Bethlehem, Melchizedek, etc. are ignored.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the <i>Onomasticon</i> only one place is from Mark&nbsp;and it appears also in Matthew. There is only one extensive New Testament quotation, that
from John. In all of the Gospel entries some history is recorded.
But many of the Old Testament names with Gospel associations do not have any
reference to the later history. When they do it seems to be from a secondary
hand. In twenty out of twenty-three New Testament references there is still a
clear tradition of the site at the time of the editor's addition (or final
redaction?). Therefore, only once is direction given. Usually distance is also
lacking. This of course could indicate that the tradition of the Gospel sites was
still too much alive to require more precise localization and identification.
The use of the formula "our Lord&nbsp;and God Jesus&nbsp;Christ" and other Christological formulations reflects the
fourth and fifth century Christology. The name Jesus does not occur alone. </p>

<p>In his conclusion, Melamed sees the <i>Onomasticon</i> as
basically a Jewish work from several Jewish hands. In all he notes four stages
of editorial work. In Tarbiz <A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> he was agnostic as to which was
Eusebius' own contribution, suggesting perhaps he was merely the final redactor
who <A NAME="pxxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxi</SPAN></A> Christianized an originally Jewish book by adding Gospel details. A
generation later in the Encyclopaedia <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> he allows more to Eusebius
as author and editor, at least giving him credit for more topographical
details, which of course were derived from itineraries, maps and administrative
lists, and all re-edited by his pupils and Jerome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above we have noted nine items that occur with more or less
regularity and in approximately that same order in many entries. Some lines
seem obviously not original, such as the extensive quotations of Josephus&nbsp;on Ararat&nbsp;and Babel. At best such references would have been noted "Josephus
affirms" or "of which we read in Josephus." These quotations are infrequent and
lengthy quotations rare. It is therefore not too radical to assume these
quotations are secondary editorial and scribal additions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The infrequent references to Gospel events in Old Testament
entries are usually tacked on as if an afterthought. This suggests that they
are also secondary, but at this point we cannot prejudge Eusebian authorship.
Similarly the notation about Roman garrisons most frequently occurs at the end
of an entry and could readily be considered an editorial addition if not a
marginal gloss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the rest, there is the same dilemma faced by
biblical scholars. There is the same problem of authorship and sources. Is a
man, even bishop and scholar, who annotated and re-edits an older book, or who
conflates, even poorly, two or more sources, an author? Is he still the author
even if he is re-edited by his pupils? Both Amos&nbsp;and I Isaiah have been worked over by their disciples, but
nevertheless are usually considered to be the authors of the major portion of
their books. Is only the final redactor of the Pentateuch ultimately the
inspired author or is the author to be considered the composer of the primary
and longer source? Is the source Q or any other behind the Synoptics the real
author even though tradition calls Matthew, Mark&nbsp;and Luke&nbsp;Gospel writers? Because there is no real literary style to
the <i>Onomasticon</i> and even his <i>Church History</i> is no masterpiece, it
would be vain to attempt a Wellhausenist literary analysis of sentences or
paragraphs. It remains for a programmed computer to read out traditional,
conventional, phrased or words that may be utilized to indicate separate hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No doubt the basic schema or framework of the <i>Onomasticon</i>
was originally a Jewish compilation of place-names in the <i>Torah</i> (and
possibly also the <i>Prophets</i>). This probably was centered in Jerusalem&nbsp;area. It may have been mediated to Eusebius through Origen
and his school with added textual information from the Hexapla. Whether the
biblical information on Old Testament places was in such a pre-Eusebian source
or not cannot be determined as yet. It is quite possible that Eusebius himself
added the Gospel items at the end of each alphabetic section of his source. A
student or later editors may have added the Gospel notes to the Old Testament
place-names in order to complete the Christianization of the book. Since the
topographical details seem to agree well with fourth century records and
archaeology, and since Christian tradition regards Eusebius as the father of
Palestinian&nbsp;geography, it seems reasonable to assume that he is
responsible for the topographical and historical statements in the majority of
entries even though he used, almost slavishly, certain Roman itineraries. The
interest in shrines and tombs could be from an earlier Jewish hand or from an
earlier distinct source available to our "author"-"editor." <A NAME="pxxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxii</SPAN></A>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>One must agree with Melamed that items out of their proper
biblical order are secondary. But at this point Thomsen may be more nearly correct than
Melamed. These could be marginal glosses, even from the hand of Eusebius, which
pupils or disciples incorporated, perhaps a bit carelessly into their copies in
such a manner as marginal glosses were included in New Testament manuscripts by
medieval scribed. Eusebius' study notes, questionings, etc. could thus have
gained validation which he would not have given them. Obviously by the time the
Greek copy and the early Latin version reached Jerome, the <i>Onomasticon</i>
had been to all intents and purposes complete as found in the Greek Vatican
Manuscript 1456. Jerome corrected it on the basis of new sources and his
personal knowledge of Hebrew and of the land, and brought it up to date
regarding fourth century Christian churches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <i>Onomasticon</i> as we now have it has a history of
development covering several centuries. It began as an onomastical list
(perhaps first only Levitical&nbsp;cities, cities of refuge and tribal allotments) as early
as Philo of Alexandria. In still Jewish hands it was expanded to include major
sites of the Torah and then of the Major Prophets. It is further enlarged by
the school of
 Origen with
major additions of text, interpretations and variant transliterations from what
is now called the Hexapla. This is made into a pilgrim's guide book to the Holy Land in the early
fourth century by the friend of Constantine&nbsp;and bishop of Caesarea. Eusebius' pupils incorporate minor additions and are responsible
for some of the doublets, perhaps from Eusebius' own marginal notes. Jerome
brought it up to date for the last quarter of the fourth century A.D. Medieval
copyists and scribes occasionally incorporated other marginal notes, more
Hexaplaric date and fleshed out the Josephus&nbsp;quotations.&nbsp; </p>

<h4 align=center><a name="The Onomasticon and Biblical Topography">The Onomasticon and Biblical Topography</a></h4>

<p>The average reader of the Bible assumes that a place
referred to in the Old or New Testaments still exists somewhere in one of the
countries of the Near or Middle East under the same name and in approximately
the same location. In his fancies, he is sure he could go there promptly and
find the precise place. One of the biggest disappointments of the modern
tourist-pilgrim is the conflicting opinions, the indeterminable and even lost
sites in Palestine. The scholar is likewise frustrated in his search.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scientific student of biblical geography and topography
is forced to face up to many problems, to choose among many possibilities and
claimants, and at times to be honestly agnostic. Thus at least two or three
sites are championed by different persons for the authentic Emmaus. Many are the problems, sites and arguments for (and even
excavations of) Gilgal. Scholars are hard pressed to determine if the seven
references to Aphek&nbsp;represent six or seven different sites with the same name
or only one. In the most simple topographical name, the historical geographer
can have at least ten variant traditions about its location, each with sub
variants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. There is the biblical site as it was during biblical
times. This may sound simple enough to define, but the biblical texts may refer
the same name to more than one location. Likewise even within biblical times
the settlement as well as the name could wander from the original location. An
explicit of this is Bethnimra. The Early Bronze age city was at Tell Mustah.
Across the road and beyond the wadi to the north is the Iron Age Israelite&nbsp;site, Tell Bleibel. Down the valley
<A NAME="pxxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxiii</SPAN></A> a short distance to the
West is Tell Nimrin, the Byzantine and medieval Arab&nbsp;site which retains the name. The present town of Shunat Nimrin&nbsp;is adjacent to this tell toward the Jordan. In modern Israel&nbsp;this movement of names is happening allover again. New
settlements and kibbutzim are taking biblical names, sometimes from a nearby
tell, sometimes on the basis of a biblical atlas or geography of the 30's, 50's
or later, and other times sentimentally chosen, but most frequently not exactly
on the original site. The exiles returning from Babylon&nbsp;confused the topographers in a similar manner.&nbsp; </p>

<p>2. The biblical site as Jewish tradition reported it is
also multiple. Even the rabbis quoted in the Talmud do not always agree.<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
The Targum, Philo and Josephus&nbsp;complicate the tradition enough, let along what happens to
it in medieval Jewish scholarship.</p>

<p>3. The first known Christian topographer, Eusebius, sought
to identify the biblical site as it was in biblical times. But it is already
obvious that his text is not always clear and that there are contradictory
localizations for the same place. The roads are not always clear, directions
may involve the entire quadrant of the compass, and spellings are confused. On
top of that, the tradition reported by Eusebius reflects at best a post-Old
Testament, perhaps even post-biblical, and therefore late decision.</p>

<p>4. The site as Jerome found it in the Jewish tradition is
usually cited under "The Hebrews&nbsp;affirm." This would be a fourth stream which might have
been utilized by Eusebius and still other early Christian topographers. This is
not always the same as the fifth.</p>

<p>5. This is the site as Jerome interpreted the text of the
Scripture and the text and traditions of the <i>Onomasticon</i>.</p>

<p>6. Both 4 and 5 may be quite distinct from the site as
Jerome determined it by his own personal experience and study. But even this
sixth stream is complicated since Jerome does not always agree with himself (or
at least various Latin editors did not agree). As even a good scholar in the
20th century should, Jerome reserved the right to change his mind. His
commentaries, Epistles 48 and 108, as well as <i>Hebrew Questions</i> do not
always agree with the Latin <i>Onomasticon</i>'s text.</p>

<p>7. Because of our problems with the third through sixth
possibilities there is then a seventh to be accounted for. This is the site as
Jewish (later Israeli) and German (rarely French, English and American)
scholars in the last two centuries interpreted the data in Eusebius and Jerome.
The ZDPV is full of debates on this subject.<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. After Eusebius came the full surge of pious pilgrims. Their
reports of shrines, tombs, churches, pagan remnants, and sites in general are
often in conflict with one another. Because of the exigencies of the times,
names and even whole districts were shifted (cf. <i>Onomasticon</i> on Garizin&nbsp;and Gaibel).</p>

<p>9. The crusaders developed a whole new Palestinian&nbsp;topography which is a study in itself. For the most part
they tended to concentrate all the important sites within the small territory
held by <A NAME="pxxxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxiv</SPAN></A> the Latins and so compressed one tradition into another for the
convenience of the pious as well as for their safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. Finally, the site in Moslem tradition and among Arab&nbsp;geographers marks the first revival of scholarly study
after the 4th century. Saarisalo <A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> and others suggest that Arab&nbsp;tradition of Old Testament sites is more reliable than
Christian tradition of New Testament sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The site then as the first western and European scholars
determined it could be any of the preceding ten, depending on the weight and
worth given to each respective tradition by the investigators. Unfortunately it
is also fairly certain that they added new traditions as they were misled by
over helpful but ignorant guides who answered happily, but erroneously,
misleading questions in "pidgin-Arabic." This is perhaps an eleventh claim with
which we must reckon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <i>Onomasticon</i> concerns primarily the third through
the seventh levels above. It is only a secondary source for the first two, but
still valuable. It is the first scientific work on biblical topography extant,
accumulating perhaps four to five centuries of tradition, oral and written,
into one complex, confusing and exasperating manuscript. Despite its errors,
lacunae and obscurities it must be used and has been used by scholars since the
time of Reland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One reason for valuing this secondary source is simply
chronology. Conder stated it plainly: it is "a witness to survival of Hebrew
nomenclature of the country in the fourth century, even more perfectly
preserved than now." <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> This same argument is presently used for the
textual value of the Dead Sea&nbsp;Scrolls and the ones from other nearby caves. Yet, even
Conder recognized that in the <i>Onomasticon</i> "we see tradition not made but
in the process of making." <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> Actually it is both. Eusebius has
preserved for us Jewish traditions that may go back beyond New Testament times,
but he also has added his own fourth century fact and fiction (plus later
additions of editors and scribes) to the corpus of topographical tradition
which in not always reconcilable to the Bible. The <i>Onomasticon</i> is more
exact than the Bible itself, since the Scriptures do not pretend to be
geographical documents and do not attempt to make any specific localizations on
the basis of directions (the only exceptions being the tribal boundary lists
and such vague terms as "east of," "opposite" etc.).</p>

<p>It is most probable that the <i>Onomasticon</i> can be
taken as a primary source for the fourth century, although with further
literary criticism and archaeological comparison it may become a primary source
for earlier centuries. "The <i>Onomasticon</i> in any case seems to be an
introduction to the knowledge of the occupation of the land in the fourth
Christian century. For his own time, and only for this has the <i>Onomasticon</i>
the value of an original important source for us, since the situation made it
possible for him to be exact on the places of his own time" <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
The <i>Deutschen</i> <i>Palestina Vereins</i> has therefore taken Eusebius
seriously and for his own sake.<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> Avi-Yonah based much of his study
of the Roman Map of Palestine&nbsp;(ca. 300) on the information in the <i>Onomasticon</i> and
more recently used it to develop the economic history of the Byzantine period.<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
Those interested in New Testament sites and early Christian churches also have
utilized the Greek and Latin texts of the <i>Onomasticon</i>.<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>&nbsp;<A NAME="pxxxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxv</SPAN></A></p>

<p>Since according to Lapp, less than 2% of the ancient sites
in Palestine&nbsp;are excavated and none of these completely,<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
surface sherding is requisite. Glueck pioneered this work in Transjordan&nbsp;and the Negev. Others in Israel&nbsp;have intensively surveyed smaller areas. Mittmann has
outlined in his thesis the East Jordan&nbsp;territory to the North. Besides the DPV others schools such
as the &Eacute;cole Biblique, the ASOR (now the Albright Institute), the Franciscans
and the Department of Antiquity of Jordan and Israel have conducted sherding trips. However, only ZDPV
consistently publishes the results and no school, museum or other agency
coordinates or files the reports of the others, so much is lost and not
available to this study.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The work of Glueck, Avi-Yonah, Mittmann and others
indicates that the late Roman and Byzantine periods were most prosperous.
Unfortunately Glueck aid not include a Byzantine map similar to that of Early
Bronze and Iron sites in Transjordan, but the count is almost astronomical for sites that
should be on such a map for Transjordan alone as a reading of Glueck's volumes
and the narrow territory of Mittmann's thesis indicate. These surveys and
others personally made or heard about by the author corroborate the high number
of sites reported in the <i>Onomasticon</i> as still inhabited in the 4th
century even if density of population figures are still not scientifically
precise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The area of Eusebius' competence seems to end at a line
east and west through the Northern tip of the Dead
 Sea&nbsp;and then going north along the ridge of the Ammonite
plateau. In south Judea, Moab&nbsp;and Edam he is less knowledgeable even in his own topographical
information of contemporary towns and garrisons. He knows the hill country
around Jerusalem&nbsp;best. The coastal plain and the Jordan&nbsp;valley are adequately reported. Samaria&nbsp;and Galilee&nbsp;are fairly well described.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The area encompassed by the <i>Onomasticon</i> (even as
outlined in the Greek preface) is basically the Old Testament idealized
boundary "from Don to Beersheba." When Eusebius uses the term "Palestine" it is
frequently non-historical. It may even be anachronistic, as it has been since
1948 with the establishment of the new state of Israel. The terms Samaria, Perea&nbsp;(called by Jerome Transjordan&nbsp;after the biblical phrase), Galilee&nbsp;and Idumea&nbsp;all have indefinable limits. Palestine Prima, Secunda,
Tertia may at times be referred to and if so will be noted in the separate
entry's notes to follow. Part of the confusion is the conglomeration of sources
from various dates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As noted above the city and its district are the basis for
topography and these are more important than the provincial descriptions.
Melamed finds six Transjordanian areas centered around cities: Susita, Pella, Amman, Heshbon, Kerak and Petra. In the west there are twelve such centers according to
him: Sepphoris, Tabor, Bethshan, Acco, Caesarea, Sebaste, Diospolis, Jericho, Jerusalem, Eleutheropolis, Hebron&nbsp;and Beersheba. Not all of these are important to the <i>Onomasticon</i>
as Appendices V, VI and VIII indicate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Villages are well located by Eusebius in these
city-districts. If our finding them today is difficult, it is not so much the
fault of the ancient writers as of other factors. As in the 20th century, so in
the 4th, a village was not a single tell and a city was not a narrow spot at a
milestone as some scholars seem to assume. Tell Deir 'Alla, Franken points out,
is only a small section of the total location of Deir 'Alla as known to the
natives today. To limit Livias&nbsp;(Julius) to Tell er-Rameh <A NAME="pxxxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxvi</SPAN></A>
even if it fits Eusebius closely is to be unrealistic.
Similarly Gadara&nbsp;is not merely the tell of Umm Qeis&nbsp;still inhabited and bordered north and south by Roman
theatres. Even though names may have shifted they may often remain within the
general district. Many of the towns are listed on the border, not only in
biblical tribal allotments but also in the municipalities of the <i>Onomasticon</i>.
Avi-Yonah in his map of Roman Palestine&nbsp;notes the region of a city or town properly on the basis
of; first, all the inhabited places mentioned as belonging to it, second, all
places whose localization is determined by measurement from it, and third all
territory watered by the aqueduct (see Appendix V).<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another difficulty in studying Eusebian topography has been
the false assumption that distance always indicates a town on a Roman road.
However, important villages and tells today are often indicated by mileage but
are not on the main road. There is no necessity to limit Eusebius' site to
known Roman roads. Even when he is measuring from and along a Roman road, the
site may be indicated by noting the point at which one takes off over the hills
with or without benefit of track or path to find that village (e.g., Bethel). Although the debate about roads and Eusebius continues
we must remember he was not writing a book about Roman highways but at best
utilizing a Roman map or garrison list to help him locate biblical sites as
best he could.</p>

<p>Text and archaeology will soon be able to check one
another. Most of Eusebius' fixed points of reference were important cities in
the 4th century according to other written sources and archaeology. But it is
still not possible to check his terminology or classification of towns and
villages archaeologically. The use of nouns and adjectives in Greek or Latin
may reflect just as much an editor's style or propensity as a change in
fortune. After all, size is relative without area and population measurements.
Jerome is not at all consistent in the translation of the Greek (any more than
he is or should be in the Vulgate - see Appendix IX). If Jerome were trying to
indicate a change in significance by a change in terminology, we may soon be
able to check the facts archaeologically. The corpus of Palestinian&nbsp;pottery is gradually being extended into the 4th century
through Caesarea, Araq al Emir and other pottery now that the Byzantine levels are not
considered dump to be bulldozed away to get down to Israelite&nbsp;levels. But as far as possible the existence of fourth
century settlements has been checked in the present study. Details of the
results will be in the notes on individual entries to follow.&nbsp;<A NAME="pxxxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxvii</SPAN></A></p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h4>

<p>It is obvious that the
author, whoever that may be, did not fulfill completely the purpose as stated
in the preface. The <i>Onomasticon</i> is not a complete topography of Palestine&nbsp;of the Old and New Testaments (see Appendix III). It is
not an historical geography to the Holy Land since not all the biblical or post-biblical facts have
been summarized despite the numerous editorial additions layer on layer. The <i>Onomasticon</i>
does provide us an extant list of Greek transliterations of Hebrew place-names
based largely on the no longer extant Hexapla. Incidentally that makes it a
valuable source for textual study of the Hexapla. The quotations of the Greek
Bible and the references to the six columns of Origen are important critical
resources.</p>

<p>The <i>Onomasticon</i>
in its present form has provided an almost complete tribal division for the
allotments in Joshua. Judah is most complete. Unfortunately not all the sites were
located or identified in the 4th century. There is no evidence that all this
information was in the lost description of Judea, part two of Eusebius' geographical opus, but that may
have been incorporated into this work and could account for the Jerusalem-Eleutheropolis-Chebron triangle being so well done. If, however, the <i>Onomasticon</i>
was accompanied by a map the location of minor border towns could have been
left to the map alone and the curt notation "tribe of..." which is valueless
for our purposes would have been sufficient for the ancient reader.</p>

<p>The <i>Onomasticon</i> provides
us with a contemporary knowledge of fourth century Palestine&nbsp;and Transjordan. Some two hundred sites were positively inhabited in that
time and as such Eusebius' work is a primary source for geography of the holy
Land as seen in the 4th century.</p>

<p>The stated purpose of
the fourth and final geographical work attributed to Eusebius was to identify
biblical place-names and to associate them with known places in the fourth
century. "The special work of Eusebius is the positive identification of
biblical places with those which were known in the country in his day and
herein lies the immeasurable value of his work all." <A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
This was done
on the basis of many sources as noted above: Jewish, Roman, Christian, as well
as oral tradition. The methodology has been followed by many scholars of the
last two centuries when they based many identifications on real or imagined
survivals of the name in similarly sounding names. Of course, this principle is
open to attack especially when applied by persons with little linguistic or
philological knowledge and left unchecked by archaeological research.</p>

<p>Adapting the
conclusions of both Reland and Conder <A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> we may sum up the value of
the <i>Onomasticon</i>. Its worth is highest where Greek and Latin texts agree.
The orthography of biblical names, especially in the Hexapla, can be restored
by the use of the <i>Onomasticon</i>. The similar sounding names reflect a
source and a survival fifteen hundred years older than any today, and record
some which are otherwise lost today. The defects are largely matters of
precision and lacunae. The principal cities are not defined as to their
relative position and there is no sure, fixed point from which the mileage is
known to have been taken. The description of locations are too often vague and
even when compass directions are given they are limited to the four cardinal
points and so are ambiguous, at least a quadrant being involved, and at times
contradictory between Greek and Latin texts. The text as preserved to us in
final redaction is often a heterogeneous agglomerate of unrelated materials
assembled by many hands over several centuries. The principle of similar
sounding names is tenuous at best. <A NAME="pxxxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxviii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even
though Abel&nbsp;has been criticized for too much reliance on the
similarity of sounds, his judgment of the <i>Onomasticon</i> stands: "The <i>Onomasticon</i>
despite its errors and its faults is of great help for knowledge of Palestine&nbsp;of
biblical times and of the Byzantine period."
<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> It is hoped that this volume will make some small contribution to
biblical and
Byzantine topography (limited to <i>Onomasticon</i>'s localizations and
identifications) as well as permit English speaking students and Bible readers
to reassess Eusebius as a geographer. <A NAME="pxxxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxix</SPAN></A>&nbsp; </p>
