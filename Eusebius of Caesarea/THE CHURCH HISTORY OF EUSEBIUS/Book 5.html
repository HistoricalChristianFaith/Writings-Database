<FONT  SIZE=3>Introduction.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 Soter,<SUP><A HREF="#P2733_1313474">1</A></SUP> bishop of the church of Rome, died after an episcopate of eight years, and was succeeded by Eleutherus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2734_1313628">2</A></SUP> the twelfth from the apostles. In the seventeenth year of the Emperor Antoninus Verus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2735_1315326">3</A></SUP> the persecution of our people was rekindled more fiercely in certain districts on account of an insurrection of the masses in the cities; and judging by the number in a single nation, myriads suffered martyrdom throughout the world. A record of this was written for posterity, and in truth it is worthy of perpetual remembrance.</P>

<P>2 A full account, containing the most reliable information on the subject, is given in our Collection of Martyrdoms,<SUP><A HREF="#P2737_1317755">4</A></SUP> which constitutes a narrative instructive as well as historical. I will repeat here such portions of this account as may be needful for the present purpose.</P>

<P>3 Other writers of history record the victories of war and trophies won from enemies, the skill of generals, and the manly bravery of soldiers, defiled with blood and with innumerable slaughters for the sake of children and country and other possessions.</P>

<P>4 But our narrative of the government of God<SUP><A HREF="#P2740_1318859">5</A></SUP> will record in ineffaceable letters the most peaceful wars waged in behalf of the peace of the soul, and will tell of men doing brave deeds for truth rather than country, and for piety rather than dearest friends. It will hand down to imperishable remembrance the discipline and the much-tried fortitude of the athletes of religion, the trophies won from demons, the victories over invisible enemies, and the crowns placed upon all their heads.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2742_1319891"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter I. <I>The Number of Those Who Fought for Religion in Gaul Under Verus and the Nature of Their Conflicts.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 The country in which the arena was prepared for them was Gaul, of which Lyons and Vienne<SUP><A HREF="#P2744_1320091">6</A></SUP> are the principal and most celebrated cities. The Rhone passes through both of them, flowing in a broad stream through the entire region. </P>

<P>2 The most celebrated churches in that country sent an account of the witnesses<SUP><A HREF="#P2746_1320421">7</A></SUP> to the churches in Asia and Phrygia, relating in the following manner what was done among them.</P>

<P> I will give their own words.<SUP><A HREF="#P2748_1320974">8</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3 "The servants of Christ residing at Vienne and Lyons, in Gaul, to the brethren through out Asia and Phrygia, who hold the same faith and hope of redemption, peace and grace and glory from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."</P>

<P>4 Then, having related some other matters, they begin their account in this manner: "The greatness of the tribulation in this region, and the fury of the heathen against the saints, and the sufferings of the blessed witnesses, we cannot recount accurately, nor indeed could they possibly be recorded.</P>

<P>5 For with all his might the adversary fell upon us, giving us a foretaste of his unbridled activity at his future coming. He endeavored in every manner to practice and exercise his servants against the servants of God, not only shutting us out from houses and baths and markets, but forbidding any of us to be seen in any place whatever.</P>

<P>6 But the grace of God led the conflict against him, and delivered the weak, and set them as firm pillars, able through patience to endure all the wrath of the Evil One. And they joined battle with him, undergoing all kinds of shame and injury; and regarding their great sufferings as little, they hastened to Christ, manifesting truly that `the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.'<SUP><A HREF="#P2753_1325865">9</A></SUP> </P>

<P>7 First of all, they endured nobly the injuries heaped upon them by the populace; clamors and blows and draggings and robberies and stonings and imprisonments,<SUP><A HREF="#P2755_1326044">10</A></SUP> and all things which an infuriated mob delight in inflicting on enemies and adversaries.</P>

<P>8 Then, being taken to the forum by the chiliarch<SUP><A HREF="#P2757_1326552">11</A></SUP> and the authorities of the city, they were examined in the presence of the whole multitude, and having confessed, they were imprisoned until the arrival of the governor.</P>

<P>9 When, afterwards, they were brought before him, and he treated us with the utmost cruelty, Vettius Epagathus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2759_1326955">12</A></SUP> one of the brethren, and a man filled with love for God and his neighbor, interfered. His life was so consistent that, although young, he had attained a reputation equal to that of the elder Zacharias: for he `walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless,'<SUP><A HREF="#P2760_1329221">13</A></SUP> and was untiring in every good work for his neighbor, zealous for God and fervent in spirit. Such being his character, he could not endure the unreasonable judgment against us, but was filled with indignation, and asked to be permitted to testify in behalf of his brethren, that there is among us nothing ungodly or impious.</P>

<P>10 But those about the judgment seat cried out against him, for he was a man of distinction; and the governor refused to grant his just request, and merely asked if he also were a Christian. And he, confessing this with a loud voice, was himself taken into the order<SUP><A HREF="#P2762_1329829">14</A></SUP> of the witnesses, being called the Advocate of the Christians, but having the Advocate<SUP><A HREF="#P2763_1330157">15</A></SUP> in himself, the Spirit<SUP><A HREF="#P2764_1330215">16</A></SUP> more abundantly than Zacharias.<SUP><A HREF="#P2765_1330795">17</A></SUP> He showed this by the fullness of his love, being well pleased even to lay down his life<SUP><A HREF="#P2766_1330905">18</A></SUP> in defense of the brethren. For he was and is a true disciple of Christ, `following the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.'<SUP><A HREF="#P2767_1331049">19</A></SUP> </P>

<P>11 "Then the others were divided,<SUP><A HREF="#P2769_1331101">20</A></SUP> and the proto-witnesses were manifestly ready, and finished their confession with all eagerness. But some appeared unprepared and untrained, weak as yet, and unable to endure so great a conflict. About ten of these proved abortions,<SUP><A HREF="#P2770_1331583">21</A></SUP> causing us great grief and sorrow beyond measure, and impairing the zeal of the others who had not yet been seized, but who, though suffering all kinds of affliction, continued constantly with the witnesses and did not forsake them.</P>

<P>12 Then all of us feared greatly on account of uncertainty as to their confession; not because we dreaded the sufferings to be endured, but because we looked to the end, and were afraid that some of them might fall away.</P>

<P>13 But those who were worthy were seized day by day, filling up their number, so that all the zealous persons, and those through whom especially our affairs had been established, were collected together out of the two churches.</P>

<P>14 And some of our heathen servants also were seized, as the governor had commanded that all of us should be examined publicly. These, being ensnared by Satan, and fearing for themselves the tortures which they beheld the saints endure,<SUP><A HREF="#P2774_1332825">22</A></SUP> and being also urged on by the soldiers, accused us falsely of Thyestean banquets and Oedipodean intercourse,<SUP><A HREF="#P2775_1333528">23</A></SUP> and of deeds which are not only unlawful for us to speak of or to think, but which we cannot believe were ever done by men.</P>

<P>15 When these accusations were reported, all the people raged like wild beasts against us, so that even if any had before been moderate on account of friendship, they were now exceedingly furious and gnashed their teeth against us. And that which was spoken by our Lord was fulfilled: `The time will come when whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.'<SUP><A HREF="#P2777_1334351">24</A></SUP> </P>

<P>16 Then finally the holy witnesses endured sufferings beyond description, Satan striving earnestly that some of the slanders might be uttered by them also?<SUP><A HREF="#P2779_1334525">25</A></SUP> </P>

<P>17 "But the whole wrath of the populace, and governor, and soldiers was aroused exceedingly against Sanctus, the deacon from Vienne,<SUP><A HREF="#P2781_1334930">26</A></SUP> and Maturus, a late convert, yet a noble combatant, and against Attalus, a native of Pergamos<SUP><A HREF="#P2782_1335515">27</A></SUP> where he had always been a pillar and foundation, and Blandina, through whom Christ showed that things which appear mean and obscure and despicable to men are with God of great glory,<SUP><A HREF="#P2783_1335944">28</A></SUP> through love toward him manifested in power, and not boasting in appearance.</P>

<P>18 For while we all trembled, and her earthly mistress, who was herself also one of the witnesses, feared that on account of the weakness of her body, she would be unable to make bold confession, Blandina was filled with such power as to be delivered and raised above those who were torturing her by turns from morning till evening in every manner, so that they acknowledged that they were conquered, and could do nothing more to her. And they were astonished at her endurance, as her entire body was mangled and broken; and they testified that one of these forms of torture was sufficient to destroy life, not to speak of so many and so great sufferings.</P>

<P>19 But the blessed woman, like a noble athlete, renewed her strength in her confession; and her comfort and recreation and relief from the pain of her sufferings was in exclaiming, `I am a Christian, and there is nothing vile done by us.'</P>

<P>20 "But Sanctus also endured marvelously and superhumanly<SUP><A HREF="#P2787_1337009">29</A></SUP> all the outrages which he suffered. While the wicked men hoped, by the continuance and severity of his tortures to wring something from him which he ought not to say, he girded himself against them with such firmness that he would not even tell his name, or the nation or city to which he belonged, or whether he was bond or free, but answered in the Roman tongue to all their questions, `I am a Christian.' He confessed this instead of name and city and race and everything besides, and the people heard from him no other word.</P>

<P>21 There arose therefore on the part of the governor and his tormentors a great desire to conquer him; but having nothing more that they could do to him, they finally fastened red-hot brazen plates to the most tender parts of his body.</P>

<P>22 And these indeed were burned, but he continued unbending and unyielding, firm in his confession, and refreshed and strengthened by the heavenly fountain of the water of life, flowing from the bowels of Christ.</P>

<P>23 And his body was a witness of his sufferings, being one complete wound and bruise, drawn out of shape, and altogether unlike a human form. Christ, suffering in him, manifested his glory, delivering him from his adversary, and making him an ensample for the others, showing that nothing is fearful where the love of the Father is, and nothing painful where there is the glory of Christ.</P>

<P>24 For when the wicked men tortured him a second time after some days, supposing that with his body swollen and inflamed to such a degree that he could not bear the touch of a hand, if they should again apply the same instruments, they would overcome him, or at least by his death under his sufferings others would be made afraid, not only did not this occur, but, contrary to all human expectation, his body arose and stood erect in the midst of the subsequent torments, and resumed its original appearance and the use of its limbs, so that, through the grace of Christ, these second sufferings became to him, not torture, but healing.</P>

<P>25 "But the devil, thinking that he had already consumed Biblias, who was one of those who had denied Christ, desiring to increase her condemnation through the utterance of blasphemy,<SUP><A HREF="#P2793_1339218">30</A></SUP> brought her again to the torture, to compel her, as already feeble and weak, to report impious things concerning us.</P>

<P>26 But she recovered herself under the suffering, and as if awaking from a deep sleep, and reminded by the present anguish of the eternal punishment in hell, she contradicted the blasphemers. `How,' she said, `could those eat children who do not think it lawful to taste the blood even of irrational animals?' And thenceforward she confessed herself a Christian, and was given a place in the order of the witnesses.</P>

<P>27"But as the tyrannical tortures were made by Christ of none effect through the patience of the blessed, the devil invented other contrivances,-confinement in the dark and most loathsome parts of the prison, stretching of the feet to the fifth hole in the stocks,<SUP><A HREF="#P2796_1340198">31</A></SUP> and the other outrages which his servants are accustomed to inflict upon the prisoners when furious and filled with the devil. A great many were suffocated in prison, being chosen by the Lord for this manner of death, that he might manifest in them his glory.</P>

<P>28 For some, though they had been tortured so cruelly that it seemed impossible that they could live, even with the most careful nursing, yet, destitute of human attention, remained in the prison, being strengthened by the Lord, and invigorated both in body and soul; and they exhorted and encouraged the rest. But such as were young, and arrested recently, so that their bodies had not become accustomed to torture, were unable to endure the severity of their confinement, and died in prison. 29 "The blessed Pothinus, who had been entrusted with the bishopric of Lyons, was dragged to the judgment seat. He was more than ninety years of age, and very infirm, scarcely indeed able to breathe because of physical weakness; but he was strengthened by spiritual zeal through his earnest desire for martyrdom. Though his body was worn out by old age and disease, his life was preserved that Christ might triumph in it.</P>

<P>30 When he was brought by the soldiers to the tribunal, accompanied by the civil magistrates and a multitude who shouted against him in every manner as if he were Christ himself, he bore noble witness.</P>

<P>31 Being asked by the governor, Who was the God of the Christians, he replied, `If thou art worthy, thou shalt know.' Then he was dragged away harshly, and received blows of every kind. Those near him struck him with their hands and feet, regardless of his age; and those at a distance hurled at him whatever they could seize; all of them thinking that they would be guilty of great wickedness and impiety if any possible abuse were omitted. For thus they thought to avenge their own deities. Scarcely able to breathe, he was cast into prison and died after two days.</P>

<P>32 "Then a certain great dispensation of God occurred, and the compassion of Jesus appeared beyond measure,<SUP><A HREF="#P2801_1342284">32</A></SUP> in a manner rarely seen among the brotherhood, but not beyond the power of Christ.</P>

<P>33 For those who had recanted at their first arrest were imprisoned with the others, and endured terrible sufferings, so that their denial was of no profit to them even for the present. But those who confessed what they were were imprisoned as Christians, no other accusation being brought against them. But the first were treated afterwards as murderers and defiled, and were punished twice as severely as the others.</P>

<P>34 For the joy of martyrdom, and the hope of the promises, and love for Christ, and the Spirit of the Father supported the latter; but their consciences so greatly distressed the former that they were easily distinguishable from all the rest by their very countenances when they were led forth.</P>

<P>35 For the first went out rejoicing, glory and grace being blended in their faces, so that even their bonds seemed like beautiful ornaments, as those of a bride adorned with variegated golden fringes; and they were perfumed with the sweet savor of Christ,<SUP><A HREF="#P2805_1343664">33</A></SUP> so that some supposed they had been anointed with earthly ointment. But the others were downcast and humble and dejected and filled with every kind of disgrace, and they were reproached by the heathen as ignoble and weak, bearing the accusation of murderers, and having lost the one honorable and glorious and life-giving Name. The rest, beholding this, were strengthened, and when apprehended, they confessed without hesitation, paying no attention to the persuasions of the devil."</P>

<P>36 After certain other words they continue:</P>

<P>"After these things, finally, their martyrdoms (were divided into every form.<SUP><A HREF="#P2808_1344331">34</A></SUP> For plaiting a crown of various colors and of all kinds of flowers, they presented it to the Father. It was proper therefore that the noble athletes, having endured a manifold strife, and conquered grandly, should receive the crown, great and incorruptible.</P>

<P>37 "Maturus, therefore, and Sanctus and Blandina and Attalus were led to the amphitheater to be exposed to the wild beasts, and to give to the heathen public a spectacle of cruelty, a day for fighting with wild beasts being specially appointed on account of our people.</P>

<P>38 Both Maturus and Sanctus passed again through every torment in the amphitheater, as if they had suffered nothing before, or rather, as if, having already conquered their antagonist in many contests,<SUP><A HREF="#P2811_1345138">35</A></SUP> they were now striving for the crown itself. They endured again the customary running of the gauntlet<SUP><A HREF="#P2812_1345344">36</A></SUP> and the violence of the wild beasts, and everything which the furious people called for or desired, and at last, the iron chair in which their bodies being roasted, tormented them with the fumes.</P>

<P>39 And not with this did the persecutors cease, but were yet more mad against them, determined to overcome their patience. But even thus they did not hear a word from Sanctus except the confession which he had uttered from the beginning.</P>

<P>40 These, then, after their life had continued for a long time through the great conflict, were at last sacrificed, having been made throughout that day a spectacle to the world, in place of the usual variety of combats.</P>

<P>41 "But Blandina was suspended on a stake, and exposed to be devoured by the wild beasts who should attack her.<SUP><A HREF="#P2816_1346389">37</A></SUP> And because she appeared as if hanging on a cross, and because of her earnest prayers, she inspired the combatants with great zeal. For they looked on her in her conflict, and beheld with their outward eyes, in the form of their sister, him who was crucified for them, that he might persuade those who believe on him, that every one who suffers for the glory of Christ has fellowship always with the living God.</P>

<P>42 As none of the wild beasts at that time touched her, she was taken down from the stake, and cast again into prison. She was preserved thus for another contest, that, being victorious in more conflicts, she might make the punishment of the crooked serpent irrevocable;<SUP><A HREF="#P2818_1347344">38</A></SUP> and, though small and weak and despised, yet clothed with Christ the mighty and conquering Athlete, she might arouse the zeal of the brethren, and, having overcome the adversary many times might receive, through her conflict, the crown incorruptible.</P>

<P>43 "But Attalus was called for loudly by the people, because he was a person of distinction. He entered the contest readily on account of a good conscience and his genuine practice in Christian discipline, and as he had always been a witness for the truth among us.</P>

<P>44 He was led around the amphitheater, a tablet being carried before him on which was written in the Roman language `This is Attalus the Christian,' and the people were filled with indignation against him. But when the governor learned that he was a Roman, he commanded him to be taken back with the rest of those who were in prison concerning whom he had written to Caear, and whose answer he was awaiting.</P>

<P>45 "But the intervening time was not wasted nor fruitless to them; for by their patience the measureless compassion of Christ was manifested. For through their continued life the dead were made alive, and the witnesses showed favor to those who had failed to witness. And the virgin mother had much joy in receiving alive those whom she had brought forth as dead.<SUP><A HREF="#P2822_1348695">39</A></SUP> </P>

<P>46 For through their influence many who had denied were restored, and re-begotten, and rekindled with life, and learned to confess. And being made alive and strengthened, they went to the judgment seat to be again interrogated by the governor; God, who desires not the death of the sinner,<SUP><A HREF="#P2824_1349031">40</A></SUP> but mercifully invites to repentance, treating them with kindness.</P>

<P>47 For Caesar commanded that they should be put to death,<SUP><A HREF="#P2826_1349178">41</A></SUP> but that any who might deny should be set free. Therefore, at the beginning of the public festival<SUP><A HREF="#P2827_1349500">42</A></SUP> which took place there, and which was attended by crowds of men from all nations, the governor brought the blessed ones to the judgment seat, to make of them a show and spectacle for the multitude. Wherefore also he examined them again, and beheaded those who appeared to possess Roman citizenship, but he sent the others to the wild beasts.</P>

<P>48 "And Christ was glorified greatly in those who had formerly denied him, for, contrary to the expectation of the heathen, they confessed. For they were examined by themselves, as about to be set free; but confessing, they were added to the order of the witnesses. But some continued without, who had never possessed a trace of faith, nor any apprehension of the wedding garment,<SUP><A HREF="#P2829_1350541">43</A></SUP> nor an understanding of the fear of God; but, as sons of perdition, they blasphemed the Way through their apostasy.</P>

<P>49 But all the others were added to the Church. While these were being examined, a certain Alexander, a Phrygian by birth, and physician by profession, who had resided in Gaul for many years, and was well known to all on account of his love to God and boldness of speech (for he was not without a share of apostolic grace), standing before the judgment seat, and by signs encouraging them to confess, appeared to those standing by as if in travail.</P>

<P>50 But the people being enraged because those who formerly denied now confessed, cried out against Alexander as if he were the cause of this. Then the governor summoned him and inquired who he was. And when he answered that he was a Christian, being very angry he condemned him to the wild beasts. And on the next day he entered along with Attalus. For to please the people, the governor had ordered Attalus again to the wild beasts.</P>

<P>51 And they were tortured in the amphitheater with all the instruments contrived for that purpose, and having endured a very great conflict, were at last sacrificed. Alexander neither groaned nor murmured in any manner, but communed in his heart with God.</P>

<P>52 But when Attalus was placed in the iron seat, and the fumes arose from his burning body, he said to the people in the Roman language: `Lo! this which ye do is devouring men; but we do not devour men; nor do any other wicked thing.' And being asked, what name God has, he replied, `God has not a name as man has.'</P>

<P>53 "After all these, on the last day of the contests, Blandina was again brought in, with Ponticus, a boy about fifteen years old. They had been brought every day to witness the sufferings of the others, and had been pressed to swear by the idols. But because they remained steadfast and despised them, the multitude became furious, so that they had no compassion for the youth of the boy nor respect for the sex of the woman.</P>

<P>54 Therefore they exposed them to all the terrible sufferings and took them through the entire round of torture, repeatedly urging them to swear, but being unable to effect this; for Ponticus, encouraged by his sister so that even the heathen could see that she was confirming and strengthening him, having nobly endured every torture, gave up the ghost. </P>

<P>55 But the blessed Blandina, last of all, having, as a noble mother, encouraged her children and sent them before her victorious to the King, endured herself all their conflicts and hastened after them, glad and rejoicing in her departure as if called to a marriage supper, rather than cast to wild beasts.</P>

<P>56 And, after the scourging, after the wild beasts, after the roasting seat,<SUP><A HREF="#P2838_1353300">44</A></SUP> she was finally enclosed in a net, and thrown before a bull. And having been tossed about by the animal, but feeling none of the things which were happening to her, on account of her hope and firm hold upon what had been entrusted to her, and her communion with Christ, she also was sacrificed. And the heathen themselves confessed that never among them had a woman endured so many and such terrible tortures.</P>

<P>57 "But not even thus was their madness and cruelty toward the saints satisfied. For, incited by the Wild Beast, wild and barbarous tribes were not easily appeased, and their violence found another peculiar opportunity in the dead bodies<SUP><A HREF="#P2840_1354125">45</A></SUP> </P>

<P>58 For, through their lack of manly reason, the fact that they had been conquered did not put them to shame, but rather the more enkindled their wrath as that of a wild beast, and aroused alike the hatred of governor and people to treat us unjustly; that the Scripture might be fulfilled: `He that is lawless, let him be lawless still, and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still.'<SUP><A HREF="#P2842_1354855">46</A></SUP> </P>

<P>59 For they cast to the dogs those who had died of suffocation in the prison, carefully guarding them by night and day, lest any one should be buried by us. And they exposed the remains left by the wild beasts and by fire, mangled and charred, and placed the heads of the others by their bodies, and guarded them in like manner from burial by a watch of soldiers for many days.</P>

<P>60 And some raged and gnashed their teeth against them, desiring to execute more severe vengeance upon them; but others laughed and mocked at them, magnifying their own idols, and imputed to them the punishment of the Christians. Even the more reasonable, and those who had seemed to sympathize somewhat, reproached them often, saying, `Where is their God, and what has their religion, which they have chosen rather than life, profited them?'</P>

<P>61 So various was their conduct toward us; but we were in deep affliction because we could not bury the bodies. For neither did night avail us for this purpose, nor did money persuade, nor entreaty move to compassion; but they kept watch in every way, as if the prevention of the burial would be of some great advantage to them."</P>

<P>In addition, they say after other things:</P>

<P>62 "The bodies of the martyrs, having thus in every manner been exhibited and exposed for six days, were afterward burned and reduced to ashes, and swept into the Rhone by the wicked men, so that no trace of them might appear on the earth.</P>

<P>63 And this they did, as if able to conquer God, and prevent their new birth; `that,' as they said, `they may have no hope of a resurrection,<SUP><A HREF="#P2849_1356539">47</A></SUP> through trust in which they bring to us this foreign and new religion, and despise terrible things, and are ready even to go to death with joy. Now let us see if they will rise again, and if their God is able to help them, and to deliver them out of our hands.'"</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter II. <I>The Martyrs, Beloved of God, Kindly Ministered Unto Those Who Fell in the Persecution.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 Such things happened to the churches of Christ under the above-mentioned emperor,<SUP><A HREF="#P2853_1357695">48</A></SUP> from which we may reasonably conjecture the occurrences in the other provinces. It is proper to add other selections from the same letter, in which the moderation and compassion of these witnesses is recorded in the following words:</P>

<P>2 "They were also so zealous in their imitation of Christ,-`who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God,'<SUP><A HREF="#P2855_1358308">49</A></SUP> -that, though they had attained such honor, and had borne witness, not once or twice, but many times,-having been brought back to prison from the wild beasts, covered with burns and scars and wounds,-yet they did not proclaim themselves witnesses, nor did they suffer us to address them by this name. If any one of us, in letter or conversation, spoke of them as witnesses, they rebuked him sharply.</P>

<P>3 For they conceded cheerfully the appellation of Witness to Christ `the faithful and true Witness,'<SUP><A HREF="#P2857_1358827">50</A></SUP> and `firstborn of the dead,'<SUP><A HREF="#P2858_1358875">51</A></SUP> and prince of the life of God;<SUP><A HREF="#P2859_1358922">52</A></SUP> and they reminded us of the witnesses who had already departed, and said, `They are already witnesses whom Christ has deemed worthy to be taken up in their confession, having sealed their testimony by their departure; but we are lowly and humble confessors.'<SUP><A HREF="#P2860_1359230">53</A></SUP> And they besought the brethren with tears that earnest prayers should be offered that they might be made perfect.<SUP><A HREF="#P2861_1359454">54</A></SUP> </P>

<P>4 They showed in their deeds the power of `testimony,' manifesting great boldness toward all the brethren, and they made plain their nobility through patience and fearlessness and courage, but they refused the title of Witnesses as distinguishing them from their brethren,<SUP><A HREF="#P2863_1359915">55</A></SUP> being filled with the fear of God."</P>

<P>5 A little further on they say: "They humbled themselves under the mighty hand, by which they are now greatly exalted.<SUP><A HREF="#P2865_1360094">56</A></SUP> They defended all,<SUP><A HREF="#P2866_1360139">57</A></SUP> but accused none. They absolved all, but bound none.<SUP><A HREF="#P2867_1360910">58</A></SUP> And they prayed for those who had inflicted cruelties upon them, even as Stephen, the perfect witness, `Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.'<SUP><A HREF="#P2868_1361383">59</A></SUP> But if he prayed for those who stoned him, how much more for the brethren!"</P>

<P>6 And again after mentioning other matters, they say:</P>

<P> "For, through the genuineness of their love, their greatest contest with him was that the Beast, being choked, might cast out alive those whom he supposed he had swallowed. For they did not boast over the fallen, but helped them in their need with those things in which they themselves abounded, having the compassion of a mother, and shedding many tears on their account before the Father.</P>

<P>7 They asked for life, and he gave it to them, and they shared it with their neighbors. Victorious over everything, they departed to God. Having always loved peace, and having commended peace to us<SUP><A HREF="#P2872_1362119">60</A></SUP> they went in peace to God, leaving no sorrow to their mother, nor division or strife to the brethren, but joy and peace and concord and love."</P>

<P>8 This record of the affection of those blessed ones toward the brethren that had fallen may be profitably added on account of the inhuman and unmerciful disposition of those who, after these events, acted unsparingly toward the members of Christ.<SUP><A HREF="#P2874_1362755">61</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter III. <I>The Vision Which Appeared in a Dream to the Witness Attalus.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 The same letter of the above-mentioned witnesses contains another account worthy of remembrance. No one will object to our bringing it to the knowledge of our readers. It runs as follows: "For a certain Alcibiades,<SUP><A HREF="#P2878_1363274">62</A></SUP> who was one of them, led a very austere life, partaking of nothing whatever but bread and water. When he endeavored to continue this same sort of life in prison, it was revealed to Attalus after his first conflict in the amphitheater that Alcibiades was not doing well in refusing the creatures of God and placing a stumbling-block before others.</P>

<P>3 And Alcibiades obeyed, and partook of all things without restraint, giving thanks to God. For they were not deprived of the grace of God, but the Holy Ghost was their counselor." Let this suffice for these matters.</P>

<P>4 The followers of Montanus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2881_1364408">63</A></SUP> Alcibiades<SUP><A HREF="#P2882_1364480">64</A></SUP> and Theodotus<SUP><A HREF="#P2883_1365113">65</A></SUP> in Phrygia were now first giving wide circulation to their assumption in regard to prophecy,-for the many other miracles that, through the gift of God, were still wrought in the different churches caused their prophesying to be readily credited by many,-and as dissension arose concerning them, the brethren in Gaul set forth their own prudent and most orthodox judgment in the matter, and published also several epistles from the witnesses that had been put to death among them. These they sent, while they were still in prison, to the brethren throughout Asia and Phrygia, and also to Eleutherus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2884_1365831">66</A></SUP> who was then bishop of Rome, negotiating for the peace of the churches.<SUP><A HREF="#P2885_1365957">67</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IV. <I>Irenaeus Commended by the Witnesses in a Letter.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 The same witnesses also recommended Irenaeus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2889_1368534">68</A></SUP> who was already at that time a presbyter of the parish of Lyons, to the above-mentioned bishop of Rome, saying many favorable things in regard to him, as the following extract shows:</P>

<P>2 "We pray, father Eleutherus, that you may rejoice in God in all things and always. We have requested our brother and comrade Irenaeus to carry this letter to you, and we ask you to hold him in esteem, as zealous for the covenant of Christ. For if we thought that office could confer righteousness upon any one, we should commend him among the first as a presbyter of the church, which is his position."</P>

<P>3 Why should we transcribe the catalogue of the witnesses given in the letter already mentioned, of whom some were beheaded, others cast to the wild beasts, and others fell asleep in prison, or give the number of confessors<SUP><A HREF="#P2892_1369399">69</A></SUP> still surviving at that time? For whoever desires can readily find the full account by consulting the letter itself, which, as I have said, is recorded in our Collection of Martyrdoms.<SUP><A HREF="#P2893_1369898">70</A></SUP> Such were the events which happened under Antoninus.<SUP><A HREF="#P2894_1370063">71</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2896_1370211"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter V. <I>God Sent Rain from Heaven for Marcus Aurelius Caesar in Answer to the Prayers of Our People.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 It is reported<SUP><A HREF="#P2898_1370332">72</A></SUP> that Marcus Aurelius Caesar, brother of Antoninus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2899_1371607">73</A></SUP> being about to engage in battle with the Germans and Sarmatians, was in great trouble on account of his army suffering from thirst.<SUP><A HREF="#P2900_1371936">74</A></SUP> But the soldiers of the so-called Melitene legion,<SUP><A HREF="#P2901_1373549">75</A></SUP> through the faith which has given strength from that time to the present, when they were drawn up before the enemy, kneeled on the ground, as is our custom in prayer,<SUP><A HREF="#P2902_1373858">76</A></SUP> and engaged in supplications to God.</P>

<P>2 This was indeed a strange sight to the enemy, but it is reported<SUP><A HREF="#P2904_1374582">77</A></SUP> that a stranger thing immediately followed. The lightning drove the enemy to flight and destruction, but a shower refreshed the army of those who had called on God, all of whom had been on the point of perishing with thirst.</P>

<P>3 This story is related by non-Christian writers who have been pleased to treat the times referred to, and it has also been recorded by our own people.<SUP><A HREF="#P2906_1374994">78</A></SUP> By those historians who were strangers to the faith, the marvel is mentioned, but it is not acknowledged as an answer to our prayers. But by our own people, as friends of the truth, the occurrence is related in a simple and artless manner.</P>

<P>4 Among these is Apolinarius,<SUP><A HREF="#P2908_1376048">79</A></SUP> who says that from that time the legion through whose prayers the wonder took place received from the emperor a title appropriate to the event, being called in the language of the Romans the Thundering Legion.</P>

<P>5 Tertullian is a trustworthy witness of these things. In the Apology for the Faith, which he addressed to the Roman Senate, and which work we have already mentioned,<SUP><A HREF="#P2910_1378020">80</A></SUP> he confirms the history with greater and stronger proofs.</P>

<P>6 He writes<SUP><A HREF="#P2912_1378184">81</A></SUP> that there are still extant letters<SUP><A HREF="#P2913_1378240">82</A></SUP> of the most intelligent Emperor Marcus in which he testifies that his army, being on the point of perishing with thirst in Germany, was saved by the prayers of the Christians. And he says also that this emperor threatened death<SUP><A HREF="#P2914_1379048">83</A></SUP> to those who brought accusation against us.</P>

<P>7 He adds further:<SUP><A HREF="#P2916_1379541">84</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"What kind of laws are those which impious, unjust, and cruel persons use against us alone? which Vespasian, though he had conquered the Jews, did not regard;<SUP><A HREF="#P2918_1379717">85</A></SUP> which Trajan partially annulled, forbidding Christians to be sought after;<SUP><A HREF="#P2919_1379828">86</A></SUP> which neither Adrian,<SUP><A HREF="#P2920_1379979">87</A></SUP> though inquisitive in all matters, nor he who was called Pius<SUP><A HREF="#P2921_1380118">88</A></SUP> sanctioned." But let any one treat these things as he chooses;<SUP><A HREF="#P2922_1380254">89</A></SUP> we must pass on to what followed.</P>

<P>8 Pothinus having died with the other martyrs in Gaul at ninety years of age,<SUP><A HREF="#P2924_1380955">90</A></SUP> Irenaeus succeeded him in the episcopate of the church at Lyons.<SUP><A HREF="#P2925_1381050">91</A></SUP> We have learned that, in his youth, he was a hearer of Polycarp.<SUP><A HREF="#P2926_1381165">92</A></SUP> </P>

<P>9 In the third book of his work Against Heresies he has inserted a list of the bishops of Rome, bringing it down as far as Eleutherus (whose times we are now considering), under whom he composed his work. He writes as follows:<SUP><A HREF="#P2928_1381458">93</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2930_1381485"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VI. <I>Catalogue of the Bishops of Rome.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 "The blessed apostles<SUP><A HREF="#P2932_1381555">94</A></SUP> having founded and established the church, entrusted the office of the episcopate to Linus.<SUP><A HREF="#P2933_1381760">95</A></SUP> Paul speaks of this Linus in his Epistles to Timothy.<SUP><A HREF="#P2934_1381936">96</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2 Anencletus<SUP><A HREF="#P2936_1381969">97</A></SUP> succeeded him, and after Anencletus, in the third place from the apostles, Clement<SUP><A HREF="#P2937_1382110">98</A></SUP> received the episcopate. He had seen and conversed with the blessed apostles,<SUP><A HREF="#P2938_1382243">99</A></SUP> and their preaching was still sounding in his ears, and their tradition was still before his eyes. Nor was he alone in this, for many who had been taught by the apostles yet survived.</P>

<P>3 In the times of Clement, a serious dissension having arisen among the brethren in Corinth,<SUP><A HREF="#P2940_1382787">100</A></SUP> the church of Rome sent a most suitable letter to the Corinthians,<SUP><A HREF="#P2941_1382923">101</A></SUP> reconciling them in peace, renewing their faith, and proclaiming<SUP><A HREF="#P2942_1383051">102</A></SUP> the doctrine lately received from the apostles."<SUP><A HREF="#P2943_1383946">103</A></SUP> </P>

<P>4 A little farther on he says:<SUP><A HREF="#P2945_1384296">104</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"Evarestus<SUP><A HREF="#P2947_1384320">105</A></SUP> succeeded Clement, and Alexander,<SUP><A HREF="#P2948_1384415">106</A></SUP> Evarestus. Then Xystus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2949_1384491">107</A></SUP> the sixth from the apostles, was appointed. After him Telesphorus,<SUP><A HREF="#P2950_1384597">108</A></SUP> who suffered martyrdom gloriously; then Hyginus;<SUP><A HREF="#P2951_1384691">109</A></SUP> then Pius;<SUP><A HREF="#P2952_1384743">110</A></SUP> and after him Anicetus;<SUP><A HREF="#P2953_1384806">111</A></SUP> Soter<SUP><A HREF="#P2954_1384855">112</A></SUP> succeeded Anicetus; and now, in the twelfth place from the apostles, Eleutherus<SUP><A HREF="#P2955_1384974">113</A></SUP> holds the office of bishop.</P>

<P>5 In the same order and succession<SUP><A HREF="#P2957_1385094">114</A></SUP> the tradition in the Church and the preaching of the truth has descended from the apostles unto us."</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VII. <I>Even Down to Those Times Miracles Were Performed by the Faithful.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 These things Irenaeus, in agreement with the accounts already given by us,<SUP><A HREF="#P2961_1385720">115</A></SUP> records in the work which comprises five books, and to which he gave the title Refutation and Overthrow of the Knowledge Falsely So-called.<SUP><A HREF="#P2962_1385941">116</A></SUP> In the second book of the same treatise he shows that manifestations of divine and miraculous power continued to his time in some of the churches.</P>

<P>2 He says:<SUP><A HREF="#P2964_1387145">117</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"But so far do they come short of raising the dead, as the Lord raised them, and the apostles through prayer. And oftentimes in the brotherhood, when, on account of some necessity, our entire Church has besought with fasting and much supplication, the spirit of the dead has returned,<SUP><A HREF="#P2966_1389149">118</A></SUP> and the man has been restored through the prayers of the saints."</P>

<P>3 And again, after other remarks, he says:<SUP><A HREF="#P2968_1389287">119</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"If they will say that even the Lord did these things in mere appearance, we will refer them to the prophetic writings, and show from them that all things were beforehand spoken of him in this manner, and were strictly fulfilled; and that he alone is the Son of God. Wherefore his true disciples, receiving grace from him, perform such works in his Name for the benefit of other men, as each has received the gift from him.</P>

<P>4 For some of them drive out demons effectually and truly, so that those who have been cleansed from evil spirits frequently believe and unite with the Church. Others have a foreknowledge of future events, and visions, and prophetic revelations. Still others heal the sick by the laying on of hands, and restore them to health. And, as we have said, even dead persons have been raised, and remained with us many years.</P>

<P>5 But why should we say more? It is not possible to recount the number of gifts which the Church, throughout all the world, has received from God in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and exercises every day for the benefit of the heathen, never deceiving any nor doing it for money. For as she has received freely from God, freely also does she minister."<SUP><A HREF="#P2972_1390546">120</A></SUP> </P>

<P>6 And in another place the same author writes:<SUP><A HREF="#P2974_1390616">121</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"As also we hear that many brethren in the Church possess prophetic gifts, and speak, through the Spirit, with all kinds of tongues, and bring to light the secret things of men for their good, and declare the mysteries of God."</P>

<P>So much in regard to the fact that various gifts remained among those who were worthy even until that time.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VIII. <I>The Statements of Irenaeus in Regard to the Divine Scriptures.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 Since, in the beginning of this work,<SUP><A HREF="#P2980_1391093">122</A></SUP> we promised to give, when needful, the words of the ancient presbyters and writers of the Church, in which they have declared those traditions which came down to them concerning the canonical books, and since Irenaeus was one of them, we will now give his words and, first, what he says of the sacred Gospels:<SUP><A HREF="#P2981_1391861">123</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2 "Matthew published his Gospel among the Hebrews in their own language,<SUP><A HREF="#P2983_1391963">124</A></SUP> while Peter and Paul were preaching and founding the churchin Rome.<SUP><A HREF="#P2984_1392822">125</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3 After their departure Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, also transmitted to us in writing those things which Peter had preached;<SUP><A HREF="#P2986_1393009">126</A></SUP> and Luke, the attendant of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel which Paul had declared.<SUP><A HREF="#P2987_1393141">127</A></SUP> </P>

<P>4 Afterwards John, the disciple of the Lord, who also reclined on his bosom, published his Gospel, while staying at Ephesus in Asia."<SUP><A HREF="#P2989_1393320">128</A></SUP> </P>

<P>5 He states these things in the third book of his above-mentioned work. In the fifth book he speaks as follows concerning the Apocalypse of John, and the number of the name of Antichrist:<SUP><A HREF="#P2991_1393553">129</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"As these things are so, and this number is found in all the approved and ancient copies,<SUP><A HREF="#P2993_1393681">130</A></SUP> and those who saw John face to face confirm it, and reason teaches us that the number of the name of the beast, according to the mode of calculation among the Greeks, appears in its letters. ..."<SUP><A HREF="#P2994_1394229">131</A></SUP> </P>

<P>6 And farther on he says concerning the same:<SUP><A HREF="#P2996_1394974">132</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"We are not bold enough to speak confidently of the name of Antichrist. For if it were necessary that his name should be declared clearly at the present time, it would have been announced by him who saw the revelation. For it was seen, not long ago, but almost in our generation, toward the end of the reign of Domitian."<SUP><A HREF="#P2998_1395416">133</A></SUP> </P>

<P>7 He states these things concerning the Apocalypse<SUP><A HREF="#P3000_1395512">134</A></SUP> in the work referred to. He also mentions the first Epistle of John,<SUP><A HREF="#P3001_1395641">135</A></SUP> taking many proofs from it, and likewise the first Epistle of Peter.<SUP><A HREF="#P3002_1395933">136</A></SUP> And he not only knows, but also receives, The Shepherd,<SUP><A HREF="#P3003_1396211">137</A></SUP> writing as follows:<SUP><A HREF="#P3004_1396305">138</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"Well did the Scripture<SUP><A HREF="#P3006_1396358">139</A></SUP> speak, saying,<SUP><A HREF="#P3007_1396635">140</A></SUP> `First of all believe that God is one, who has created and completed all things,'" &amp;c.</P>

<P>8 And he uses almost the precise words of the Wisdom of Solomon, saying:<SUP><A HREF="#P3009_1396832">141</A></SUP> "The vision of God produces immortality, but immortality renders us near to God." He mentions also the memoirs<SUP><A HREF="#P3010_1397173">142</A></SUP> of a certain apostolic presbyter,<SUP><A HREF="#P3011_1397417">143</A></SUP> whose name he passes by in silence, and gives his expositions of the sacred Scriptures.</P>

<P>9 And he refers to Justin the Martyr,<SUP><A HREF="#P3013_1398427">144</A></SUP> and to Ignatius,<SUP><A HREF="#P3014_1398717">145</A></SUP> using testimonies also from their writings. Moreover, he promises to refute Marcion from his own writings, in a special work.<SUP><A HREF="#P3015_1399240">146</A></SUP> </P>

<P>10 Concerning the translation of the inspired<SUP><A HREF="#P3017_1399655">147</A></SUP> Scriptures by the Seventy, hear the very words which he writes:<SUP><A HREF="#P3018_1399739">148</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"God in truth became man, and the Lord himself saved us, giving the sign of the virgin; but not as some say, who now venture to translate the Scripture, `Behold, a young woman shall conceive and bring forth a son,'<SUP><A HREF="#P3020_1399984">149</A></SUP> as Theodotion of Ephesus and Aquila of Pontus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3021_1400631">150</A></SUP> both of them Jewish proselytes, interpreted; following whom, the Ebionites say<SUP><A HREF="#P3022_1400970">151</A></SUP> that he was begotten by Joseph."</P>

<P>11 Shortly after he adds:</P>

<P>"For before the Romans had established their empire, while the Macedonians were still holding Asia, Ptolemy, the son of Lagus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3025_1401224">152</A></SUP> being desirous of adorning the library which he had founded in Alexandria with the meritorious writings of all men, requested the people of Jerusalem to have their Scriptures translated into the Greek language.</P>

<P>12 But, as they were then subject to the Macedonians, they sent to Ptolemy seventy elders, who were the most skilled among them in the Scriptures and in both languages. Thus God accomplished his purpose.<SUP><A HREF="#P3027_1404294">153</A></SUP> </P>

<P>13 But wishing to try them individually, as he feared lest, by taking counsel together, they might conceal the truth of the Scriptures by their interpretation, he separated them from one another, and commanded all of them to write the same translation.<SUP><A HREF="#P3029_1405507">154</A></SUP> He did this for all the books.</P>

<P>14 But when they came together in the presence of Ptolemy, and compared their several translations, God was glorified, and the Scriptures were recognized as truly divine. For all of them had rendered the same things in the same words and with the same names from beginning to end, so that the heathen perceived that the Scriptures had been translated by the inspiration<SUP><A HREF="#P3031_1406157">155</A></SUP> of God.</P>

<P>15 And this was nothing wonderful for God to do, who, in the captivity of the people under Nebuchadnezzar, when the Scriptures had been destroyed, and the Jews had returned to their own country after seventy years, afterwards,in the time of Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, inspired Ezra the priest, of the tribe of Levi, to relate all the words of the former prophets, and to restore to the people the legislation of Moses."<SUP><A HREF="#P3033_1406613">156</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Such are the words of Irenaeus.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter X. <I>Pantaenus the Philosopher.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 About that time, Pantaenus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3045_1408110">161</A></SUP> a man highly distinguished for his learning, had charge of the school of the faithful in Alexandria.<SUP><A HREF="#P3046_1411492">162</A></SUP> A school of sacred learning, which continues to our day, was established there in ancient times,<SUP><A HREF="#P3047_1413046">163</A></SUP> and as we have been informed,<SUP><A HREF="#P3048_1413640">164</A></SUP> was managed by men of great ability and zeal for divine things. Among these it is reported<SUP><A HREF="#P3049_1413752">165</A></SUP> that Pantaenus was at that time especially conspicuous, as he had been educated in the philosophical system of those called Stoics.</P>

<P>2 They say that he displayed such zeal for the divine Word, that he was appointed as a herald of the Gospel of Christ to the nations in the East, and was sent as far as India.<SUP><A HREF="#P3051_1414078">166</A></SUP> For indeed<SUP><A HREF="#P3052_1415679">167</A></SUP> there were still many evangelists of the Word who sought earnestly to use their inspired zeal, after the examples of the apostles, for the increase and building up of the Divine Word.</P>

<P>3 Pantaenus was one of these, and is said to have gone to India. It is reported that among persons there who knew of Christ, he found the Gospel according to Matthew, which had anticipated his own arrival. For Bartholomew,<SUP><A HREF="#P3054_1416477">168</A></SUP> one of the apostles, had preached to them, and left with them the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language,<SUP><A HREF="#P3055_1416605">169</A></SUP> which they had preserved till that time.</P>

<P>4 After many good deeds, Pantaenus finally became the head of the school at Alexandria,<SUP><A HREF="#P3057_1417298">170</A></SUP> and expounded the treasures of divine doctrine both orally and in writing.<SUP><A HREF="#P3058_1417818">171</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2 In his Hypotyposes<SUP><A HREF="#P3066_1420658">175</A></SUP> he speaks of Pantaenus by name as his teacher. It seems to me that he alludes to the same person also in the first book of his Stromata, when, referring to the more conspicuous of the successors of the apostles whom he had met,<SUP><A HREF="#P3067_1421085">176</A></SUP> he says:<SUP><A HREF="#P3068_1421583">177</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XIII. <I>Rhodo and His Account of the Dissension of Marcion.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 At this time Rhodo,<SUP><A HREF="#P3092_1431763">191</A></SUP> a native of Asia, who had been instructed, as he himself states, by Tatian, with whom we have already become acquainted,<SUP><A HREF="#P3093_1433376">192</A></SUP> having written several books, published among the rest one against the heresy of Marcion.<SUP><A HREF="#P3094_1433495">193</A></SUP> He says that this heresy was divided in his time into various opinions;<SUP><A HREF="#P3095_1433634">194</A></SUP> and while describing those who occasioned the division, he refutes accurately the falsehoods devised by each of them.</P>

<P>2 But hear what he writes:<SUP><A HREF="#P3097_1434507">195</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"Therefore also they disagree among themselves, maintaining an inconsistent opinion.<SUP><A HREF="#P3099_1434693">196</A></SUP> For Apelles,<SUP><A HREF="#P3100_1436093">197</A></SUP> one of the herd, priding himself on his manner of life<SUP><A HREF="#P3101_1438041">198</A></SUP> and his age, acknowledges one principle,<SUP><A HREF="#P3102_1438367">199</A></SUP> but says that the prophecies<SUP><A HREF="#P3103_1440246">200</A></SUP> are from an opposing spirit, being led to this view by the responses of a maiden by name Philumene,<SUP><A HREF="#P3104_1441206">201</A></SUP> who was possessed by a demon.</P>

<P>3 But others, among whom are Potitus and Basilicus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3106_1442871">202</A></SUP> hold to two principles,<SUP><A HREF="#P3107_1442988">203</A></SUP> as does the mariner<SUP><A HREF="#P3108_1443027">204</A></SUP> Marcion himself.</P>

<P>4 These following the wolf<SUP><A HREF="#P3110_1443837">205</A></SUP> of Pontus, and, like him, unable to fathom the division of things, became reckless, and without giving any proof asserted two principles. Others, again, drifting into a worse error, consider that there are not only two, but three natures.<SUP><A HREF="#P3111_1444361">206</A></SUP> Of these, Syneros<SUP><A HREF="#P3112_1444398">207</A></SUP> is the leader and chief, as those who defend his teaching<SUP><A HREF="#P3113_1444804">208</A></SUP> say."</P>

<P>5 The same author writes that he engaged in conversation with Apelles. He speaks as follows:</P>

<P>"For the old man Apelles, when conversing with us,<SUP><A HREF="#P3116_1445120">209</A></SUP> was refuted in many things which he spoke falsely; whence also he said that it was not at all necessary to examine one's doctrine,<SUP><A HREF="#P3117_1445687">210</A></SUP> but that each one should continue to hold what he believed. For he asserted that those who trusted in the Crucified would be saved, if only they were found doing good works.<SUP><A HREF="#P3118_1445879">211</A></SUP> But as we have said before, his opinion concerning God was the most obscure of all. For he spoke of one principle, as also our doctrine does."</P>

<P>6 Then, after stating fully his own opinion, he adds:</P>

<P>"When I said to him, Tell me how you know this or how can you assert that there is one principle, he replied that the prophecies refuted themselves, because they have said nothing true;<SUP><A HREF="#P3121_1448085">212</A></SUP> for they are inconsistent, and false, and self-contradictory. But how there is one principle he said that he did not know, but that he was thus persuaded.</P>

<P>7 As I then adjured him to speak the truth, he swore that he did so when he said that he did not know how there is one unbegotten God, but that he believed it. Thereupon I laughed and reproved him because, though calling himself a teacher, he knew not how to confirm what he taught."<SUP><A HREF="#P3123_1450344">213</A></SUP> </P>

<P>8 In the same work, addressing Callistio,<SUP><A HREF="#P3125_1450894">214</A></SUP> the same writer acknowledges that he had been instructed at Rome by Tatian.<SUP><A HREF="#P3126_1451187">215</A></SUP> And he says that a book of Problems<SUP><A HREF="#P3127_1451273">216</A></SUP> had been prepared by Tatian, in which he promised to explain the obscure and hidden parts of the divine Scriptures. Rhodo himself promises to give in a work of his own solutions of Tatian's problems.<SUP><A HREF="#P3128_1451528">217</A></SUP> There is also extant a Commentary of his on the Hexaemeron.<SUP><A HREF="#P3129_1451770">218</A></SUP> </P>

<P>9 But this Apelles wrote many things, an impious manner, of the law of Moses, blaspheming the divine words in many of his works, being, as it seemed, very zealous for their refutation and overthrow?<SUP><A HREF="#P3131_1452220">219</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XVI. <I>The Circumstances Related of Montanus and His False Prophets.</I><SUP><A HREF="#P3145_1454441">224</A></SUP>  </FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 Against the so-called Phrygian<SUP><A HREF="#P3147_1462171">225</A></SUP> heresy, the power which always contends for the truth raised up a strong and invincible weapon, Apolinarius of Hierapolis, whom we have mentioned before,<SUP><A HREF="#P3148_1462771">226</A></SUP> and with him many other men of ability, by whom abundant material for our history has been left.</P>

<P>2 A certain one of these, in the beginning of his work against them,<SUP><A HREF="#P3150_1463040">227</A></SUP> first intimates that he had contended with them in oral controversies. He commences his work in this manner:<SUP><A HREF="#P3151_1463460">228</A></SUP> </P>

<P>"Having for a very long and sufficient time, O beloved Avircius Marcellus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3153_1463696">229</A></SUP> been urged by you to write a treatise against the heresy of those who are called after Miltiades,<SUP><A HREF="#P3154_1464836">230</A></SUP> I have hesitated till the present time, not through lack of ability to refute the falsehood or bear testimony for the truth, but from fear and apprehension that I might seem to some to be making additions to the doctrines or precepts of the Gospel of the New Testament, which it is impossible for one who has chosen to live according to the Gospel, either to increase or to diminish.</P>

<P>But being recently in Ancyra<SUP><A HREF="#P3156_1467365">231</A></SUP> in Galatia, I found the church there<SUP><A HREF="#P3157_1467541">232</A></SUP> greatly agitated by this novelty, not prophecy, as they call it, but rather false prophecy, as will be shown. Therefore, to the best of our ability, with the Lord's help, we disputed in the church many days concerning these and other matters separately brought forward by them, so that the church rejoiced and was strengthened in the truth, and those of the opposite side were for the time confounded, and the adversaries were grieved.</P>

<P>5 The presbyters in the place, our fellow-presbyter Zoticus<SUP><A HREF="#P3159_1468561">233</A></SUP> of Otrous also being present, requested us to leave a record of what had been said against the opposers of the truth. We did not do this, but we promised to write it out as soon as the Lord permitted us, and to send it to them speedily." </P>

<P>6 Having said this with other things, in the beginning of his work, he proceeds to state the cause of the above-mentioned heresy as follows:</P>

<P>"Their opposition and their recent heresy which has separated them from the Church arose on the following account.</P>

<P>7 There is said to be a certain village called Ardabau in that part of Mysia, which borders upon Phrygia.<SUP><A HREF="#P3163_1470335">234</A></SUP> There first, they say, when Gratus was proconsul of Asia,<SUP><A HREF="#P3164_1470978">235</A></SUP> a recent convert, Montanus by name, through his unquenchable desire for leadership,<SUP><A HREF="#P3165_1472760">236</A></SUP> gave the adversary opportunity against him. And he became beside himself, and being suddenly in a sort of frenzy and ecstasy, he raved, and began to babble and utter strange things, prophesying in a manner contrary to the constant custom of the Church handed down by tradition from the beginning.<SUP><A HREF="#P3166_1473499">237</A></SUP> </P>

<P>8 Some of those who heard his spurious utterances at that time were indignant, and they rebuked him as one that was possessed, and that was under the control of a demon, and was led by a deceitful spirit, and was distracting the multitude; and they forbade him to talk, remembering the distinction<SUP><A HREF="#P3168_1476623">238</A></SUP> drawn by the Lord and his warning to guard watchfully against the coming of false prophets?<SUP><A HREF="#P3169_1476760">239</A></SUP> But others imagining themselves possessed of the Holy Spirit and of a prophetic gift,<SUP><A HREF="#P3170_1476872">240</A></SUP> were elated and not a little puffed up; and forgetting the distinction of the Lord, they challenged the mad and insidious and seducing spirit, and were cheated and deceived by him. In consequence of this, he could no longer be held in check, so as to keep silence.</P>

<P>9 Thus by artifice, or rather by such a system of wicked craft, the devil, devising destruction for the disobedient, and being unworthily honored by them, secretly excited and inflamed their understandings which had already become estranged from the true faith. And he stirred up besides two women,<SUP><A HREF="#P3172_1477484">241</A></SUP> and filled them with the false spirit, so that they talked wildly and unreasonably and strangely, like the person already mentioned.<SUP><A HREF="#P3173_1478692">242</A></SUP> And the spirit pronounced them blessed as they rejoiced and gloried in him, and puffed them up by the magnitude of his promises. But sometimes he rebuked them openly in a wise and faithful manner, that he might seem to be a reprover. But those of the Phrygians that were deceived were few in number.</P>

<P>"And the arrogant spirit taught them to revile the entire universal Church under heaven, because the spirit of false prophecy received neither honor from it nor entrance into it.</P>

<P>10 For the faithful in Asia met often in many places throughout Asia to consider this matter,<SUP><A HREF="#P3176_1479286">243</A></SUP> and examined the novel utterances and pronounced them profane, and rejected the heresy, and thus these persons were expelled from the Church and debarred from communion."</P>

<P>11 Having related these things at the outset, and continued the refutation of their delusion through his entire work, in the second book he speaks as follows of their end:</P>

<P>12 "Since, therefore, they called us slayers of the prophets<SUP><A HREF="#P3179_1480636">244</A></SUP> because we did not receive their loquacious prophets, who, they say, are those that the Lord promised to send to the people,<SUP><A HREF="#P3180_1481209">245</A></SUP> let them answer as in God's presence: Who is there, O friends, of these who began to talk, from Montanus and the women down, that was persecuted by the Jews, or slain by lawless men? None. Or has any of them been seized and crucified for the Name? Truly not. Or has one of these women ever been scourged in the synagogues of the Jews, or stoned? No; never anywhere.<SUP><A HREF="#P3181_1481602">246</A></SUP> </P>

<P>13 But by another kind of death Montanus and Maximilla are said to have died. For the report is that, incited by the spirit of frenzy, they both hung themselves;<SUP><A HREF="#P3183_1482653">247</A></SUP> not at the same time, but at the time which common report gives for the death of each. And thus they died, and ended their lives like the traitor Judas.</P>

<P>14 So also, as general report says, that remarkable person, the first steward,<SUP><A HREF="#P3185_1483124">248</A></SUP> as it were, of their so-called prophecy, one Theodotus-who, as if at sometime taken up and received into heaven, fell into trances, and entrusted himself to the deceitful spirit-was pitched like a quoit, and died miserably?<SUP><A HREF="#P3186_1484617">249</A></SUP> </P>

<P>15 They say that these things happened in this manner. But as we did not see them, O friend, we do not pretend to know. Perhaps in such a manner, perhaps not, Montanus and Theodotus and the above-mentioned woman died."</P>

<P>16 He says again in the same book that the holy bishops of that time attempted to refute the spirit in Maximilla, but were prevented by others who plainly co-operated with the spirit.</P>

<P>17 He writes as follows:</P>

<P>"And let not the spirit, in the same work of Asterius Urbanus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3191_1485769">250</A></SUP> say through Maximilla, `I am driven away from the sheep like a wolf.<SUP><A HREF="#P3192_1486761">251</A></SUP> I am not a wolf. I am word and spirit and power.' But let him show clearly and prove the power in the spirit. And by the spirit let him compel those to confess him who were then present for the purpose of proving and reasoning with the talkative spirit,-those eminent men and bishops, Zoticus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3193_1487083">252</A></SUP> from the village Comana, and Julian,<SUP><A HREF="#P3194_1487606">253</A></SUP> from Apamea, whose mouths the followers of Themiso<SUP><A HREF="#P3195_1488165">254</A></SUP> muzzled, refusing to permit the false and seductive spirit to be refuted by them."</P>

<P>18 Again in the same work, after saying other things in refutation of the false prophecies of Maximilla, he indicates the time when he wrote these accounts, and mentions her predictions in which she prophesied wars and anarchy. Their falsehood he censures in the following manner:</P>

<P>19 "And has not this been shown clearly to be false? For it is to-day more than thirteen years since the woman died, and there has been neither a partial nor general war in the world; but rather, through the mercy of God, continued peace even to the Christians."<SUP><A HREF="#P3198_1489115">255</A></SUP> These things are taken from the second book.</P>

<P>20 I will add also short extracts from the third book, in which he speaks thus against their boasts that many of them had suffered, martyrdom:</P>

<P>"When therefore they are at a loss, being refuted in all that they say, they try to take refuge in their martyrs, alleging that they have many martyrs, and that this is sure evidence of the power of the so-called prophetic spirit that is with them. But this, as it appears, is entirely fallacious.<SUP><A HREF="#P3201_1490590">256</A></SUP> </P>

<P>21 For some of the heresies have a great many martyrs; but surely we shall not on that account agree with them or confess that they hold the truth. And first, indeed, those called Marcionites, from the heresy of Marcion, say that they have a multitude of martyrs for Christ; yet they do not confess Christ himself in truth."</P>

<P>A little farther on he continues:</P>

<P>22 "When those called to martyrdom from the Church for the truth of the faith have met with any of the so-called martyrs of the Phrygian heresy, they have separated from them, and died without any fellowship with them,<SUP><A HREF="#P3205_1491656">257</A></SUP> because they did not wish to give their assent to the spirit of Montanus and the women. And that this is true and took place in our own time in Apamea on the Maeander,<SUP><A HREF="#P3206_1492788">258</A></SUP> among those who suffered martyrdom with Gaius and Alexander of Eumenia, is well known."</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XVII. <I>Miltiades and His Works.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 In this work he mentions a writer, Miltiades,<SUP><A HREF="#P3210_1493723">259</A></SUP> stating that he also wrote a certain book against the above-mentioned heresy. After quoting some of their words, he adds:</P>

<P>"Having found these things in a certain work of theirs in opposition to the work of the brother Alcibiades,<SUP><A HREF="#P3212_1499239">260</A></SUP> in which he shows that a prophet ought not to speak in ecstasy,<SUP><A HREF="#P3213_1499594">261</A></SUP> I made an abridgment."</P>

<P>2 A little further on in the same work he gives a list of those who prophesied under the new covenant, among whom he enumerates a certain Ammia<SUP><A HREF="#P3215_1500141">262</A></SUP> and Quadratus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3216_1500745">263</A></SUP> saying:</P>

<P>"But the false prophet falls into an ecstasy, in which he is without shame or fear. Beginning with purposed ignorance, he passes on, as has been stated, to involuntary madness of soul.</P>

<P>3 They cannot show that one of the old or one of the new prophets was thus carried away in spirit. Neither can they boast of Agabus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3219_1501593">264</A></SUP> or Judas,<SUP><A HREF="#P3220_1501652">265</A></SUP> or Silas,<SUP><A HREF="#P3221_1501722">266</A></SUP> or the daughters of Philip,<SUP><A HREF="#P3222_1501927">267</A></SUP> or Ammia in Philadelphia, or Quadratus, or any others not belonging to them."</P>

<P>4 And again after a little he says: "For if after Quadratus and Ammia in Philadelphia, as they assert, the women with Montanus received the prophetic gift, let them show who among them received it from Montanus and the women. For the apostle thought it necessary that the prophetic gift should continue in all the Church until the final coming. But they cannot show it, though this is the fourteenth year since the death of Maximilla."<SUP><A HREF="#P3224_1502531">268</A></SUP> </P>

<P>5 He writes thus. But the Miltiades to whom he refers has left other monuments of his own zeal for the Divine Scriptures,<SUP><A HREF="#P3226_1503716">269</A></SUP> in the discourses which he composed against the Greeks and against the Jews,<SUP><A HREF="#P3227_1503953">270</A></SUP> answering each of them separately in two books.<SUP><A HREF="#P3228_1504192">271</A></SUP> And in addition he addresses an apology to the earthly rulers,<SUP><A HREF="#P3229_1504317">272</A></SUP> in behalf of the philosophy which he embraced. </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XVIII. <I>The Manner in Which Apollonius Refuted the Phrygians, and the Persons</I><SUP><A HREF="#P3232_1504903">273</A></SUP><I> Whom He Mentions.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 As the so-called Phrygian heresy<SUP><A HREF="#P3234_1504981">274</A></SUP> was still flourishing in Phrygia in his time, Apollonius<SUP><A HREF="#P3235_1505080">275</A></SUP> also, an ecclesiastical writer, undertook its refutation, and wrote a special work against it, correcting in detail the false prophecies current among them and reproving the life of the founders of the heresy. But hear his own words respecting Montanus:</P>

<P>2 "His actions and his teaching show who this new teacher is. This is he who taught the dissolution of marriage;<SUP><A HREF="#P3237_1507559">276</A></SUP> who made laws for fasting;<SUP><A HREF="#P3238_1508185">277</A></SUP> who named Pepuza and Tymion,<SUP><A HREF="#P3239_1509457">278</A></SUP> small towns in Phrygia, Jerusalem, wishing to gather people to them from all directions; who appointed collectors of money;<SUP><A HREF="#P3240_1510821">279</A></SUP> who contrived the receiving of gifts under the name of offerings; who provided salaries for those who preached his doctrine, that its teaching might prevail through gluttony."<SUP><A HREF="#P3241_1511669">280</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3 He writes thus concerning Montanus; and a little farther on he writes as follows concerning his prophetesses: "We show that these first prophetesses themselves, as soon as they were filled with the Spirit, abandoned their husbands. How falsely therefore they speak who call Prisca a virgin."<SUP><A HREF="#P3243_1512665">281</A></SUP> </P>

<P>4 Afterwards he says: "Does not all Scripture seem to you to forbid a prophet to receive gifts and money?<SUP><A HREF="#P3245_1512801">282</A></SUP> When therefore I see the prophetess receiving gold and silver and costly garments, how can I avoid reproving her?"</P>

<P>5 And again a little farther on he speaks thus concerning one of their confessors:</P>

<P>"So also Themiso,<SUP><A HREF="#P3248_1513034">283</A></SUP> who was clothed with plausible covetousness, could not endure the sign of confession, but threw aside bonds for an abundance of possessions. Yet, though he should have been humble on this account, he dared to boast as a martyr, and in imitation of the apostle, he wrote a certain catholic<SUP><A HREF="#P3249_1513365">284</A></SUP> epistle, to instruct those whose faith was better than his own, contending for words of empty sound, and blaspheming against the Lord and the apostles and the holy Church."</P>

<P>And again concerning others of those honored among them as martyrs, he writes as follows:</P>

<P>"Not to speak of many, let the prophetess herself tell us of Alexander,<SUP><A HREF="#P3252_1514226">285</A></SUP> who called himself a martyr, with whom she is in the habit of banqueting, and who is worshiped<SUP><A HREF="#P3253_1515337">286</A></SUP> by many. We need not mention his robberies and other daring deeds for which he was punished, but the archives<SUP><A HREF="#P3254_1515588">287</A></SUP> contain them. Which of these forgives the sins of the other? Does the prophet the robberies of the martyr, or the martyr the covetousness of the prophet? For although the Lord said, `Provide neither gold, nor silver, neither two coats,'<SUP><A HREF="#P3255_1516251">288</A></SUP> these men, in complete opposition, transgress in respect to the possession of the forbidden things. For we will show that those whom they call prophets and martyrs gather their gain not only from rich men, but also from the poor, and orphans, and widows.</P>

<P>8 But if they are confident, let them stand up and discuss these matters, that if convicted they may hereafter cease transgressing. For the fruits of the prophet must be tried; `for the tree is known by its fruit.'<SUP><A HREF="#P3257_1516751">289</A></SUP> </P>

<P>9 But that those who wish may know concerning Alexander, he was tried by Aemilius Frontinus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3259_1516866">290</A></SUP> proconsul at Ephesus; not on account of the Name,<SUP><A HREF="#P3260_1517040">291</A></SUP> but for the robberies which he had committed, being already an apostate.<SUP><A HREF="#P3261_1517136">292</A></SUP> Afterwards, having falsely declared for the name of the Lord, he was released, having deceived the faithful that were there.<SUP><A HREF="#P3262_1517279">293</A></SUP> And his own parish, from which he came, did not receive him, because he was a robber.<SUP><A HREF="#P3263_1517640">294</A></SUP> Those who wish to learn about him have the public records<SUP><A HREF="#P3264_1517766">295</A></SUP> of Asia. And yet the prophet with whom he spent many years knows nothing about him!<SUP><A HREF="#P3265_1517875">296</A></SUP> </P>

<P>10 Exposing him, through him we expose also the pretense<SUP><A HREF="#P3267_1518342">297</A></SUP> of the prophet. We could show the same thing of many others. But if they are confident, let them endure the test."</P>

<P>11 Again, in another part of his work he speaks as follows of the prophets of whom they boast:</P>

<P>"If they deny that their prophets have received gifts, let them acknowledge this: that if they are convicted of receiving them, they are not prophets. And we will bring a multitude of proofs of this. But it is necessary that all the fruits of a prophet should be examined. Tell me, does a prophet dye his hair?<SUP><A HREF="#P3270_1518883">298</A></SUP> Does a prophet stain his eyelids?<SUP><A HREF="#P3271_1518934">299</A></SUP> Does a prophet delight in adornment? Does a prophet play with tables and dice? Does a prophet lend on usury? Let them confess whether these things are lawful or not; but I will show that they have been done by them."<SUP><A HREF="#P3272_1519169">300</A></SUP> </P>

<P>12 This same Apollonius states in the same work that, at the time of his writing, it was the fortieth year since Montanus had begun his pretended prophecy.<SUP><A HREF="#P3274_1519950">301</A></SUP> </P>

<P>13 And he says also that Zoticus, who was mentioned by the former writer,<SUP><A HREF="#P3276_1520083">302</A></SUP> when Maximilla was pretending to prophesy in Pepuza, resisted her and endeavored to refute the spirit that was working in her; but was prevented by those who agreed with her. He mentions also a certain Thraseas<SUP><A HREF="#P3277_1520320">303</A></SUP> among the martyrs of that time.</P>

<P>He speaks, moreover, of a tradition that the Saviour commanded his apostles not to depart from Jerusalem for twelve years.<SUP><A HREF="#P3279_1520678">304</A></SUP> He uses testimonies also from the Revelation of John,<SUP><A HREF="#P3280_1520884">305</A></SUP> and he relates that a dead man had, through the Divine power, been raised by John himself in Ephesus.<SUP><A HREF="#P3281_1521080">306</A></SUP> He also adds other things by which he fully and abundantly exposes the error of the heresy of which we have been speaking. These are the matters recorded by Apollonius.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XIX. <I>Serapion on the Heresy of the Phrygians.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 Serapion,<SUP><A HREF="#P3285_1521474">307</A></SUP> who, as report says, succeeded Maximinus<SUP><A HREF="#P3286_1524121">308</A></SUP> at that time as bishop of the church of Antioch, mentions the works of Apolinarius<SUP><A HREF="#P3287_1524255">309</A></SUP> against the above-mentioned heresy. And he alludes to him in a private letter to Caricus and Pontius,<SUP><A HREF="#P3288_1524394">310</A></SUP> in which he himself exposes the same heresy, and adds the following words:<SUP><A HREF="#P3289_1525249">311</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2 "That you may see that the doings of this lying band of the new prophecy, so called, are an abomination to all the brotherhood throughout the world, I have sent you writings<SUP><A HREF="#P3291_1525537">312</A></SUP> of the most blessed Claudius Apolinarius, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia."</P>

<P>3 In the same letter of Serapion the signatures of several bishops are found,<SUP><A HREF="#P3293_1525724">313</A></SUP> one of whom subscribes himself as follows:</P>

<P>"I, Aurelius Cyrenius, a witness,<SUP><A HREF="#P3295_1526875">314</A></SUP> pray for your health."</P>

<P>And another in this manner:</P>

<P>"Aelius Publius Julius,<SUP><A HREF="#P3298_1527225">315</A></SUP> bishop of Debeltum, a colony of Thrace. As God liveth in the heavens, the blessed Sotas in Anchialus desired to cast the demon out of Priscilla, but the hypocrites did not permit him."<SUP><A HREF="#P3299_1527563">316</A></SUP> </P>

<P>4 And the autograph signatures of many other bishops who agreed with them are contained in the same letter.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XX. <I>The Writings of Irenaeus Against the Schismatics at Rome.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 Irenaeus<SUP><A HREF="#P3305_1528116">317</A></SUP> wrote several letters against those who were disturbing the sound ordinance of the Church at Rome. One of them was to Blastus On Schism;<SUP><A HREF="#P3306_1528303">318</A></SUP> another to Florinus On Monarchy,<SUP><A HREF="#P3307_1530461">319</A></SUP> or That God is not the Author of Evil. For Florinus seemed to be defending this opinion. And because he was being drawn away by the error of Valentinus, Irenaeus wrote his work On the Ogdoad,<SUP><A HREF="#P3308_1534513">320</A></SUP> in which he shows that he himself had been acquainted with the first successors of the apostles.<SUP><A HREF="#P3309_1536150">321</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2 At the close of the treatise we have found a most beautiful note which we are constrained to insert in this work.<SUP><A HREF="#P3311_1536595">322</A></SUP> It runs as follows:</P>

<P>"I adjure thee who mayest copy this book, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by his glorious advent when he comes to judge the living and the dead, to compare what thou shalt write, and correct it carefully by this manuscript, and also to write this adjuration, and place it in the copy."</P>

<P>3 These things may be profitably read in his work, and related by us, that we may have those ancient and truly holy men as the best example of painstaking carefulness.</P>

<P>4 In the letter to Florinus, of which we have spoken,<SUP><A HREF="#P3315_1537723">323</A></SUP> Irenaeus mentions again his intimacy with Polycarp, saying:</P>

<P>"These doctrines, O Florinus, to speak mildly, are not of sound judgment. These doctrines disagree with the Church, and drive into the greatest impiety those who accept them. These doctrines, not even the heretics outside of the Church, have ever dared to publish. These doctrines, the presbyters who were before us, and who were companions of the apostles, did not deliver to thee.</P>

<P>5 "For when I was a boy, I saw thee in lower Asia with Polycarp, moving in splendor in the royal court,<SUP><A HREF="#P3318_1538343">324</A></SUP> and endeavoring to gain his approbation.</P>

<P>6 I remember the events of that time more clearly than those of recent years. For what boys learn, growing with their mind, becomes joined with it; so that I am able to describe the very place in which the blessed Polycarp sat as he discoursed, and his goings out and his comings in, and the manner ner of his life, and his physical appearance, and his discourses to the people, and the accounts which he gave of his intercourse with John and with the others who had seen the Lord. And as he remembered their words, and what he heard from them concerning the Lord, and concerning his miracles and his teaching, having received them from eyewitnesses of the `Word of life,'<SUP><A HREF="#P3320_1539617">325</A></SUP> Polycarp related all things in harmony with the Scriptures.</P>

<P>7 These things being told me by the mercy of God, I listened to them attentively, noting them down, not on paper, but in my heart. And continually, through God's grace, I recall them faithfully. And I am able to bear witness before God thatif that blessed and apostolic presbyter had heard any such thing, he would have cried out, and stopped his ears, and as was his custom, would have exclaimed, O good God, unto what times hast thou spared me that I should endure these things? And he would have fled from the place where, sitting or standing, he had heard such words.<SUP><A HREF="#P3322_1540268">326</A></SUP> </P>

<P>8 And this can be shown plainly from the letters<SUP><A HREF="#P3324_1540679">327</A></SUP> which he sent, either to the neighboring churches for their confirmation, or to some of the brethren, admonishing and exhorting them." Thus far Irenaeus.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXI. <I>How Appolonius Suffered Martyrdom at Rome.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 About the same time, in the reign of Commodus, our condition became more favorable, and through the grace of God the churches throughout the entire world enjoyed peace,<SUP><A HREF="#P3328_1541219">328</A></SUP> and the word of salvation was leading every soul, from every race of man to the devout worship of the God of the universe. So that now at Rome many who were highly distinguished for wealth and family turned with all their household and relatives unto their salvation.</P>

<P>2 But the demon who hates what is good, being malignant in his nature, could not endure this, but prepared himself again for conflict, contriving many devices against us. And he brought to the judgment seat Apollonius,<SUP><A HREF="#P3330_1541917">329</A></SUP> of the city of Rome, a man renowned among the faithful for learning and philosophy, having stirred up one of his servants, who was well fitted for such a purpose, to accuse him.<SUP><A HREF="#P3331_1543396">330</A></SUP> </P>

<P>3 But this wretched man made the charge unseasonably, because by a royal decree it was unlawful that informers of such things should live. And his legs were broken immediately, Perennius the judge having pronounced this sentence upon him.<SUP><A HREF="#P3333_1545969">331</A></SUP> </P>

<P>4 But the martyr, highly beloved of God, being earnestly entreated and requested by the judge to give an account of himself before the Senate, made in the presence of all an eloquent defense of the faith for which he was witnessing. And as if by decree of the Senate he was put to death by decapitation; an ancient law requiring that those who were brought to the judgment seat and refused to recant should not be liberated,<SUP><A HREF="#P3335_1549004">332</A></SUP> Whoever desires to know his arguments before the judge and his answers to the questions of Perennius, and his entire defense before the Senate will find them in the records of the ancient martyrdoms which we have collected.<SUP><A HREF="#P3336_1549487">333</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXII. <I>The Bishops that Were Well Known at This Time.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>In the tenth year of the reign of Commodus, Victor<SUP><A HREF="#P3340_1549687">334</A></SUP> succeeded Eleutherus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3341_1551992">335</A></SUP> the latter havingheld the episcopate for thirteen years. In the same year, after Julian<SUP><A HREF="#P3342_1552669">336</A></SUP> a had completed his tenth year, Demetrius<SUP><A HREF="#P3343_1552772">337</A></SUP> received the charge of the parishes at Alexandria. At this time the above-mentioned Serapion,<SUP><A HREF="#P3344_1553697">338</A></SUP> the eighth from the apostles, was still well known as bishop of the church at Antioch. Theophilus<SUP><A HREF="#P3345_1553855">339</A></SUP> presided at Caesarea in Palestine; and Narcissus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3346_1554778">340</A></SUP> whom we have mentioned before, still had charge of the church at Jerusalem. Bacchylus<SUP><A HREF="#P3347_1554906">341</A></SUP> at the same time was bishop of Corinth in Greece, and Polycrates<SUP><A HREF="#P3348_1556066">342</A></SUP> of the parish of Ephesus. And besides these a multitude of others, as is likely, were then prominent. But we have given the names of those alone, the soundness of whose faith has come down to us in writing.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXIII. <I>The Question Then Agitated Concerning the Passover.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 A Question of no small importance arose at that time. For the parishes of all Asia, as from an older tradition, held that the fourteenth day of the moon, on which day the Jews were commanded to sacrifice the lamb, should be observed as the feast of the Saviour's passover.<SUP><A HREF="#P3352_1558483">343</A></SUP> It was therefore necessary to end their fast on that day, whatever day of the week it should happen to be. But it was not the custom of the churches in the rest of the world to end it at this time, as they observed the practice which, from apostolic tradition, has prevailed to the present time, of terminating the fast on no other day than on that of the resurrection of our Saviour.</P>

<P>2 Synods and assemblies of bishops were held on this account,<SUP><A HREF="#P3354_1563932">344</A></SUP> and all, with one consent, through mutual correspondence drew. up an ecclesiastical decree, that the mystery of the resurrection of the Lord should be celebrated on no other but the Lord's day, and that we should observe the close of the paschal fast on this day only. There is still extant a writing of those who were then assembled in Palestine, over whom Theophilus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3355_1566709">345</A></SUP> bishop of Caesarea, and Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, presided. And there is also another writing extant of those who were assembled at Rome to consider the same question, which bears the name of Bishop Victor;<SUP><A HREF="#P3356_1567000">346</A></SUP> also of the bishops in Pontus over whom Palmas,<SUP><A HREF="#P3357_1567865">347</A></SUP> as the oldest, presided; and of the parishes in Gaul of which Irenaeus was bishop, and of those in Osrho&euml;ne<SUP><A HREF="#P3358_1568071">348</A></SUP> and the cities there; and a personal letter of Bacchylus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3359_1568198">349</A></SUP> bishop of the church at Corinth, and of a great many others, who uttered the same opinion and judgment, and cast the same vote.</P>

<P>3 And that which has been given above was their unanimous decision.<SUP><A HREF="#P3361_1568734">350</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P3363_1568793"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXIV. <I>The Disagreement in Asia.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 But the bishops of Asia, led by Polycrates, decided to hold to the old custom handed down to them.<SUP><A HREF="#P3365_1568935">351</A></SUP> He himself, in a letter which he addressed to Victor and the church of Rome, set forth in the following words the tradition which had come down to him:<SUP><A HREF="#P3366_1569216">352</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2 "We observe the exact day; neither adding, nor taking away. For in Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on the day of the Lord's coming, when he shall come with glory from heaven, and shall seek out all the saints. Among these are Philip, one of the twelve apostles, who fell asleep in Hierapolis; and his two aged virgin daughters, and another daughter, who lived in the Holy Spirit and now rests at Ephesus; and, moreover, John,who was both a witness and a teacher, who reclined upon the bosom of the Lord, and, being a priest, wore the sacerdotal plate.</P>

<P>3 He fell asleep at Ephesus.</P>

<P>4 And Polycarp<SUP><A HREF="#P3370_1570170">353</A></SUP> in Smyrna, who was a bishop and martyr; and Thraseas,<SUP><A HREF="#P3371_1570274">354</A></SUP> bishop and martyr from Eumenia, who fell asleep in Smyrna.</P>

<P>5 Why need I mention the bishop and martyr Sagaris<SUP><A HREF="#P3373_1571014">355</A></SUP> who fell asleep in Laodicea, or the blessed Papirius,<SUP><A HREF="#P3374_1571125">356</A></SUP> or Melito,<SUP><A HREF="#P3375_1571410">357</A></SUP> the Eunuch who lived altogether in the Holy Spirit, and who lies in Sardis, awaiting the episcopate from heaven, when he shall rise from the dead?</P>

<P>6 All these observed the fourteenth day of the passover according to the Gospel, deviating in no respect, but following the rule of faith.<SUP><A HREF="#P3377_1571743">358</A></SUP> And I also, Polycrates, the least of you all, do according to the tradition of my relatives, some of whom I have closely followed. For seven of my relatives were bishops; and I am the eighth. And my relatives always observed the day when the people<SUP><A HREF="#P3378_1573116">359</A></SUP> put away the leaven.</P>

<P>7 I, therefore, brethren, who have lived sixty-five years in the Lord, and have met with the brethren throughout the world, and have gone through every Holy Scripture, am not affrighted by terrifying words. For those greater than I have said `We ought to obey God rather than man.'"<SUP><A HREF="#P3380_1573793">360</A></SUP> </P>

<P>8 He then writes of all the bishops who were present with him and thought as he did. His words are as follows:</P>

<P>"I could mention the bishops who were present, whom I summoned at your desire;<SUP><A HREF="#P3383_1574001">361</A></SUP> whose names, should I write them, would constitute a great multitude. And they, beholding my littleness, gave their consent to the letter, knowing that I did not bear my gray hairs in vain, but had always governed my life by the Lord Jesus."</P>

<P>9 Thereupon Victor, who presided over the church at Rome, immediately attempted to cut off from the common unity the parishes of all Asia, with the churches that agreed with them, as heterodox; and he wrote letters and declared all the brethren there wholly excommunicate.<SUP><A HREF="#P3385_1574705">362</A></SUP> </P>

<P>10 But this did not please all the bishops. And they besought him to consider the things of peace, and of neighborly unity and love. Words of theirs are extant, sharply rebuking Victor.</P>

<P>11 Among them was Irenaeus, who, sending letters in the name of the brethren in Gaul over whom he presided, maintained that the mystery of the resurrection of the Lord should be observed only on the Lord's day. He fittingly admonishes Victor that he should not cut off whole churches of God which observed the tradition of an ancient custom and after many other words he proceeds as follows:<SUP><A HREF="#P3388_1575773">363</A></SUP> </P>

<P>12 "For the controversy is not only concerning the day, but also concerning the very manner of the fast. For some think that they should fast one day, others two, yet others more; some, moreover, count their day as consisting of forty hours day and night.<SUP><A HREF="#P3390_1576925">364</A></SUP> </P>

<P>13 And this variety in its observance has not originated in our time; but long before in that of our ancestors.<SUP><A HREF="#P3392_1577858">365</A></SUP> It is likely that they did not hold to strict accuracy, and thus formed a custom for their posterity according to their own simplicity and peculiar mode. Yet all of these lived none the less in peace, and we also live in peace with one another; and the disagreement in regard to the fast confirms the agreement in the faith."</P>

<P>14 He adds to this the following account, which I may properly insert:</P>

<P>"Among these were the presbyters before Soter, who presided over the church which thou now rulest. We mean Anicetus, and Plus, and Hyginus, and Telesphorus, and Xystus. They neither observed it<SUP><A HREF="#P3395_1580654">366</A></SUP> themselves, nor did they permit those after them to do so. And yet though not observing it, they were none the less at peace with those who came to them from the parishes in which it was observed; although this observance was more opposed to those who did not observe it.<SUP><A HREF="#P3396_1580958">367</A></SUP> </P>

<P>15 But none were ever cast out on account of this form; but the presbyters before thee who did not observe it, sent the eucharist to those of other parishes who observed it.<SUP><A HREF="#P3398_1581621">368</A></SUP> </P>

<P>16 And when the blessed Polycarp was at Rome<SUP><A HREF="#P3400_1583788">369</A></SUP> in the time of Anicetus, and they disagreed a little about certain other things, they immediately made peace with one another, not caring to quarrel over this matter. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp not to observe what he had always observed with John the disciple of our Lord, and the other apostles with whom he had associated; neither could Polycarp persuade Anicetus to observe it as he said that he ought to follow the customs of the presbyters that had preceded him.</P>

<P>17 But though matters were in this shape, they communed together, and Anicetus conceded the administration of the eucharist in the church to Polycarp, manifestly as a mark of respect.<SUP><A HREF="#P3402_1584971">370</A></SUP> And they parted from each other in peace, both those who observed, and those who did not, maintaining the peace of the whole church."</P>

<P>18 Thus Irenaeus, who truly was well named,<SUP><A HREF="#P3404_1587075">371</A></SUP> became a peacemaker in this matter, exhorting and negotiating in this way in behalf of the peace of the churches. And he conferred by letter about this mooted question, not only with Victor, but also with most of the other rulers of the churches.<SUP><A HREF="#P3405_1587407">372</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXVIII. <I>Those Who First Advanced the Heresy of Artemon; Their Manner of Life, and How They Dared to Corrupt the Sacred Scriptures.</I></FONT></P>

</UL><P>1 In a laborious work by one of thesewriters against the heresy of Artemon,<SUP><A HREF="#P3437_1602821">390</A></SUP> which Paul of Samosata<SUP><A HREF="#P3438_1609088">391</A></SUP> attempted to revive again in our day, there is an account appropriate to the history which we are now examining.</P>

<P>2 For he criticises, as a late innovation, the above-mentioned heresy which teaches that the Saviour was a mere man, because they were attempting to magnify it as ancient<SUP><A HREF="#P3440_1609437">392</A></SUP> Having given in his work many other arguments in refutation of their blasphemous falsehood, he adds the following words:</P>

<P>3 "For they say that all the early teachers and the apostles received and taught what they now declare, and that the truth of the Gospel was preserved until the times of Victor, who was the thirteenth bishop of Rome from Peter,<SUP><A HREF="#P3442_1610553">393</A></SUP> but that from his successor, Zephyrinus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3443_1610985">394</A></SUP> the truth had been corrupted.</P>

<P>4 And what they say might be plausible, if first of all the Divine Scriptures did not contradict them. And there are writings of certain brethren older than the times of Victor, which they wrote in behalf of the truth against the heathen, and against the heresies which existed in their day. I refer to Justin<SUP><A HREF="#P3445_1612685">395</A></SUP> and Miltiades<SUP><A HREF="#P3446_1612755">396</A></SUP> and Tatian<SUP><A HREF="#P3447_1612816">397</A></SUP> and Clement<SUP><A HREF="#P3448_1613104">398</A></SUP> and many others, in all of whose 5 works Christ is spoken of as God.<SUP><A HREF="#P3449_1613235">399</A></SUP> </P>

<P>5 For who does not know the works of Irenaeus<SUP><A HREF="#P3451_1613630">400</A></SUP> and of Melito<SUP><A HREF="#P3452_1613694">401</A></SUP> and of others which teach that Christ is God and man?<SUP><A HREF="#P3453_1613796">402</A></SUP> And how many psalms and hymns,<SUP><A HREF="#P3454_1614814">403</A></SUP> written by the faithful brethren from the beginning, celebrate Christ the Word of God, speaking of him as Divine.</P>

<P>6 How then since the opinion held by the Church has been preached for so many years, can its preaching have been delayed as they affirm, until the times of Victor? And how is it that they are not ashamed to speak thus falsely of Victor, knowing well that he cut off from communion Theodotus, the cobbler,<SUP><A HREF="#P3456_1616431">404</A></SUP> the leader and father of this God-denying apostasy, and the first to declare that Christ is mere man? For if Victor agreed with their opinions, as their slander affirms, how came he to cast out Theodotus, the inventor of this heresy?"</P>

<P>7 So much in regard to Victor. His bishopric lasted ten years, and Zephyrinus was appointed his successor about the ninth year of the reign of Severus.<SUP><A HREF="#P3458_1617479">405</A></SUP> The author of the above-mentioned book, concerning the founder of this heresy, narrates another event which occurred in the time of Zephyrinus, using these words:</P>

<P>8 "I will remind many of the brethren of a fact which took place in our time, which, had it happened in Sodom, might, I think, have proved a warning to them. There was a certain confessor, Natalius,<SUP><A HREF="#P3460_1617866">406</A></SUP> not long ago, but in our own day.</P>

<P>9 This man was deceived at one time by Asclepiodotus<SUP><A HREF="#P3462_1618207">407</A></SUP> and another Theodotus,<SUP><A HREF="#P3463_1618710">408</A></SUP> a money-changer. Both of them were disciples of Theodotus, the cobbler, who, as I have said, was the first person excommunicated by Victor, bishop at that time, on account of this sentiment, or rather senselessness.<SUP><A HREF="#P3464_1619135">409</A></SUP> </P>

<P>10 Natalius was persuaded by them to allow himself to be chosen bishop of this heresy with a salary, to be paid by them, of one hundred and fifty denarii a month.<SUP><A HREF="#P3466_1619397">410</A></SUP> When 11 he had thus connected himself with them, he was warned oftentimes by the Lord through visions.</P>

<P>12 For the compassionate God and our Lord Jesus Christ was not willing that a witness of his own sufferings, being cast out of the Church, should perish. But as he paid little regard to the visions, because he was ensnared by the first position among them and by that shameful covetousness which destroys a great many, he was scourged by holy angels, and punished severely through the entire night.<SUP><A HREF="#P3468_1620231">411</A></SUP> Thereupon having risen in the morning, he put on sackcloth and covered himself with ashes, and with great haste and tears he fell down before Zephyrinus, the bishop, rolling at the feet not only of the clergy, but also of the laity; and he moved with his tears the compassionate Church of the merciful Christ. And though he used much supplication, and showed the welts of the stripes which he had received, yet scarcely was he taken back into communion."</P>

<P>13 We will add from the same writer some other extracts concerning them, which run as follows:<SUP><A HREF="#P3470_1621064">412</A></SUP> </P>

<P> "They have treated the Divine Scriptures recklessly and without fear. They have set aside the rule of ancient faith; and Christ they have not known. They do not endeavor to learn what the Divine Scriptures declare, but strive laboriously after any form of syllogism which may be devised to sustain their impiety. And if any one brings before them a passage of Divine Scripture, they see whether a conjunctive or disjunctive form of syllogism can be made from it.</P>

<P>14 And as being of the earth and speaking of the earth, and as ignorant of him who cometh from above, they forsake the holy writings of God to devote themselves to geometry.<SUP><A HREF="#P3473_1623241">413</A></SUP> Euclid is laboriously measured<SUP><A HREF="#P3474_1623477">414</A></SUP> by some of them; and Aristotle and Theophrastus are admired; and Galen, perhaps, by some is even worshiped.</P>

<P>15 But that those who use the arts of unbelievers for their heretical opinions and adulterate the simple faith of the Divine Scriptures by the craft of the godless, are far from the faith, what need is there to say? Therefore they have laid their hands boldly upon the Divine Scriptures, alleging that they have corrected them.</P>

<P>16 That I am not speaking falsely of them in this matter, whoever wishes may learn. For if any one will collect their respective copies, and compare them one with another, he will find that they differ greatly.</P>

<P>17 Those of Asclepiades,<SUP><A HREF="#P3478_1624212">415</A></SUP> for example, do not agree with those of Theodotus. And many of these can be obtained, because their disciples have assiduously written the corrections, as they call them, that is the corruptions,<SUP><A HREF="#P3479_1624612">416</A></SUP> of each of them. Again, those of Hermophilus<SUP><A HREF="#P3480_1624699">417</A></SUP> do not agree with these, and those of Apollonides<SUP><A HREF="#P3481_1624798">418</A></SUP> are not consistent with themselves. For you can compare those prepared by them at an earlier date with those which they corrupted later, and you will find them widely different.</P>

<P>18 But how daring this offense is, it is not likely that they themselves are ignorant. For either they do not believe that the Divine Scriptures were spoken by the Holy Spirit, and thus are unbelievers, or else they think themselves wiser than the Holy Spirit, and in that case what else are they than demoniacs? For they cannot deny the commission of the crime, since the copies have been written by their own hands. For they did not receive such Scriptures from their instructors, nor can they produce any copies from which they were transcribed.</P>

<P>19 But some of them have not thought it worth while to corrupt them, but simply deny the law and the prophets,<SUP><A HREF="#P3484_1625872">419</A></SUP> and thus through their lawless and impious teaching under pretense of grace, have sunk to the lowest depths of perdition."</P>

<P>Let this suffice for these things. </P>


<br><br><sup id="P2733_1313474">1</sup>: On Soter, see above, Bk. IV. chap. 19, note 2.
<br><br><sup id="P2734_1313628">2</sup>: Eusebius in his Chronicle gives the date of Eleutherus' accession as the seventeenth year of Marcus Aurelius (177 a.d.), and puts his death into the reign of Pertinax (192), while in chap. 22 of the present book he places his death in the tenth year of Commodus (189). Most of our authorities agree in assigning fifteen years to his episcopate, and this may be accepted as undoubtedly correct, Most of them, moreover, agree with chap. 22 of this book, in assigning his death to the tenth year of Commodus, and this too may be accepted as accurate. But with these two data we are obliged to push his accession back into the year 174 (or 175), which is accepted by Lipsius (see his Chron. der röom. Bischöfe, p. 184 sq.). We must therefore suppose that he became bishop some two years before the outbreak of the persecution referred to just below, in the fourteenth or fifteenth year of Marcus Aurelius. In the Armenian version of the Chron. Eleutherus is called the thirteenth bishop of Rome (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 19, note 5), but this is a mistake, as pointed out in the note referred to. Eleutherus is mentioned in Bk. IV, chap. 11, in connection with Hegesippus, and also in Bk. IV. chap. 22, by Hegesippus himself. He is chiefly interesting because of his connection with Irenaeus and the Gallican martyrs (see chap. 4, below), and his relation to the Montanistic controversy (see chap. 3). Bede, in his Hist. Eccles., chap. 4, connects Eleutherus with the origin of British Christianity, but the tradition is quite groundless. One of the decretals and a spurious epistle are falsely ascribed to him.
<br><br><sup id="P2735_1315326">3</sup>: i.e., the seventeenth year of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, a.d. 177 (upon Eusebius' confusion of Marcus Aurelius with Lucius Verus, see below, p. 390, note). In the Chron. the persecution at Lyons and Vienne is associated with the seventh year of Marcus Aurelius (167), and consequently some (e.g. Blondellus, Stroth, and Jachmann), have maintained that the notice in the present passage is incorrect, and Jachmann has attacked Eusebius very severely for the supposed error. The truth is, however, that the notice in the Chron. (in the Armenian, which represents the original form more closely than Jenner's version does) is not placed opposite the seventh year of Marcus Aurelius (as the notices in the Chron. commonly are), but is placed after it, and grouped with the notice of Polycarp's martyrdom, which occurred, not in 167, but in 155 or 156 (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 15, note 2). It would seem, as remarked by Lightfoot ( Ignatius, I. p. 630), that Eusebius simply connected together the martyrdoms which he supposed occurred about this time, without intending to imply that they all took place in the same year. Similar groupings of kindred events which occurred at various times during the reign of an emperor are quite common in the Chron. (cf. the notices of martyrdoms under Trajan and of apologies and rescripts under Hadrian). Over against the distinct statement of the history, therefore, in the present instance, the notice in the Chron. is of no weight. Moreover, it is clear from the present passage that Eusebius had strong grounds for putting the persecution into the time of Eleutherus, and the letter sent by the confessors to Eleutherus (as recorded below in chap. 4) gives us also good reason for putting the persecution into the time of his episcopate. But Eleutherus cannot have become bishop before 174 (see Lipsius' Chron. der röm. 'Bischöfe, p. 184 sq., and note 2, above). There is no reason, therefore, for doubting the date given here by Eusebius.

<br><br><sup id="P2748_1320974">8</sup>: The fragments of this epistle, preserved by Eusebius in this and the next chapter, are printed with a commentary by Routh, in his Rel. Sacrae. I. p. 285 sq., and an English translation is given in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, VIII. p. 778 sq. There can be no doubt as to the early date and reliability of the epistle. It bears no traces of a later age, and contains little of the marvelous, which entered so largely into the spurious martyrologies of a later day. Its genuineness is in fact questioned by no one so far as I am aware. It is one of the most beautiful works of the kind which we have, and well deserves the place in his History which Eusebius has accorded it. We may assume that we have the greater part of the epistle in so far as it related to the martyrdoms. Ado, in his Mart., asserts that forty-eight suffered martyrdom, and even gives a list of their names. It is possible that he gained his information from the epistle itself, as given in its complete form in Eusebius' Collection of Martyrdoms; but I am inclined to think rather that Eusebius has mentioned if not all, at least the majority of the martyrs referred to in the epistle, and that therefore Ado's list is largely imaginary. Eusebius' statement, that a "multitude" suffered signifies nothing, for muria

<br><br><sup id="P2759_1326955">12</sup>: Of the various witnesses mentioned in this chapter (Vettius Epagathus, Sanctus, Attalus, Blandina, Biblias, Pothinus, Maturus, Alexander, Ponticus) we know only what this epistle tells us. The question has arisen whether Vettius Epagathus really was a martyr. Renan ( Marc Auréle, p. 307) thinks that he was not even arrested, but that the words "taken into the number of martyrs" (§10, below) imply simply that he enjoyed all the merit of martyrdom without actually undergoing any suffering. He bases his opinion upon the fact that Vettius is not mentioned again among the martyrs whose sufferings are recorded, and also upon the use of the words, "He was and is a true disciple" (§10, below). It is quite possible, however, that Vettius, who is said to have been a man of high station, was simply beheaded as a Roman citizen, and therefore there was no reason for giving a description of his death; and still further the words, "taken into the order of witnesses," and also the words used in §10, "being well pleased to lay down his life," while they do not prove that he suffered martyrdom, yet seem very strongly to imply that he did, and the quotation from the Apocalypse in the same paragraph would seem to indicate that he was dead, not alive, at the time the epistle was written. On the whole, it may be regarded as probable, though not certain, that Vettius was one of the martyrs. Valesius refers to Gregory of Tours ( H. E. chaps. 29, 31) as mentioning a certain senator who was "of the lineage of Vettius Epagathus, who suffered for the name of Christ at Lyons." Gregory's authority is not very great, and he may in this case have known no more about the death of Vettius than is told in the fragment which we still possess, so that his statement can hardly be urged as proof that Vettius did suffer martyrdom. But it may be used as indicating that the latter was of a noble family, a fact which is confirmed in §10, below, where he is spoken of as a man of distinction.

The Christians, in so far as they laid so much emphasis as they did upon the material side of the doctrine, and were so solicitous about the burial of their brethren, undoubtedly were in large part responsible for this gross misunderstanding on the part of the heathen.

The enthusiastic spirit of the Lyons Christians comes out strongly in the extract, and considerable light is thrown by it upon the state of the Church there. Imprisoned confessors were never permitted to suffer for want of food and the other comforts of life so long as their brethren were allowed access to them. Compare e.g. Lucian's Peregrinus Proteus.

The majority of the editors of Eusebius substitute his name for that of Miltiades in chap. 16, below, but the mss. all read Miltiadhn , and the emendation is unwarranted (see chap. 16, note 7). Salmon suggests that we should read Miltiades instead of Alcibiades in the present passage, supposing that the latter may have crept in through a copyist's error, under the influence of the name Alcibiades mentioned just above. Such an error is possible, but not probable (see chap. 16, note 7).

<br><br><sup id="P2885_1365957">67</sup>: It is commonly assumed that the Gallic martyrs favored the Montanists and exhorted Eleutherus to be mild in his judgment of them, and to preserve the peace of the Church by permitting them to remain within it and enjoy fellowship with other Christians. But Salmon (in the Dict. of Christian Biog. III. p. 937) has shown, in my opinion conclusively, that the Gallic confessors took the opposite side, and exhorted Eleutherus to confirm the Eastern Church in its condemnation of the Montanists, representing to him that he would threaten the peace of the Church by refusing to recognize the justice of the decision of the bishops of the East and by setting himself in opposition to them. Certainly, with their close connection with Asia Minor, we should expect the Gallic Christians to be early informed of the state of affairs in the East, and it is not difficult to think that they may have formed the same opinion in regard to the new prophecy which the majority of their brethren there had formed. The decisive argument for Salmon's opinion is the fact that Eusebius calls the letter of the Lyons confessors to Eleutherus "pious and most orthodox." Certainly, looking upon Montanism as one of the most execrable of heresies and as the work of Satan himself (cf. his words in chap. 16, below), it is very difficult to suppose that he can have spoken of a letter written expressly in favor of the Montanists in any such terms of respect. Salmon says: "It is monstrous to imagine that Eusebius, thinking thus of Montanism, could praise as pious or orthodox the opinion of men who, ignorant of Satan's devices, should take the devil's work for God's. The way in which we ourselves read the history is that the Montanists had appealed to Rome; that the Church party solicited the good offices of their countrymen settled in Gaul, who wrote to Eleutherus representing the disturbance to the peace of the churches (a phrase probably preserved by Eusebius from the letter itself) which would ensue if the Roman Church should approve what the Church on the spot had condemned. ...To avert, then, the possibility of the calamity of a breach between the Eastern and Western churches, the Gallic churches, it would appear, not only wrote, but sent Irenaeus to Rome at the end of 177 or the beginning of 178. The hypothesis here made relieves us from the necessity of supposing this presbeia to have been unsuccessful, while it fully accounts for the necessity of sending it."

But in the present instance he has written authority, which he mentions below. He seems, therefore, in the indefinite phrase logoj exei , to express doubts which he himself feels as to the trustworthiness of the account which he is about to give. The story was widely known in his time, and the Christians' version of it undoubtedly accepted by the Christians themselves with little misgiving, and yet he is too well informed upon this subject to be ignorant of the fact that the common version rests upon a rather slender foundation. He may have known of the coins and monuments upon which the emperor had commemorated his own view of the matter,-at any rate he was familiar with the fact that all the heathen historians contradicted the claims of the Christians, and hence he could not but consider it a questionable matter. At the same time, the Christian version of the story was supported by strong names and was widely accepted, and he, as a good Christian, of course wished to accept it, if possible, and to report it for the edification of posterity.

<br><br><sup id="P2900_1371936">74</sup>: It is an historical fact that, in 174 a.d., the Roman army in Hungary was relieved from a very dangerous predicament by the sudden occurrence of a thunder-storm, which quenched their thirst and frightened the barbarians, and thus gave the Romans the victory. By heathen writers this event (quite naturally considered miraculous) was held to have taken place in answer to prayer, but by no means in answer to the prayers of the Christians. Dion Cassius (LXXI. 8) ascribes the supposed miracle to the conjurations of the Egyptian magician Arnuphis; Capitolinus ( Vita Marc. Aurelii, chap. 24, and Vita Heliogabali, chap. 9), to the prayer of Marcus Aurelius. The emperor himself expresses his view upon a coin which represents Jupiter as hurling lightning against the barbarians (see Eckhel. Numism. III. 61).

Upon Sunday and during the whole period from Easter to Pentecost all prayers were regularly offered in a standing position, as a symbolical expression of joy (cf. Tertullian, de Corona, chap. 3; de Oratione, chap. 23, &c.). The practice, however, was not universal, and was therefore decreed by the Nicene Council in its twentieth canon (Hefele, Conciliengesch. I. 430). See Kraus' Real-Encyclopädie der Christlichen Alterthümer, Bd. I. p. 551 sqq.

It is recorded also by other writers after Eusebius' time, such as Claudian and Zonaras. None of them, however, attribute the occurrence to the prayers of the Christians, but all claim it for the heathen gods. The only pre-Eusebian Christian accounts of this event still extant are those contained in the forged edict of Marcus Aurelius and in the Apology of Tertullian, quoted just below (cf. also his de Orat. 29). Cyprian also probably refers to the same event in his Tractat. ad Demetriadem, 20. Eusebius, in referring to Apolinarius and Tertullian, very likely mentions all the accounts with which he was acquainted. Gregory Nyssa, Jerome, and other later Christian writers refer to the event.
<br><br><sup id="P2908_1376048">79</sup>: i.e. Claudius Apolinarius, bishop of Hierapolis. Upon him and his writings, see above, Bk. IV. chap. 27, note 1. This reference is in all probability to the Apology of Apolinarius, as this is the only work known to us which would have been likely to contain an account of such an event. The fact that in the reign of the very emperor under whom the occurrence took place, and in an Apology addressed to him, the Christians could be indicated as the source øf the miracle, shows the firmness of this belief among the Christians themselves, and also proves that they must have been so numerous in the army as to justify them in setting up a counter-claim over against the heathen soldiers.Apolinarius is very far from the truth in his statement as to the name of the legion. From Dion Cassius, LV. 23, it would seem that the legion bore this name even in the time of Augustus; but if this be uncertain, at any rate it bore it as early as the time of Nero (as we learn from an inscription of his eleventh year, Corp. Ins. Lat. III. 30). Neander thinks it improbable that Apolinarius, a contemporary who lived in the neighborhood of the legion's winter quarters, could have committed such a mistake. He prefers to think that the error is Eusebius', and resulted from a too rapid perusal of the passage in Apolinarius, where there must have stood some such words as, "Now the emperor could with right call the legion the Thundering Legion." His opinion is at least plausible. Tertullian certainly knew nothing of the naming of the legion at this time, or if he had heard the report, rejected it.

The passage runs as follows: "So far are they [i.e. Simon and Carpocrates] from being able to raise the dead as the Lord raised them and as the apostles did by means of prayer, and as has been frequently done in the brotherhood on account of some necessity-the entire Church in that locality entreating with much fasting and prayer [so that] the spirit of the dead man has returned, and he has been bestowed in answer to the prayer of the saints-that they do not even believe this can possibly be done, [and hold] that the resurrection from the dead is simply an acquaintance with that truth which they proclaim."This resurrection of the dead recorded by Irenaeus is very difficult to explain, as he is a truth-loving man, and we can hardly conceive of his uttering a direct falsehood. Even Augustine, "the iron man of truth," records such miracles, and so the early centuries are full of accounts of them. The Protestant method of drawing a line between the apostolic and post-apostolic ages in this matter of miracles is arbitrary, and based upon dogmatic, not historical grounds. The truth is, that no one can fix the point of time at which miracles ceased; at the same time it is easy to appreciate the difference between the apostolic age and the third, fourth, and following centuries in this regard. That they did cease at an early date in the history of the Church is clear enough. Upon post-apostolic miracles, see Schaff, Ch. Hist. II. p. 116 ff., J. H. Newman's Two Essays on Biblical and Eccles. Miracles, and J. B. Mozley's Bampton lectures On Miracles.

Irenaeus, in this chapter traces the four Gospels back to the apostles themselves, but he is unable to say that Matthew translated his Gospel into Greek, which is of course bad for his theory, as the Matthew Gospel which the Church of his time had was in Greek, not in Hebrew. He puts the Hebrew Gospel, however, upon a par with the three Greek ones, and thus, although he does not say it directly, endeavors to convey the impression that the apostolicity of the Hebrew Matthew is a guarantee for the Greek Matthew also. Of Papias' statement, "Each one translated the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew as he was able," he could of course make no use even if he was acquainted with it. Whether his account was dependent upon Papias' or not we cannot tell.

This shows that even in Irenaeus' time there was as much controversy about the interpretation of the Apocalypse as there has always been, and that at that day exegetes were as a rule in no better position than we are.

<br><br><sup id="P3045_1408110">161</sup>: Pantaenus is the first teacher of the Alexandrian school that is known to us, and even his life is involved in obscurity. His chief significance for us lies in the fact that he was the teacher of Clement, with whom the Alexandrian school first steps out into the full light of history, and makes itself felt as a power in Christendom. Another prominent pupil of Pantaenus was Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 14). Pantaenus was originally a Stoic philosopher, and must have discussed philosophy in his school in connection with theology, for Origen appeals to him as his example in this respect (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 19). His abilities are testified to by Clement (in his Hypotyposes ; see the next chapter, §4), who speaks of him always in terms of the deepest respect and affection. Of his birth and death we know nothing. Clement, Strom. I. 1, calls him a "Sicilian bee," which may, perhaps, have reference to his birthplace. The statement of Philip of Side, that he was an Athenian, is worthless. We do not know when he began his work in Alexandria, nor when he finished it. But from Bk. VI. chap. 6 we learn that Clement had succeeded Pantaenus, and was in charge of the school in the time of Septimius Severus. This probably means not merely that Pantaenus had left Egypt, but that he was already dead; and if that be the case, the statement of Jerome ( de vir. ill. 36 ), that Pantaenus was in charge of the school during the reigns of Septimius Severus and Caracalla, is erroneous (Jerome himself expressly says, in ibid . chap. 38, that Clement succeeded Pantaenus upon the death of the latter). Jerome's statement, however, that Pantaenus was sent to India by Demetrius, bishop of Alexandria, is not necessarily in conflict with the indefinite account of Eusebius, who gives no dates. What authority Jerome has for his account we do not know. If his statement be correct, the journey must have taken place after 190; and thus after, or in the midst or, his Alexandrian activity. Eusebius apparently accepted the latter opinion, though his statement at the end of this chapter is dark, and evidently implies that he was very uncertain in regard to the matter. His whole account rests simply on hearsay, and therefore too much weight must not be laid upon its accuracy. After Clement comes upon the scene (which was at least some years before the outbreak of the persecution of Severus, 200a.d.-when he left the city) we hear nothing more of Pantaenus. Some have put his journey to India in this later period; but this is contrary to the report of Eusebius, and there is no authority for the opinion. Photius ( Cod. 118) records a tradition that Pantaenus had himself heard some of the apostles; but this is impossible, and is asserted by no one else. According to Jerome, numerous commentaries of Pantaenus were extant in his time. Eusebius, at the close of this chapter, speaks of his expounding the Scriptures "both orally and in writing," but he does not enumerate his works, and apparently had never seen them. No traces of them are now extant, unless some brief reminiscences of his teaching, which we have, are supposed to be drawn from his works, and not merely from his lectures or conversations (see Routh, Rel. Sac. I. p. 375-383).
<br><br><sup id="P3046_1411492">162</sup>: The origin of this school of the faithful, or "catechetical school," in Alexandria is involved in obscurity. Philip of Side names Athenagoras as the founder of the school, but his account is full of inconsistencies and contradictions, and deserves no credence. The school first comes out into the light of history at this time with Pantaenus at its head, and plays a prominent part in Church history. under Clement, Origen, Heraclas, Dionysius, Didymus, &c., until the end of the fourth century, when it sinks out of sight in the midst of the dissensions of the Alexandrian church, and its end like its beginning is involved in obscurity. It probably owed its origin to no particular individual, but arose naturally as an outgrowth from the practice which flourished in the early Church of instructing catechumens in the elements of Christianity before admitting them to baptism. In such a philosophical metropolis as Alexandria, a school, though intended only for catechumens, would very naturally soon assume a learned character, and it had already in the time of Pantaenus at least become a regular theological school for the preparation especially of teachers and preachers. It exercised a great influence upon theological science, and numbered among its pupils many celebrated theologians and bishops. See the article by Redepenning in Herzog, 2d ed. I. 290-292, and Schaff's Ch. Hist. II. 777-781, where the literature of the subject is given.

He is evidently, however, giving no independent tradition, but merely draws his conclusion from the words of Eusebius who simply says "from ancient times." The date of the origin of the school is in fact entirely unknown, though there is nothing improbable in the statement of Jerome that ecclesiastical teachers were always there. It must, however, have been some years before a school could be developed or the need of it be felt.

<br><br><sup id="P3051_1414078">166</sup>: Jerome ( de vir. ill. 36) says that he was sent to India by the bishop Demetrius at the request of the Indians themselves,-a statement more exact than that of Eusebius, whether resting upon tradition merely, or upon more accurate information, or whether it is simply a combination of Jerome's, we do not know. It is at any rate not at all improbable (see above, note 1). A little farther on Eusebius indicates that Pantaenus preached in the same country in which the apostle Bartholomew had done missionary work. But according to Lipsius ( Dict. of Christ. Biog. I. p. 22) Bartholomew's traditional field of labor was the region of the Bosphorus. He follows Gutschmid therefore in claiming that the Indians here are confounded with the Sindians, over whom the Bosphorian kings of the house of Polemo ruled. Jerome ( Ep. ad Magnum; Migne, Ep. 70) evidently regards the India where Pantaenus preached as India proper ( Pantaenus Stoicae sectae philosophus, ob pracipue eruditionis gloriam, a Demetrio Alexandriae episcopo missus est in Indiam, ut Christum apud Brachmanas, et illius gentis philosophos praedicaret ). Whether the original tradition was that Pantaenus went to India, and his connection with Bartholomew (who was wrongly supposed to have preached to the Indians) was a later combination, or whether, on the other hand, the tradition that he preached in Bartholomew's field of labor was the original and the mission to India a later combination, we cannot tell. It is probable that Eusebius meant India proper, as Jerome certainly did, but both of them may have been mistaken.

It has been assumed by some that this Gospel was the Gospel according to the Hebrews (see Bk. III. chap. 25, note 24). This is possible; but even if Pantaenus really did find a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew as Eusebius says (and which, according to Jerome, de vir. ill. 36, he brought back to Alexandria with him), we have no grounds upon which to base a conclusion as to its nature, or its relation to our Greek Matthew.
<br><br><sup id="P3057_1417298">170</sup>: Eusebius apparently puts the journey of Pantaenus in the middle of his Alexandrian activity, and makes him return again and teach there until his death. Jerome also agrees in putting the journey in the middle and not at the beginning or close of his Alexandrian activity. It must be confessed, however, that Eusebius'language is very vague, and of such a nature as perhaps to imply that he really had no idea when the mission took place.
<br><br><sup id="P3058_1417818">171</sup>: See above, note 1.
<br><br><sup id="P3062_1417902">172</sup>: Of the place and time of Titus Flavius Clement's birth we have no certain knowledge, though it is probable that he was an Athenian by training at least, if not by birth, and he must have been born about the middle of the second century. He received a very extensive education, and became a Christian in adult years, after he had, tried various systems of philosophy, much as Justin Martyr had. He had a great thirst for knowledge, and names six different teachers under whom he studied Christianity (see below, §4). Finally he became a pupil of Pantaenus in Alexandria, whom he afterward succeeded as the head of the catechetical school there. It is at this time (about 190 a.d.) that he comes out clearly into the light of history, and to this period (190-202) belongs his greatest literary activity. He was at the head of the school probably until 202, when the persecution of Severus having broken out, he left Alexandria, and we nave no notice that he ever returned. That he did not leave Alexandria dishonorably, through fear, may be gathered from his presence with Alexander during his imprisonment, and from the letters of the latter (see below, Bk. VI. chaps. 11 and 14, and cf. Bk. VI. chap. 6, notes). This is the last notice that we have of him (a.d. 212); and of the place and time of his death we know nothing, though he cannot have lived many years after this. He was never a bishop, but was a presbyter of the Alexandrian church, and was in ancient times commemorated as a saint, but his name was dropped from the roll by Clement VIII. on account of suspected heterodoxy. He lived in an age of transition, and his great importance lies in the fact that he completed the bond between Hellenism and Christianity, and as a follower of the apologists established Christianity as a philosophy, and yet not as they had done in an apologetic sense. He was the teacher of Origen, and the real father of Greek theology. He published no system, as did Origen; his works were rather desultory and fragmentary, but full of wide and varied learning, and exhibit a truly broad and catholic spirit. Upon his works, see Bk. VI. chap. 13. Upon Clement, see especially Westcott's article in Smith and Wace, I. 559-567, and Schaff, II. 781-785, where the literature is given with considerable fullness.

Various conjectures have been made as to who these teachers were, but none are more than mere guesses. Philip of Side tells us that Athenagoras was a teacher of Clement, but, as we have seen, no confidence can be placed in his statement. It has been conjectured also that Melito may be the person referred to as "the Ionian," for Clement mentions his works, and wrote a book on the paschal question in reply to Melito's work on the same subject (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 26, note 23). This too, however, is mere conjecture.

And again, in II. 12, he speaks very harshly of Tatian, and could hardly have referred to him in this place in such terms of respect and affection.
<br><br><sup id="P3076_1423536">183</sup>: Various conjectures have been made as to the identity of this teacher,-for instance, Theophilus of Caesarea (who, however, was never called a Hebrew, according to Valesius), and Theodotus (so Valesius).

<br><br><sup id="P3079_1424476">185</sup>: This entire passage is very important, as showing not only the extensiveness of Clement's own acquaintance with Christians, but also the close intercourse of Christians in general, both East and West. Clement's statement in regard to the directness with which he received apostolic tradition is not definite, and he by no means asserts that his teachers were hearers of the apostles (which in itself would not be impossible, but Clement would certainly have spoken more clearly had it been a fact), nor indeed that they were hearers of disciples of the apostles. But among so many teachers, so widely scattered, he could hardly have failed to meet with some who had at least known those who had known the apostles. In any case he considers his teachers very near the apostles as regards the accuracy of their traditions.
<br><br><sup id="P3083_1425795">186</sup>: The date of Narcissus' accession to the see of Jerusalem is not known to us. The Chron. affords us no assistance; for although it connects him among other bishops with the first (Armen.) or third (Jerome) year of Severus, it does not pretend to give the date of accession, and in one place says expressly that the dates of the Jerusalem bishops are not known ( non potuimus discernere tempora singulorum ). But from chap. 22 we learn that he was already bishop in the tenth year of Commodus (189 a.d.); from chap. 23, that he was one of those that presided at a Palestinian council, called in the time of Bishop Victor, of Rome, to discuss the paschal question (see chap. 23,§2); from Bk. VI. chap. 8, that he was alive at the time of the persecution of Severus (202 sq.); and from the fragment of one of Alexander's epistles given in Bk. VI. chap. 11, that he was still alive in his 116th year, sometime after 212 a.d. (see Bk. VI. chap. 11, note 1). Epiphanius ( Haer. LXVI. 20) reports that he lived until the reign of Alexander Severus (222 a.d.), and this in itself would not be impossible; for the epistle of Alexander referred tomight have been written as late as 222. But Epiphanius is a writer of no authority; and the fact is, that in connection with Origen's visit in Palestine, in 216 (see Bk. VI. chap. 19), Alexander is mentioned as bishop of Jerusalem; and Narcissus is not referred to. We must, therefore, conclude that Narcissus was dead before 216. We learn from Bk. VI. chap. 9 that Narcissus had the reputation of being a great miracle-worker, and he was a man of such great piety and sanctity as to excite the hatred of a number of evil-doers, who conspired against him to blacken his character. In consequence of this he left Jerusalem, and disappeared entirely from the haunts of men, so that it became necessary to appoint another bishop in his place. Afterward, his slanderers having suffered the curses imprecated upon themselves in their oaths against him, Narcissus returned, and was again made bishop, and was given an assistant, Alexander (see Bk. VI. chaps. 10 and 11). A late tradition makes Narcissus a martyr (see Nicephorus, H. E. IV. 19), but there is no authority for the report.

Jerome gives a very brief account of him in his de vir. ill. 37, but it rests solely upon this chapter, with the single addition of the statement that Rhodo wrote a work Against the Phrygians. It is plain enough, however, that he had for his account no independent source, and that he in this statement simply attributed to Rhodo the work quoted by Eusebius as an anonymous work in chap. 16. Jerome permits himself such unwarranted combinations very frequently, and we need not be at all surprised at it. With him a guess is often as good as knowledge, and in this case he doubtless considered his guess a very shrewd one. There is no warrant for supposing that he himself saw the work mentioned by Eusebius, and thus learned its authorship. What Eusebius did not learn from it he certainly could not, and his whole account betrays the most slavish and complete dependence upon Eusebius as his only source. In chap. 39 Jerome mentions Rhodo again as referring, in a book which he wrote against Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, to Miltiades, who also wrote against the same heretics. This report is plainly enough taken directly from Eusebius, chap. 17, where Eusebius quotes from the same anonymous work. Jerome's utterly baseless combination is very interesting, and significant of his general method.

<br><br><sup id="P3099_1434693">196</sup>: The Fathers entirely misunderstood Marcion, and mistook the significance of his movement. They regarded it, like Gnosticism in general, solely as a speculative system, and entirely overlooked its practical aim. The speculative and theological was not the chief thing with Marcion, but it is the only thing which receives any attention from his opponents. His positions, all of which were held only with a practical interest, were not treated by him in a speculative manner, nor were they handled logically and systematically. As a consequence, many contradictions occur in them. These contradictions were felt by his followers, who laid more and more emphasis upon the speculative over against the practical; and hence, as Rhodo reports, they fell into disagreement, and, in their effort to remove the inconsistencies, formed various schools, differing among themselves according to the element upon which the greatest weight was laid. There is thus some justification for the conduct of the Fathers, who naturally carried back and attributed to Marcion the principles of his followers. But it is our duty to distinguish the man from his followers, and to recognize his greatness in spite of their littleness. Not all of them, however, fell completely away from his practical religious spirit. Apelles, as we shall see below, was in many respects a worthy follower of his master.
<br><br><sup id="P3100_1436093">197</sup>: Apelles was the greatest and most famous of Marcion's disciples. Tertullian wrote a special work against him, which is unfortunately lost, but from his own quotations, and from those of Pseudo-Tertullian and Hippolytus, it can be in part restored (cf. Harnack's De Apellis Gnosis Monarchia, p. 11 sqq.). As he was an old man (see §5, below) when Rhodo conversed with him, he must have been born early in the second century. We know nothing definite either as to his birth or death. The picture which we have of him in this chapter is a very pleasing one. He was a man evidently of deep religious spirit and moral life, who laid weight upon "trust in the crucified Christ" (see §5, below), and upon holiness in life in distinction from doctrinal beliefs; a man who was thus thoroughly Marcionitic in his principles, although he differed so widely with Marcion in some of his doctrinal positions that he was said to have founded a new sect (so Origen, Hom. in Gen. II. 2). The slightest difference, however, between his teaching and Marcion's would have been sufficient to make him the founder of a separate Gnostic sect in the eyes of the Fathers, and therefore this statement must be taken with allowance (see note 4, above). The account which Hippolytus ( Phil. X. 16) gives of the doctrinal positions of Apelles is somewhat different from that of Rhodo, but ambiguous and less exact. The scandal in regard to him, reported by Tertullian in his De Praescriptione, 30, is quite in accord with Tertullian's usual conduct towards heretics, and may be set aside as not having the slightest foundation in fact, and as absolutely contradicting what we know of Apelles from this report of his contemporary, Rhodo. His moral character was certainly above reproach, and the same may be said of his master, Marcion. Upon Apelles, see especially Harnack's De Apellis Gnosis Monarchia, Lips. 1874.
<br><br><sup id="P3101_1438041">198</sup>: The participle ( semnunomenoj ) carries with it the implication that Apelles' character was affected or assumed. The implication, however, does not lessen the value of Rhodo's testimony to his character. He could not deny its purity, though he insinuated that it was not sincere.
<br><br><sup id="P3102_1438367">199</sup>: This means that Apelles accepted only one God, and made the creator but an angel who was completely under the power of the Supreme God. Marcion, on the contrary, held, as said below, two principles, teaching that the world-creator was himself a God, eternal, uncreated, and independent of the good God of the Christians. It is true that Marcion represented the world-creator as limited in power and knowledge, and taught that the Christian God would finally be supreme, and the world-creator become subject to him; but this, while it involves Marcion in self-contradiction as soon as the matter is looked at theoretically, yet does not relieve him from the charge of actual dualism. His followers were more consistent, and either accepted one principle, subordinating the world-creator completely to the good God, as did Apelles, or else carried out Marcion's dualism to its logical result and asserted the continued independence of the Old Testament God and the world-creator, who was thus very early identified with Satan and made the enemy of the Christian God. (Marcion's world-creator was not the bad God, but the righteous in distinction from the good God.) Still others held three principles: the good God of the Christians, the righteous God or world-creator, and the bad God, Satan. The varying doctrines of these schools explain the discrepant and often contradictory reports of the Fathers in regard to the doctrines of Marcion. Apelles' doctrine was a decided advance upon that of Marcion, as he rejected the dualism of the latter, which was the destructive element in his system, and thus approached the Church, whose foundation must be one God who rules the world for good. His position is very significant, as remarked by Harnack, because it shows that one could hold Marcion's fundamental principle without becoming a dualist.
<br><br><sup id="P3103_1440246">200</sup>: i.e. the Old Testament prophecies. Apelles in his Syllogisms (see below, note 28) exhibited the supposed contradictions of the Old Testament in syllogistic form, tracing them to two adverse angels, of whom the one spoke falsely, contradicting the truth spoken by the other. Marcion, on the other hand (in his Antitheses ), referred all things to the same God, the world-creator, and from the contradictions of the book endeavored to show his vacillating and inconsistent character. He, however, accepted the Old Testament as in the main a trustworthy book, but referred the prophecies to the Jewish Messiah in distinction from the Christ of the New Testament. But Apelles, looking upon two adverse angels as the authors of the book, regarded it as in great part false. Marcion and Apelles were one, however, in looking upon it as an anti-Christian book.
<br><br><sup id="P3104_1441206">201</sup>: This virgin, Philumene, is connected with Apelles in all the reports which we have of him (e.g. in Hippolytus, Tertullian, Jerome, &c.), and is reported to have been looked upon by Apelles as a prophetess who received revelations from an angel, and who worked miracles. Tertullian, De Praescriptione, 6, evidently accepts these miracles as facts, but attributes them to the agency of a demon. They all unite in considering her influence the cause of Apelles' heretical opinions. Tertullian ( ibid. 30, &c.) calls her a prostitute, but the silence of Rhodo and Hippolytus is sufficient refutation of such a charge, and it may be rejected as a baseless slander, like the report of Apelles' immorality mentioned in note 7. There is nothing strange in the fact that Apelles should follow the prophecies of a virgin, and the Fathers who mention it evidently do not consider it as anything peculiar or reprehensible in itself. It was very common in the early Church to appeal to the relatives of virgins and widows. Cf. e.g. the virgin daughters of Philip who prophesied (Acts xxi. 9; Eusebius, III. 31), also the Eccles. Canons, chap. 21, where it is directed that three widows shall be appointed, of whom two shall give themselves to prayer, waiting for revelations in regard to any question which may arise in the Church, and the third shall devote herself to nursing the sick. Tertullian also appeals for proof of the materiality of the soul to a vision enjoyed by a Christian sister ( de Anima, 9). So Montanus had his prophetesses Priscilla and Maximilla (see the next chapter).

<br><br><sup id="P3116_1445120">209</sup>: Apelles was evidently like Marcion in his desire to keep within the Church as much as possible, and to associate with Church people. He had no esoteric doctrines to conceal from the multitude, and in this he shows the great difference between himself and the Gnostics. Marcion did not leave the Church until he was obliged to, and he founded his own church only under compulsion, upon being driven out of the Catholic community.

<br><br><sup id="P3118_1445879">211</sup>: This is a truly Christian sentiment, and Apelles should be honored for the expression of it. It reveals clearly the religious character of Marcionism in distinction from the speculative and theological character of the Gnostics, and indeed of many of the Fathers. With Marcion and Apelles we are in a world of sensitive moral principle and of deep religious feeling like that in which Paul and Augustine lived, but few others in the early Church. Rhodo, in spite of his orthodoxy, shows himself the real Gnostic over against the sincere believer, though the latter was in the eyes of the Church a "blasphemous heretic." Apelles' noble words do honor to the movement-however heretical it was-which in that barren age of theology could give them birth.
<br><br><sup id="P3121_1448085">212</sup>: Rhodo had probably brought forward against Apelles proof from prophecy which led to the discussion of the Old Testament prophecies in general. Although Apelles had rejected Marcion's dualism, and accepted the "one principle," he still rejected the Old Testament. This is quite peculiar, and yet perfectly comprehensible; for while Marcion was indeed the only one of that age that understood Paul, yet as Harnack well says, even he misunderstood him; and neither himself nor his followers were able to rise to Paul's noble conception of the Old Testament law as a "schoolmaster to bring us to Christ," and thus a part of the good God's general plan of salvation. It took, perhaps, a born Jew, as Paul was, to reach that high conception of the law in those days. To Marcion and his followers the law seemed to stand in irreconcilable conflict with the Gospel,-Jewish law on the one side, Gospel liberty on the other,-they could not reconcile them; they must, therefore, reject the former as from another being, and not from the God of the Gospel. There was in that age no historical interpretation of the Old Testament. It must either be interpreted allegorically, and made a completely Christian book, or else it must be rejected as opposed to Christianity. Marcion and his followers, in their conception of law and Gospel as necessarily opposed, could follow only the latter course. Marcion, in his rejection of the Old Testament, proceeded simply upon dogmatic presumptions. Apelles, although his rejection of it undoubtedly originated in the same presumptions, yet subjected it to a criticism which satisfied him of the correctness of his position, and gave him a fair basis of attack. His procedure was, therefore, more truly historical than that of Marcion, and anticipated modern methods of higher criticism.
<br><br><sup id="P3123_1450344">213</sup>: A true Gnostic sentiment, over against which the pious "agnosticism" of Apelles is not altogether unrefreshing. The Church did not fully conquer Gnosticism,-Gnosticism in some degree conquered the Church, and the anti-Gnostics, like Apelles, were called heretics. It was the vicious error of Gnosticism that it looked upon Christianity as knowledge, that it completely identified the two, and our existing systems of theology, some of them, testify to the fact that there are still Gnostics among us.

We know of but one work of his, viz. the Syllogisms, which was devoted to the criticism of the Old Testament, and in which he worked out the antitheses of Marcion in a syllogistic form. The work is cited only by Origen ( in Gen. II. 2 ) and by Ambrose ( De Parad. V. 28), and they have preserved but a few brief fragments. It must have been an extensive work, as Ambrose quotes from the 38th book. From these fragments we can see that Apelles' criticism of the Old Testament was very keen and sagacious. For the difference between himself and Marcion in the treatment of the Old Testament, see above, note 9. The words of Eusebius, "as it seemed," show that he had not himself seen the book, as might indeed be gathered from his general account of Apelles, for which he depended solely upon secondary sources.

<br><br><sup id="P3145_1454441">224</sup>: Montanism must not be looked upon as a heresy in the ordinary sense of the term. The movement lay in the sphere of life and discipline rather than in that of theology. Its fundamental proposition was the continuance of divine revelation which was begun under the old Dispensation, was carried on in the time of Christ and his apostles, and reached its highest development under the dispensation of the Paraclete, which opened with the activity of Montanus. This Montanus was a Phrygian, who, in the latter part of the second century, began to fall into states of ecstasy and to have visions, and believed himself a divinely inspired prophet, through whom the promised Paraclete spoke, and with whom therefore the dispensation of that Paraclete began. Two noble ladies (Priscilla and Maximilla) attached themselves to Montanus, and had visions and prophesied in the same way. These constituted the three original prophets of the sect, and all that they taught was claimed to be of binding authority on all. They were quite orthodox, accepted fully the doctrinal teachings of the Catholic Church, and did not pretend to alter in any way the revelation given by Christ and his apostles. But they claimed that some things had not been revealed by them, because at that early stage the Church was not able to bear them; but that such additional revelations were now given, because the fullness of time had come which was to precede the second coming of Christ. These revelations had to do not at all with theology, but wholly with matters of life and discipline. They taught a rigid asceticism over against the growing worldliness of the Church, severe discipline over against its laxer methods, and finally the universal priesthood of believers (even female), and their right to perform all the functions of church officers, over against the growing sacerdotalism of the Church. They were thus in a sense reformers, or perhaps reactionaries is a better term, who wished to bring back, or to preserve against corruption, the original principles and methods of the Church. They aimed at a puritanic reaction against worldliness, and of a democratic reaction against growing aristocracy in the Church. They insisted that ministers were made by God alone, by the direct endowment of his Spirit in distinction from human ordination. They looked upon their prophets-supernaturally called and endowed by the Spirit-as supreme in the Church. They claimed that all gross offenders should be excommunicated, and that neither they nor the lax should ever be re-admitted to the Church. They encouraged celibacy, increased the number and severity of fasts, eschewed worldly amusements, &c. This rigid asceticism was enjoined by the revelation of the Spirit through their prophets, and was promoted by their belief in the speedy coming of Christ to set up his kingdom on earth, which was likewise prophesied. They were thus pre-Millenarians or Chiliasts.

The mss., however, are unanimous in reading Miltiadhn ; and it is impossible to see how, if Alkibiadhn had originally stood in the text, Miltiadhn could have been substituted for it. It is not impossible that instead of Alcibiades in chap. 3 we should read, as Salmon suggests, Miltiades. The occurrence of the name Alcibiades in the previous sentence might explain its substitution for Miltiades immediately afterward. It is at least easier to account for that change than for the change of Alcibiades to Miltiades in the present chapter. Were Salmon's suggestion accepted, the difficulty in this case would be obviated, for we should then have a Montanist Miltiades of sufficient prominence to justify the naming of the sect after him in some quarters. The suggestion, however, rests upon mere conjecture, and it is safer to retain the reading of our mss. in both cases. Until we get more light from some quarter we must be content to let the matter rest, leaving the reason for the use of Miltiades' name in this connection unexplained. There is, of course, nothing strange in the existence of a Montanist named Miltiades; it is only the great prominence given him here which puzzles us.

The boundary line between the two districts was a very indefinite one, however, and the two were often confounded by the ancients themselves; but we cannot doubt in the present instance that the very exact statement of the anonymous writer is correct.

<br><br><sup id="P3164_1470978">235</sup>: The exact date of the rise of Montanism cannot be determined. The reports which we have of the movement vary greatly in their chronology. We have no means of fixing the date of the proconsulship of the Gratus referred to here, and thus the most exact and reliable statement which we have does not help us. In his Chron. Eusebius fixes the rise of the movement in the year 172, and it is possible that this statement was based upon a knowledge of the time of Gratus' proconsulship. If so, it possesses considerable weight. The first notice we have of a knowledge of the movement in the West is in connection with the martyrs of Lyons, who in the year 177 (see Introd. to this book, note 3) were solicited to use their influence with the bishop of Rome in favor of the Montanists (see above, chap. 3, note 6). This goes to confirm the approximate accuracy of the date given by Eusebius, for we should expect that the movement cannot have attracted public notice in the East very many years before it was heard of in Gaul, the home of many Christians from Asia Minor. Epiphanius ( Haer. XLVIII.) gives the nineteenth year of Antoninus Pius (156-157) as the date of its beginning, but Epiphanius' figures are very confused and contradictory, and little reliance can be placed upon them in this connection. At the same time Montanus must have begun his prophesying some years before his teaching spread over Asia Minor and began to agitate the churches and alarm the bishops, and therefore it is probable that Montanism had a beginning some years before the date given by Eusebius; in fact, it is not impossible that Montanus may have begun his work before the end of the reign of Antoninus Pius.

They were regarded with the most profound reverence by all Montanists, who in many quarters were called after the name of the latter, Priscillianists. It was a characteristic of the Montanists that they insisted upon the religious equality of men and women; that they accorded just as high honor to the women as to the men, and listened to their prophecies with the same reverence. The human person was but an instrument of the Spirit, according to their view, and hence a woman might be chosen by the Spirit as his instrument just as well as a man, the ignorant just as well as the learned. Tertullian, for instance, cites, in support of his doctrine of the materiality of the soul, a vision seen by one of the female members of his church, whom he believed to be in the habit of receiving revelations from God ( de anima, 9).

The authority for these synods is too late to be of much weight, and the report is just such as we should expect to have arisen upon the basis of the account of Montanism given in this chapter. It is possible, therefore, that synods were held in those two cities, but more than that cannot be said. Upon these synods, see Hefele ( Conciliengesch.

The words are employed, of course, only in the figurative sense to indicate the hostility of the Church toward the Montanists. The Church, of course, had at that time no power to put heretics to death, even if it had wished to do so. The first instance of the punishment of heresy by death occurred in 385, when the Spanish bishop Priscillian and six companions were executed at Trêves.

<br><br><sup id="P3181_1481602">246</sup>: There is a flat contradiction between this passage and §21, below, where it is admitted by this same author that the Montanists have had their martyrs. The sweeping statements here, considered in the light of the admission made in the other passage, furnish us with a criterion of the trustworthiness and honesty of the reports of our anonymous author. It is plain that, in his hostility to Montanism, he has no regard whatever for the truth; that his aim is to paint the heretics as black as possible, even if he is obliged to misrepresent the facts. We might, from the general tone of the fragment which Eusebius has preserved, imagine this to be so: the present passage proves it. We know, indeed, that the Montanists had man martyrs and that their principles were such as to lead them to martyrdom, even when the Catholics avoided it (cf. Tertullian's De fuga in persecutione ).
<br><br><sup id="P3183_1482653">247</sup>: Whether this story is an invention of our author's, or whether it was already in circulation, as he says, we cannot tell. Its utter worthlessness needs no demonstration. Even our anonymous author does not venture to call it certain.

Of Theodotus himself (to be distinguished, of course, from the two Theodoti mentioned in chap. 28) we know only what is told us in this chapter and in chap. 3, above. It is plain that he was a prominent man among the early Montanists.
<br><br><sup id="P3186_1484617">249</sup>: The reference here seems to be to a death like that recorded by a common tradition of Simon Magus, who by the help of demons undertook to fly up to heaven, but when in mid air fell and was killed. Whether the report in regard to Theodotus was in any way connected with the tradition of Simon's death we cannot tell, though our author can hardly have thought of it, or he would certainly have likened Theodotus' fate to that of the arch-heretic Simon, as he likened the fate of Montanus and Maximilla to that of Judas. Whatever the exact form of death referred to, there is of course no more confidence to be placed in this report than in the preceding one.

His city was Apamea Cibotus or Ciboti, which, according to Wiltsch, was a small town on Mount Signia in Pisidia, to be distinguished from the important Phrygian Apamea Cibotus on the Maeander. Whether Wiltsch has good grounds for this distinction I am unable to say. It would certainly seem natural to think in the present case of Apamea on the Maeander, inasmuch as it is spoken of without any qualifying phrase, as if there could be no doubt about its identity.
<br><br><sup id="P3195_1488165">254</sup>: Themiso is mentioned again in chap. 18 as a confessor, and as the author of a catholic epistle. It is plain that he was a prominent man among the Montanists in the time of our anonymous author, that is, after the death of Montanus himself; and it is quite likely that he was, as Salmon suggests, the head of the sect.
<br><br><sup id="P3198_1489115">255</sup>: This gives us a clear indication of the date of the composition of this anonymous work. The thirteen years must fall either before the wars which began in the reign of Septimius Severus, or after their completion. The earliest possible date in the latter case is 232, and this is certainly much too late for the composition of this work, which speaks of Montanism more than once as a recent thing, and which it seems clear from other indications belongs rather to the earlier period of the movement. If we put its composition before those wars, we cannot place it later than 192, the close of the reign of Commodus. This would push the date of Maximilla's death back to 179, which though it seems rather early, is not at all impossible. The period from about 179 to 192 might very well be called a time of peace by the Christians; for no serious wars occurred during that interval, and we know that the Christians were left comparatively undisturbed throughout the reign of Commodus.
<br><br><sup id="P3201_1490590">256</sup>: Our author tacitly admits in this paragraph, what he has denied in §12, above, that the Montanists had martyrs among their number; and having admitted it, he endeavors to explain away its force. In the previous paragraph he had claimed that the lack of martyrs among them proved that they were heretics; here he claims that the existence of such martyrs does not in any way argue for their orthodoxy. The inconsistency is glaringly apparent (cf. the remarks made in note 23, above).
<br><br><sup id="P3205_1491656">257</sup>: This shows the bitterness of the hostility of the Catholics toward the Montanists. That even when suffering together for the one Lord they could not recognize these brethren seems very sad, and it is not to be wondered at that the Montanists felt themselves badly used, and looked upon the Catholics as "slayers of the prophets," &c. More uncompromising enmity than this we can hardly imagine. That the Catholics, however, were sincere in their treatment of the Montanists, we cannot doubt. It is clear that they firmly believed that association with them meant association with the devil, and hence the deeper their devotion to Christ, the deeper must be their abhorrence of these instruments of Satan. Compare, for instance, Polycarp's words to Marcion, quoted in Bk. IV. chap. 14, above. The attitude of these Catholic martyrs is but of a piece with that of nearly all the orthodox Fathers toward heresy. It only shows itself here in its extremest form.
<br><br><sup id="P3206_1492788">258</sup>: Apamea Cibotus in Eastern Phrygia, a large and important commercial center. Of the two martyrs, Gaius and Alexander, we know only what is told us here. They were apparently both of them from Eumenia, a Phrygian town lying a short distance north of Apamea. We have no means of fixing the date of the martyrdoms referred to here, but it seems natural to assign them to the reign of Marcus Aurelius, after Montanism had become somewhat widespread, and when martyrdoms were a common thing both in the East and West. Thraseas, bishop of Eumenia, is referred to as a martyr by Polycrates in chap. 24, but he can hardly have suffered with the ones referred to here, or his name would have been mentioned instead of the more obscure names of Gaius and Alexander.
<br><br><sup id="P3210_1493723">259</sup>: This Miltiades is known to us from three sources: from the present chapter, from the Roman work quoted by Eusebius in chap. 28, and from Tertullian ( adv. Val. chap. 5). Jerome also mentions him in two places ( de vir. ill. 39 and Ep. ad Magnum; Migne's ed. Ep. 70, §3), but it is evident that he derived his knowledge solely from Eusebius. That Miltiades was widely known at the end of the second century is clear from the notices of him by an Asiatic, a Roman, and a Carthaginian writer. The position in which he is mentioned by Tertullian and by the anonymous Roman writer would seem to indicate that he flourished during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. His Apology was addressed to the emperors, as we learn from §5, below, by which might be meant either Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (161-169), or Marcus Aurelius and Commodus (177-180). Jerome states that he flourished during the reign of Commodus ( Floruit autem M. Antonini Commodi temporibus; Vallarsi adds a que after Commodi, thus making him flourish in the times of M. Antoninus and Commodus, but there is no authority for such an addition). It is quite possible that he was still alive in the time of Commodus (though Jerome's statement is of no weight, for it rests upon no independent authority), but he must at any rate have written his Apology before the death of Marcus Aurelius. The only works of Miltiades named by our authorities are the anti-Montanistic work referred to here, and the three mentioned by Eusebius at the close of this chapter (two books Against the Greeks, two books Against the Jews, and an Apology ). Tertullian speaks of him as an anti-Gnostic writer, so that it is clear that he must have written another work not mentioned by Eusebius, and it was perhaps that work that won for him the commendation of the anonymous writer quoted in chap. 28, who ranks him with Justin, Tatian, Irenaeus, Melito, and Clement as one who had asserted the divinity of Christ. Eusebius appears to have seen the three works which he mentions at the close of this chapter, but he does not quote from them, and no fragments of any of Miltiades' writings have been preserved to us; he seems indeed to have passed early out of the memory of the Church.

The practice, which had doubtless fallen almost wholly into disuse, was brought into decided disrepute on account of the excesses of the Montanists, and the position taken by this Alcibiades became very soon the position of the whole Church (see the previous chapter, note 14).

She would seem to have lived early in the second century, possibly in the latter part of the first, and to have been a prophetess of considerable prominence. That the Montanists had good ground for appealing to her, as well as to the other prophets mentioned as their models, cannot be denied. These early prophets were doubtless in their enthusiasm far more like the Montanistic prophets than like those whom the Church of the latter part of the second century alone wished to recognize.

IV. chap. 23, and also in all probability from the apologist, mentioned in Bk. IV. chap. 3. Cf. Harnack, Texte und Unters. I. I. p. 102 and 104; and see Bk. III. chap. 37, note I, above.

To what utterance of "the apostle" o "apostolo", which commonly means Paul) our author is referring, I am not able to discover. I can find nothing in his writings, nor indeed in the New Testament, which would seem to have suggested the idea which he here attributes to the apostle. The argument is a little obscure, but the writer apparently means to prove that the Montanists are not a part of the true Church, because the gift of prophecy is a mark of that Church, and the Montanists no longer possess that gift. This seems a strange accusation to bring against the Montanists,-we might expect them to use such an argument against the Catholics. In fact, we know that the accusation is not true, at least not entirely so; for we know that there were Montanistic prophetesses in Tertullian's church in Carthage later than this time, and also that there was still a prophetess at the time Apollonius wrote (see chap. 18, §6), which was some years later than this (see chap. 18, note 3).

<br><br><sup id="P3235_1505080">275</sup>: Of this Apollonius we know little more than what Eusebius tells us in this chapter. The author of Praedestinatus (in the fifth century) calls him bishop of Ephesus, but his authority is of no weight. Jerome devotes chap. 40 of his de vir. ill. to Apollonius, but it is clear that he derives his knowledge almost exclusively from Eusebius. He adds the notice, however, that Tertullian replied to Apollonius' work in the seventh book of his own work, de Ecstasi (now lost). The character of Apollonius' work may be gathered from the fragments preserved by Eusebius in this chapter. It was of the same nature as the work of the anonymous writer quoted in chap. 16, very bitter in tone and not over-scrupulous in its statements. Apollonius states (see in §12, below) that he wrote the work forty years after the rise of Montanism. If we accepted the Eusebian date for its beginning (172), this would bring us down to 212, but (as remarked above, in chap. 16, note 12) Montanism had probably begun in a quiet way sometime before this, and so Apollonius' forty years are perhaps to be reckoned from a somewhat earlier date. His mention of "the prophetess" as still living (in §6, below) might lead us to think that Maximilia was still alive when he wrote; but when the anonymous wrote she was already dead, and the reasons for assigning the latter to a date as early as 192 are too strong to be set aside. We must therefore suppose Apollonius to be referring to some other prophetess well known in his time. That there were many such prophetesses in the early part of the third century is clear from the works of Tertullian. Jerome ( ibid. ) states that an account of the death of Montanus and his prophetesses by hanging was contained in Apollonius' work, but it has been justly suspected that he is confusing the work of the anonymous, quoted in chap. 16, above, with the work of Apollonius, quoted in this chapter. The fragments of Apollonius' work, preserved by Eusebius, are given, with a commentary, in Routh's Rel. Sac. I. p. 467 sq., and an English translation in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, VIII. p. 775 sq.
<br><br><sup id="P3237_1507559">276</sup>: We are not to gather from this that the Montanists forbade marriage. They were, to be sure, decidedly ascetic in their tendencies, and they did teach the unlawfulness of second marriages,-which had long been looked upon with disfavor in many quarters, but whose lawfulness the Church had never denied,-and magnified the blessedness of the single state; but beyond this they did not go, so far as we are able to judge. Our chief sources for the Montanistic view of marriage are Tertullian's works ad Uxorem, de Pudicit., de Monogamia, de Exhort. ad castitat., and Epiphanius' Haer. XLVIII. 9.
<br><br><sup id="P3238_1508185">277</sup>: One great point of dispute between the Montanists and the Catholics was the subject of fasts (cf. Hippolytus, VIII. 12, X. 21, who makes it almost the only ground of complaint against the Montanists). The Montanist prophetesses ordained two new fasts of a week each in addition to the annual paschal fast of the Church; and the regulations for these two weeks were made very severe. Still further they extended the duration of the regular weekly (Wednesday and Friday) fasts, making them cover the whole instead of only a part of the day. The Catholics very strenuously opposed these ordinances, not because they were opposed to fasting (many of them indulged extensively in the practice), but because they objected to the imposition of such extra fasts as binding upon the Church. They were satisfied with the traditional customs in this matter, and did not care to have heavier burdens imposed upon the Christians in general than their fathers had borne. Our principal sources for a knowledge of the dispute between the Montanists and Catholics on this subject are Tertullian's de Jejuniis; Epiphanius, Haer . XLVIII. 8; Jerome, Ep. ad Marcellam (Migne, Ep. XLI. 3), Comment. in Matt. c. 9, vers. 15; and Theodoret, Haer. Fab. III. 2.
<br><br><sup id="P3239_1509457">278</sup>: Pepuza was an obscure town in the western part of Phrygia; Tymion, otherwise unknown, was probably situated in the same neighborhood. Pepuza was early made, and long continued, the chief center-the Jerusalem-of the sect, and even gave its name to the sect in many quarters. Harnack has rightly emphasized the significance of this statement of Apollonius, and has called attention to the fact that Montanus' original idea must have been the gathering of the chosen people from all the world into one region, that they might form one fold, and freed from all the political and social relations in which they had hitherto lived might await the coming of the Lord, who would speedily descend, and set up his kingdom in this new Jerusalem. Only after this idea had been proved impracticable did Montanism adapt itself to circumstances and proceed to establish itself in the midst of society as it existed in the outside world. That Montanus built upon the Gospel of John, and especially upon chaps. x. and xvii., in this original attempt of his, is perfectly plain (cf. Harnack's Dogmengeschichte, I. p. 319 and 323. With this passage from Apollonius, compare also Epiphanius, Haer. XLVIII. 14 and XLIX. I., and Jerome Ep. ad Marcellam ).
<br><br><sup id="P3240_1510821">279</sup>: This appointment of economic officers and the formation of a compact organization were a part of the one general plan, referred to in the previous note, and must have marked the earliest years of the sect. Later, when it was endeavoring to adapt itself to the catholic Church, and to compromise matters in such a way as still to secure recognition from the Church, this organization must have been looked upon as a matter of less importance, and indeed probably never went far beyond the confines of Phrygia. That it continued long in that region, however, is clear from Jerome's words in his Epistle to Marcella already referred to. Compare also chap 16, note 25.
<br><br><sup id="P3241_1511669">280</sup>: There can be little doubt that the Church teachers and other officers were still supported by voluntary contributions, and hence Apollonius was really scandalized at what he considered making merchandise of spiritual things (cf. the Didache, chaps. XI. and XII.; but even in the Didache we find already a sort of stated salary provided for the prophets; cf. chap. XII.). For him to conclude, however, from the practice instituted by the Montanists in accordance with their other provisions for the formation of a compact organization, that they were avaricious and gluttonous, is quite unjustifiable, just as much so as if our salaried clergy to-day should be accused, as a class, of such sins.

Catholic in the sense in which the word is used of the epistles of James, Peter, John, and Jude; that is, general, addressed to no particular church. The epistle is no longer extant. Its "blasphemy" against the Lord and his apostles lay undoubtedly in its statement of the fundamental doctrine of the Montanists, that the age of revelation had not ceased, but that through the promised Paraclete revelations were still given, which, supplemented or superseded those granted the apostles by Christ.
<br><br><sup id="P3252_1514226">285</sup>: This fragment gives us our only information in regard to this Alexander. That there may be some truth in the story told by Apollonius cannot be denied. It is possible that Alexander was a bad man, and that the Montanists had been deceived in him, as often happens in all religious bodies. Such a thing might much more easily happen after the sect had been for a number of years in a flourishing condition than in its earlier years; and the exactness of the account, and the challenge to disprove it, would seem to lend it some weight. At the same time Apollonius is clearly as unprincipled and dishonest a writer as the anonymous, and hence little reliance can be placed upon any of his reports to the discredit of the Montanists. If the anonymous made so many accusations out of whole cloth, Apollonius may have done the same in the present instance; and the fact that many still "worshiped" him would seem to show that Apollonius' accusations, if they possessed any foundation, were at any rate not proven.

That there might have been an individual here and there whose conduct justified this attack cannot be denied, but to bring such accusations against the Montanists in general was both unwarranted and absurd, and Apollonius cannot but have been aware of the fact.

<br><br><sup id="P3285_1521474">307</sup>: Both versions of the Chron. agree in putting the accession of Serapion into the eleventh year of Commodus (190 a.d.), and that of his successor Asclepiades into the first year of Caracalla, which would give Serapion an episcopate of twenty-one years (Syncellus says twenty-five years, although giving the same dates of accession for both bishops that the other versions give). Serapion was a well-known person, and it is not too much to think that the dates given by the Chron. in connection with him may be more reliable than most of its dates. The truth is, that from the present chapter we learn that he was already bishop before the end of Commodus' reign, i.e. before the end of 192 a.d. Were the statement of Eutychius,-that Demetrius of Alexandria wrote at the same time to Maximus of Antioch and Victor of Rome,-to be relied upon, we could fix his accession between 189 and 192 (see Harnack's Zeit des Ignatius, p. 45). But the truth is little weight can be attached to his report. While we cannot therefore reach certainty in the matter, there is no reason for doubting the approximate accuracy of the date given by the Chron. As to the time of his death, we can fix the date of Asclepiades' accession approximately in the year 211 (see Bk. VI. chap.

But from the mention of Serapion's epistles to Domninus (Bk. VI. chap. 12) we may gather that he lived until after the great persecution of Severus (a.d. 202 sq.). From Bk. VI. chap. 12, we learn that Serapion was quite a writer; and he is commemorated also by Jerome ( de vir. ill. c. 41) and by Socrates ( H. E. III. 7). In addition to the epistle quoted here, he addressed to Domninus, according to Bk. VI. chap. 12, a treatise (Jerome, ad Domninum ...volumen camposuit ), or epistle (the Greek of Eusebius reads simply ta

He thinks it is by no means probable that a bishop of Thrace (the nationality of the other bishops we do not know) should have signed this epistle of Serapion's, and he therefore concludes that Serapion simply copies from another epistle sent originally from Thrace. This is possible; but at the end of the chapter Eusebius says that other bishops put in their signatures or notes with their own hands ( autografoi shmeiwseij ), which precludes the idea that Serapion simply copies their testimony from another source, and if they signed thus it is possible that the Thracian bishop did likewise. It may be that Serapion took pains to compose a semi-official communication which should have the endorsement of as many anti-Montanistic bishops as possible, and that, in order to secure their signatures he sent it about from one to the other before forwarding it to Caricus and Pontius.

<br><br><sup id="P3306_1528303">318</sup>: Eusebius, in chap. 15, informs us that both Blastus and Florinus drew manyaway from the church of Rome by their heretical innovations. He does not tell us either there or here the nature of the opinions which Blastus held, but from Pseudo-Tertullian's Adv. omnes Haer. chap. 8, we learn that Blastus was a Quartodeciman. ("In addition to all these, there is likewise Blastus, who would la-tently introduce Judaism. For he says the passover is not to be kept otherwise than according to the law of Moses, on the fourteenth of the month.") From Pacianus' Epistola ad Sympronian. de catholico nomine, chap. 2, we learn that he was a Montanist; and since the Montanists of Asia Minor were, like the other Christians of that region, Quartodecimans, it is not surprising that Blastus should be at the same time a Montanist and a Quartodeciman. Florinus, as will be shown in the next note, taught his heresies while Victor was bishop of Rome (189-198 or 199); and since Eusebius connects Blastus so closely with him, we may conclude that Blastus flourished at about the same time. Irenaeus' epistle to Blas-tus, On Schism, is no longer extant. A Syriac fragment of an epistle of Irenaeus, addressed to "an Alexandrian," on the paschal question (Fragment 27 in Harvey's edition) is possibly a part of this lost epistle. If the one referred to in this fragment be Blastus he was an Alexandrian, and in that case must have adopted the Quarto-deciman position under the influence of the Asiatic Montanists, for the paschal calendar of the Alexandrian church was the same as that of Rome (see the Dict. of Christ. Biog. III. p. 264). If Blastus was a Montanist, as stated by Pacianus, his heresy was quite different from that of Florinus (who was a Gnostic); and the fact that they were leaders of different heresies is confirmed by the words of Eusebius in chap. 15, above: "Each one striving to introduce his own innovations in respect to the truth." Whether Blastus, like Florinus, was a presbyter, and like him was deposed from his office, we do not know, but the words of Eusebius in chap. 15 seem to favor this supposition.

<br><br><sup id="P3330_1541917">329</sup>: Jerome ( de vir. ill. chap. 42, and Epist. ad Magnum, 4) calls Apollonius a Roman senator. It is possible that this is only a natural conclusion drawn by Jerome from Eusebius' statement that he defended himself before the Senate; and this possibility might seem to be strengthened by the fact that Eusebius does not call him a senator here, as we should expect him to do if he knew him to be one. On the other hand, it is highly probable (as shown in the next note) that Jerome had read the fuller account of Apollonius' martyrdom included by Eusebius in his Collection of Martyrdoms, and hence it seems likely that that account contained the statement that Apollonius was a senator. Jerome makes Apollonius the author of an insigne volumen, which he read in the Senate in defense of his faith; but there seems to be no foundation for such a report. It is apparently the result simply of a misunderstanding of the words of Eusebius, who states that Apollonius delivered before the Senate a most eloquent defense of the faith, but does not imply that he wrote an apology. The words that Eusebius uses at the close of this chapter imply rather that the defense made by Apollonius was recorded after its delivery, and that it is this report of it which can be read in his Collection of Martyrdoms.
<br><br><sup id="P3331_1543396">330</sup>: Jerome, followed by Sophronius, reports that the accusation against Apollonius was brought by a slave. Jerome gives the slave's name as Severus ( a servo Severo proditus ); while Sophronius makes Severus the name of the judge ( para tou doulou para Sebhrw prodofeij xristianoj einai ena ge tina uij tauta epithdeiwn ), as supposed by some. Since it is thus almost certain that Jerome had himself examined the fuller account of Apollonius' martyrdom referred to by Eusebius, a favorable light is thrown back upon his report that Apollonius was a senator, and it becomes probable that he obtained this statement from the same source (see the previous note).
<br><br><sup id="P3333_1545969">331</sup>: M. de Mandajors, in his Histoire de l'Acad. des Inscript. tom. 18, p. 226 (according to Gieseler's Ch. Hist., Harper's edition, I. p. 127), "thinks that the slave was put to death as the betrayer of his master, according to an old law renewed by Trajan; but that the occurrence had been misunderstood by the Christians, and had given rise to the tradition, which is found in Tertullian and in the Edictum ad Comm. A siae, that an emperor at this period had decreed the punishment of death for denouncing a Christian." Such a law against the denunciation of masters by slaves was passed under Nerva; but Gieseler remarks that, in accordance with the principles of the laws upon this subject, "either Apollonius only, or his slave only, could have been put to death, but in no case both. Jerome does not say either that Severus was the slave of Apollonius, or that he was executed; and since Eusebius grounds this execution expressly on a supposititious law, it may have belonged only to the Oriental tradition, which may have adduced this instance in support of the alleged law." It is possible that Gieseler is right in this conclusion; but it is also quite possible that Eusebius' statement that the slave was executed is correct. The ground of the execution was, of course, not, as Eusebius thinks, the fact that he brought an accusation against a Christian, but, as remarked by de Mandajors, the fact that, being a slave, he betrayed his master. Had the informant been executed because he brought an accusation against a Christian, the subsequent execution of the latter would be inexplicable. But it is conceivable that the prefect Perennius may have sentenced the informant to death, in accordance with the old law mentioned by de Mandajors, and that then, Apollonius being a senator, he may have requested him to appear before that body, and make his defense to them, in order that he might pass judgment upon him in accordance with the decision of the Senate. It is quite conceivable that, the emperor being inclined to favor the Christians, Perennius may not have cared to pass judgment against Apollonius until he had learned the opinion of the Senate on the matter (cf. what Neander has to say on the subject, in his Ch. Hist. ). As remarked by Valesius, the Senate was not a judicial court, and hence could not itself sentence Apollonius; but it could, of course, communicate to the prefect its opinion, and he could then pass judgment accordingly.

<br><br><sup id="P3340_1549687">334</sup>: The dates assigned to Victor's episcopate by the ancient authorities vary greatly. Eusebius here puts his accession in the tenth year of Commodus (i.e. 189 a.d.), and this is accepted by Lipsius as the correct date. Jerome's version of the Chron. puts his accession in the reign of Pertinax, or the first year of Septimius Severus (i.e. 193), while the Armenian version puts it in the seventh year of Commodus (186). Eusebius, in his History, does not state directly the duration of his episcopate, but in chap. 28 he says that Zephyrinus succeded him about the ninth year of Severus, i.e. according to his erroneous reckoning (see Bk. VI. chap. 21, note 3) about 200, which would give Victor an episcopate of about eleven years. Jerome, in his version of the Chron. and in his de vir. ill., assigns him ten years; the Armenian version of the Chron. twelve years. The berian Catalogue makes his episcopate something over nine years long; the Felician Catalogue something over ten. Lipsius, considering Victor in connection with his successors, concludes that he held office between nine and ten years, and therefore gives as his dates 189-198 or 199 (see p. 172 sq.). According to an anonymous writer quoted in chap. 28, Victor excommunicated Theodotus of Byzantium for teaching that Christ was a mere man. He is best known, however, on account of his action in connection with the great Quartodeciman controversy (see chap. 24). Jerome, in his version of the Chron., says of him cujus mediocria de religione extant volumina, and in his de vir. ill. chap. 34, he tells us that he wrote upon the passover, and also some other works ( super quaestione Paschae, et alia quaedam scribens opuscula ). Harnack believes that he has discovered one of these works (all of which have been supposed lost) in the Pseudo-Cyprianic de Aleatoribus. In his Texte und Unters. Bd. V. Heft 1, he has discussed the subject in a very learned and ingenious manner. The theory has much to commend it, but there are difficulties in its way which have not yet been removed; and I am inclined to think it a product of the first half of the third century, rather than of the last quarter of the second (see the writer's review of Harnack's discussion in the Presbyterian Review, Jan., 1889, p. 143 sqq.).

As remarked there, Eleutherus, according to the testimony of most of our sources, held office fifteen years. The "thirteen years" of this chapter are therefore an error, clearly caused by the possession on the part of Eusebius of a trustworthy tradition that he died in the tenth year of Commodus, which, since he incorrectly put his accession into the seventeenth year of Marcus Aurelius (or Antoninus Verus, as he calls him), made it necessary for him to draw the false conclusion that he held office only thirteen years.

Demetrius is known to us chiefly because of his relations to Origen, which were at first friendly, but finally became hostile. He seems to have been a man of great energy, renowned as an administrator rather than as a literary character. He was greatly interested in the catechetical school at Alexandria, but does not seem to have taught in it, and he left no writings, so far as we know. His relations with Origen will come up frequently in the Sixth Book, where he is mentioned a number of times (see especially chap. 8, note 4).

Jerome, in his de vir. ill. c. 43, speaks very highly of this epistle ( synodicam valde utilem composuit epistolam ); but it seems to have been no longer extant in his time, for in mentioning it and the epistle of Bacchylus of Corinth and others in his Chron., he says that the memory of them still endured ( quarum memoria ad nos usque perdurat ).

According to the next chapter, he was himself the author of an epistle on the subject, which he wrote, according to Jerome ( de vir. ill. c. 44), in the name of all the bishops of Achaia ( ex omnium qui in Achaia erant episcoporum persona ). But the words of Eusebius seem to imply that the epistle was an individual, not a synodical one, for he does not say, "an epistle of those in," &c., as he does in every other case. We must conclude, therefore, that Jerome, who had not seen the epistle, was mistaken in making it a synodical letter. Jerome characterizes it as an elegant composition ( elegantem librum ); but, like the epistle of Theophilus, mentioned in the preceding note, it seems not to have been extant in Jerome's time. The dates of Bacchylus' accession to office and of his death are not known to us.
<br><br><sup id="P3348_1556066">342</sup>: Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, is one of the most noted men connected with the paschal controversy, for the reason that he was the leader of the bishops of the province of Asia, in which province alone the Quartodeciman practice was uniformly observed. He was thus the leading opponent of Bishop Victor of Rome. His relation to the paschal controversy is brought out more fully in chap. 24. The dates of Polycrates' accession to office and of his death are not known to us; though, of course, with Theophilus, Narcissus, Bacchylus, and the other bishops concerned in the paschal controversy, he flourished during the reign of Septimius Severus, while Victor was bishop of Rome. The only writing of Polycrates of which we know is his epistle to Victor, a portion of which is quoted by Eusebius, in Bk. III. chap. 31, and a still larger portion in chap. 24 of this book.
<br><br><sup id="P3352_1558483">343</sup>: The great question of dispute between the church of Asia Minor and the rest of Christendom was whether the paschal communion should be celebrated on the fourteenth of Nisan, or on the Sunday of the resurrection festival, without regard to Jewish chronology. The Christians of Asia Minor, appealing to the example of the apostles, John and Philip, and to the uniform practice of the Church, celebrated the Christian passover always on the fourteenth of Nisan, whatever day of the week that might be, by a solemn fast, and closed the day with the communion in commemoration of the last paschal supper of Christ. The Roman church, on the other hand, followed by all the rest of Christendom, celebrated the death of Christ always on Friday, and his resurrection on the Sunday following the first full moon after the vernal equinox, and continued their paschal fast until the latter day. It thus happened that the fast of the Asiatic Christians, terminating, as it did, with the fourteenth of Nisan, often closed some days before the fast of the other churches, and the lack of uniformity occasioned great scandal. As Schaff says: "The gist of the paschal controversy was whether the Jewish paschal day (be it a Friday or not) or the Christian Sunday should control the idea and time of the entire festival." The former practice emphasized Christ's death; the latter his resurrection. The first discussion of the question took place between Polycarp and Anicetus, bishop of Rome, when the former was on a visit to that city, between 150 and 155. Irenaeus gives an account of this which is quoted by Eusebius in chap. 25. Polycarp clung to the Asiatic practice of observing the 14th of Nisan, but could not persuade Anicetus to do the same, nor could Anicetus persuade him not to observe that day. They nevertheless communed together in Rome, and separated in peace. About 170 a.d. the controversy broke out again in Laodicea, the chief disputants being Melito of Sardis and Apolinarius of Hierapolis (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 26, note 1, and chap. 27, note 1). In this controversy Melito advocated the traditional Asiatic custom of observing the fourteenth day, while Apolinarius opposed it. To distinguish two parties of Quartodecimans,-a Judaizing and a more orthodox,-as must be done if Apolinarius is regarded, as he is by many, as a Quartodeciman, is, as Schaff shows entirely unwarranted. We know only of the one party, and Apolinarius did not belong to it. The third stage of the controversy, which took place while Victor was bishop of Rome, in the last decade of the second century, was much more bitter and important. The leaders of the two sides were Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, and Victor, bishop of Rome,-the latter an overbearing man, who believed that he, as Bishop of Rome, had a right to demand of all other churches conformity to the practices of his own church. The controversy came to an open rupture between the churches of Asia and that of Rome, but other churches did not sympathize with the severe measures of Victor, and the breach was gradually healed-just how and when we do not know; but the Roman practice gradually prevailed over the Asiatic, and finally, at the Council of Nicaea (325), was declared binding upon the whole Church, while the old Asiatic practice was condemned. This decision was acquiesced in by the bishops of Asia, as well as by the rest of the world, and only scattered churches continued to cling to the practice of the earlier Asiatics, and they were branded as heretics, and called Quartodecimanians (from quarta decima ), a name which we carry back and apply to all who observed the fourteenth day, even those of the second and third centuries. This brief summary will enable us better to understand the accounts of Eusebius, who is our chief authority on the subject. The paschal controversy has had an important bearing upon the question of the authenticity of the fourth Gospel, the Tübingen critics having drawn from this controversy one of their strongest arguments against its genuineness. This subject cannot be discussed here, but the reader is referred, for a brief statement of the case, to Schaff's Ch. Hist. II. 219. The Johannine controversy has given rise to an extensive literature on these paschal disputes. Among the most important' works are Hilgenfeld's Der Paschastreit der alien Kirche nach seiner Bedeutung fur die Kirchengesch. u. s. w.; and Schürer's Die Paschastreitigkeiten des zweiten Fahrhunderts, in the Zeitschrift für hist. Theologie, 1870, p. 182-284,-the latter perhaps the ablest extended discussion of the subject extant. The reader is also referred to the article Easter, in Smith's Dict. of Christ. Ant.; to Hefele's Conciliengesch. I. p. 86-101; and especially to the chapter on the paschal controversies in Schaff's Ch. Hist. Vol. II. p. 209-220. This chapter of Schaff's is the clearest, and, in the opinion of the writer, by far the most satisfactory, brief statement of the whole subject which we have.
<br><br><sup id="P3354_1563932">344</sup>: Although other synods are mentioned by the Libellus synodicus (of the ninth century), the only ones which we have good reason for accepting are those mentioned by Eusebius in this chapter and the next; viz. one in Palestine (the Libellus synodicus gives two: one at Jerusalem, presided over by Narcissus, and another at Caesarea, presided over by Theophilus, but the report is too late to be of authority); one in Pontus, under the presidency of Palmas; one in Gaul, under Irenaeus; one in Osrhoëne in Mesopotamia; and one in Asia Minor, under Polycrates. Hefele ( Conciliengesch. I. p. 101) adds one in Rome under Victor; and although Eusebius does not distinctly mention such a synod, we are undoubtedly to conclude that the epistle written by Victor was a synodical epistle and hence Hefele is, in all probability, correct in assuming that some kind of a synod, whether municipal or provincial, took place there at this time (see note 4). From the words of Eusebius at the close of the chapter, we may gather that still other synods than those mentioned by him were held on this subject. The date of all of these councils is commonly given as 198 a.d., but there is no particular authority for that year. Jerome's version of the Chron. assigns the composition of the various epistles to the fourth year of Septimius Severus (196-197); but it is clear that he is giving only an approximate date. We can say only that the synods took place sometime during Victor's episcopate. All the councils, as we learn from this chapter, except the one under Polycrates in Asia Minor, decided against the Quartodeciman practice. Athanasius, however ( de Syn. c. 5), speaks of Christians of Syria, Cilicia, and Mesopotamia as celebrating the paschal feast on the fourteenth day; and Jerome ( de vir. ill. c. 35) says that many bishops of Asia and of the Orient kept up this observance. It is possible that the practice was from the beginning more widely spread than Eusebius supposed, or, what is more probable, that line words of Athanasius and Jerome refer to individual churches and bishops, whose observance of the fourteenth day was not general enough to invalidate what Eusebius says of the common consent of the whole Church, outside of Asia Minor, against the Quartodeciman practice, and that this individual observance, not being officially recognized by any synod, did not seem to him to require mention.

The grammatical construction naturally leads us to supply with the twn the word used with it in the previous sentence, sugkekrothmenwn ,-"those who were assembled."

He is called by Polycrates a martyr, and by Eusebius, in reference to Apollonius' mention of him, "one of the martyrs of that time." There is no reason to doubt that he was a martyr, in the full sense, as Polycarp was; but upon the more general use of the word martuj as, e.g., in connection with John just above, see Bk.

<br><br><sup id="P3377_1571743">358</sup>: A careful exegesis of the passages in John's Gospel, which are supposed by some to contradict the synoptic account, and to put Christ's death on the fourteenth day of Nisan instead of on the fifteenth, shows that John agrees with the Synoptists in putting the passover meal on the fourteenth and the death of Christ on the fifteenth (see Schaff's Ch. Hist. Vol. I. p. 133 ff., and the authorities referred to by him). The Asiatic churches, in observing the fourteenth of Nisan, were commemorating the last passover feast and the death of the paschal Lamb. Their practice did not imply that they believed that Christ died on the fourteenth (as can be seen from fragments of Apolinarius' work quoted in the Chron. Paschale, and referred to above; see, also, Schaff, Vol. II. p. 214). They were in full agreement with all four Gospels in putting his death on the fifteenth. But the paschal controversy did not hinge on the day of the month on which Christ died,-in regard to which there was no widespread disagreement,-but on the question as to whether a particular day of the week or of the month was to be celebrated.

The passover feast among the Jews took place on the evening of the fourteenth of Nisan, and was eaten with unleavened bread (Ex. xii. 6 et passim). It was on the fourteenth of Nisan, therefore, that the Jews "threw away" the leaven, and until the evening of the twenty-first, when the seven days' feast of unleavened bread closed, they used no leaven.

<br><br><sup id="P3385_1574705">362</sup>: There has been considerable discussion as to whether Victor actually excommunicated the Asiatic churches or only threatened to do so. Socrates ( H. E. V. 22) says directly that he excommunicated them, but many have thought that Eusebius does not say it. For my part, I cannot understand that Eusebius' words mean anything else than that he did actually cut off communion with them. The Greek reads akoinwnhtouj pantaj ardhn touj ekeise anakhrutitn adelfouj . This seems to me decisive.
<br><br><sup id="P3388_1575773">363</sup>: This epistle is no longer extant, but in addition to the fragments given in this chapter by Eusebius, a few other extracts from it are found in other writers; thus, in the Pseudo-Justinian Quaestiones et responsa ad orthodoxos occurs a quotation from Irenaeus' work On Easter ( peri tou pasxa
<br><br><sup id="P3390_1576925">364</sup>: The punctuation of this sentence is a disputed matter. Some editors omit the semicolon after the words "yet others more," translating. "For some think that they should fast one day, others two, yet others more, and some forty; and they count the hours of the day and night together as their day." The sense is thus materially changed, but the Greek seems to necessitate rather the punctuation which I have followed in my translation, and so that punctuation is adopted by Valesius, Zimmermann, Burton, Schwegler, Laemmer, Heinichen, Closs, Crusè, and others. We should expect, moreover, that the forty hours' fast should be mentioned in this connection by Irenaeus, as we learn from Tertullian that it was very common; whereas we have no other trace of the forty days' fast at so early a date (cf. the next note).
<br><br><sup id="P3392_1577858">365</sup>: The fast preceding the celebration of the paschal supper, which has grown gradually into our Lent of forty days preceding Easter, is, we are told here by Irenaeus, much older than his day. It is thus carried back at least close to apostolic times, and there is no reason to think that it was not observed about as soon as the celebration of the paschal supper itself was established. Tertullian also mentions the fast, which continued, according to him ( de Fejunio, chap. 2), during the period "in which the bridegroom was taken away," i.e. in which Jesus was under the power of death.
<br><br><sup id="P3395_1580654">366</sup>: i.e. the fourteenth day.
<br><br><sup id="P3396_1580958">367</sup>: The Greek reads: kai toi mallon enantion hn to threin toij mh y0rousi . The meaning is, that the observance of the fourteenth day by these strangers in Rome itself, among those who did not observe that day, would be noticeable and more distasteful than the mere report that the day was so observed in Asia could be. If Victor's predecessor, therefore, allowed such persons to observe that day even in Rome, how much more should he allow the Asiatics to observe it in their own land.
<br><br><sup id="P3398_1581621">368</sup>: Valesius, followed by others, interprets this sentence as meaning that the presbyters of Rome sent the eucharist to other parishes where the paschal festival was observed on the fourteenth of the month. The council of Laodicea (Can. 14) forbade the sending of the eucharist to other parishes, which shows that the custom must have been widespread before the end of the fourth century, and it is therefore quite possible that the bishops of Rome, even as early as the time of Irenaeus, pursued the same practice. But in regard to the statement made here by Irenaeus, it must be said that, so far as we are able to ascertain, only the churches of Asia Minor observed the fourteenth day at that early date, and it is difficult to imagine that the presbyters of Rome before Victor's time had been in the habit of sending the eucharist all the way from Rome to Asia Minor. Moreover, this is the only passage in which we have notice, before the fourth century, of the existence of the general practice condemned by the council of Laodicea. The Greek reads oi pro sou presbuteroi toij apo twn paroiklwn throusin epeuton euxaristia

<br><br><sup id="P3402_1584971">370</sup>: The meaning of this passage has been disputed. The Greek reads: kai en th ekklhsia parexwrhsen o Anikhtoj thn euxaristian tw Polukarpw kat entrophn dhlonoti . Valesius understands Irenaeus' meaning to be that Anicetus invited Polycarp to administer the eucharist in Rome; and this is the common interpretation of the passage. Heinichen objects, however, that parexwrhsen thn euxaristian cannot refer to the administration of the sacrament, and hence concludes that Irenaeus means simply to say that Anicetus permitted Polycarp to partake of the eucharist in his church, thereby proclaiming publicly their fraternal fellowship, in spite of their differences on the paschal question. The common interpretation, however, seems to the writer better than Heinichen's; for if the latter be adopted, the sentence in question says no more than the one which precedes it,-"they communed with each other" ( ekoinwnhsan eautoij ). And moreover, as Valesius remarks, Anicetus would in that case have shown Polycarp no more honor than any other Christian pilgrim who might happen to be in Rome. Irenaeus seems to intend to say that Anicetus showed Polycarp especial honor, and that in spite of their difference of opinion on the paschal question. But simply to have allowed Polycarp to partake of the eucharist in the church would certainly have been no honor, and, on the other hand, not to invite him to assist in the administration of the sacrament might have seemed a sign of disrespect, and have emphasized their differences. The old interpretation, therefore, must be followed, and so far as the Greek is concerned, there is no difficulty about the construction. In the parexwrhsen resides the idea of "yielding," "giving place to"; and so Anicetus yielded to Polycarp the eucharist, or gave place to him in the matter of the eucharist. This in fact brings out the force of the parexwrhsen better than Heinichen's interpretation.

Unfortunately, Harvey did not name the Syriac fragment which contains the statement referred to, and it is not to be found among those collected in his edition (Venables, in Smith and Wace, states that he could find no such fragment, and I have also searched in vain for it). Evidently some blunder has been committed, and it looks as if Harvey's statement were unverifiable.

<br><br><sup id="P3431_1596840">387</sup>: Nothing more is known of this Arabianus, and Eusebius doesnot even tell us the name of his work. His silence is difficult to explain. We can hardly imagine that the title was intentionally omitted; for had there been a reason for such a course, there must have been as much reason for omitting the writer's name also. It does not seem probable that he had never known the title of the book, for he was not in the habit of mentioning works which he had not seen, except with the formula logoj exei , or something of the kind, to indicate that he makes his statement only on the authority of others. It is possible that he had seen this, with the other works mentioned (perhaps all bound in ·ne volume), at sometime in the past, but that the title of Arabianus' work had escaped him, and hence he simply mentioned the work along with the others, without considering the title a matter of great importance. He speaks of but a single work,- allh tij upoqesij tij upoqesij
<br><br><sup id="P3432_1599494">388</sup>: Eusebius does not imply, in this sentence, that he is not acquainted with these works to which he refers. As the words are commonly translated, we might imagine that he was not familiar with them, for all the translators make him speak of not being able to draw any extracts from them for his own history. Thus Valesius: nec narrationem ullam libris nostris intexere possumus; Stroth: "noch etwas darauserzählen kann"; Closs: "noch etwas daraus anführen können"; Crusè: "we can neither insert the time nor any extracts in our History." The Greek of the whole sentence reads, wn dia to mhdemian exein aformhn oux oion te oute touj xronouj paradounai grafh, ouq= istoriaj hnhmhn uposhmhnasqai , which seems to mean simply that their works contain no information which enables him to give the dates of the authors, or to recount anything about their lives; that is, they contain no personal allusions. This is quite different from saying that he was not acquainted with the works; in fact, had he not been quite familiar with them, he could not have made such a broad statement. He seems to have searched them for personal notices, and to have failed in the search. Whether these words of Eusebius apply to all the works already mentioned, or only to the muriwn allwn just referred to, cannot be certainly determined. The latter seems most natural; but even if the reference be only to those last mentioned, there is every reason to think that the words are just as true of the writings of Heraclitus, Maximus, and the others, for he tells us nothing about their lives, nor the time in which they lived, but introduces them in the most general terms, as "ancient ecclesiastical men." There seems, therefore, no good reason for connecting these writers with the reign of Cornmodus, rather than with any other reign of the late second or of the third century. It must be noticed that Eusebius does not say that "these men lived at this time"; he simply mentions them in this connection because it is a convenient place, and perhaps because there were indications which led him to think they could not have lived early in the second or late in the third century. It is quite possible, as suggested in the previous note, that the works of the writers whose names are mentioned in this chapter were collected in a single volume, and that thus Eusebius was led to class them all together, although the subjects of their works were by no means the same, and their dates may have been widely different.
<br><br><sup id="P3433_1602231">389</sup>: Eusebius mentioned first those works whose authors' names were known to him, but now adds that he is acquainted with many other writings which bear the name of no author. He claims, however, that the works testify to their authors' orthodoxy, and he seems to imply, by this statement, that he has convinced himself of their orthodoxy by a personal examination of them.
<br><br><sup id="P3437_1602821">390</sup>: This anonymous work against the heresy of Artemon is no longer extant, and the only fragments of it which we have are those preserved by Eusebius in this chapter. Theodoret ( Haer. Fab. II. 5) mentions the work, and says that it was directed against the heresies of Theodotus and Artemon, and that it bore the name Little Labyrinth. It is plain, from the fragments which Eusebius gives, that it was written in Rome some little time before the middle of the third century, probably not far from 230 or 240 a.d. The work is commonly ascribed to Hippolytus, in favor of which may be urged both the time and the place of its composition as well as some internal resemblance between it and the Philosophumena. On the other hand, Photius ( Cod. 48 ) ascribes to Caius of Rome a work against Artemon, which may well be identical with the anonymous work quoted in the present chapter. It is therefore contended by some (e.g. by Salmon) that Caius was the author of the work. It must be noted, however, that in the same connection Photius ascribes another work to Caius which we know to have been written by Hippolytus, and hence his testimony is rather in favor of Hippolytus than Caius as the author of the work. On the other hand several objections have been urged by Salmon against the Hippolytine authorship, which, while not decisive, yet make it extremely doubtful. In view of these facts, we must conclude that it is possible, but very improbable, that Hippolytus wrote the work; that it is not impossible, though we are quite without evidence for the supposition, that Caius wrote it; that it is more likely that a work which even to Eusebius was anonymous, was written by an unknown man, who must remain unknown to us also. The extant fragments of the work are given, with notes, by Routh in his Rel. Sac., and an English translation in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. V. p. 601 sq., among the works of Caius. Although the work is said by Eusebius to have been directed against the heresy of Artemon, he has preserved only extracts relating to the Theodoti and their heresy. They are described also by Hippolytus, both in his lost Syntagma (as we can learn from Pseudo-Tertullian, Epiphanius, and Philaster) and in his Philosophumena (VII. 23-24, and X. 19). Other ancient writers that mention him know only what our anonymous author or Hippolytus reports. It seems that the older Theodotus, a native of Byzantium, came to Rome in the time of Eleutherus or Victor, and taught a species of adoptionism, which reminds us somewhat of the Asia Minor Alogi, in whose circle he may have been trained. Hippolytus informs us that he was orthodox in his theology and cosmology, but that he was heretical in his Christology. He did not deny Christ's birth from a virgin (as the Ebionites had done), but he did deny his divinity, teaching that he was a mere man ( yiloj anqrwpoj ), upon whom the Holy Spirit descended at the time of his baptism, in consequence of which he became the Christ, received power to fulfill his special mission and by his righteousness was raised above all other men. The descent of the Holy Spirit, however, although raising him to a very exalted position, did not make him divine; some of Theodotus' followers denying that he ever acquired divinity, others believing that he acquired it by his resurrection. Theodotus was excommunicated by Victor on account of his heretical Christology, but gained a number of followers, and after his excommunication founded a schismatical sect, which had bishop Natalius, to whom a regular salary was paid (see below, §10), and which continued under the leadership of another Theodotus, a banker, and a certain Asclepiodotus, both of them disciples of the first Theodotus, during the episcopate of Zephyrinus, but seems soon to have disappeared, and to have exerted comparatively little influence during its brief existence. Theodotus, the banker, appears to have agreed substantially with the older Theodotus, but to have indulged himself in speculations concerning Melchizedek, pronouncing him to be a heavenly power still higher than Christ. Epiphanius makes the second Theodotus the founder of a second party, and gives his school the name of Melchizedekians, which appears in later works on heresy, but there is no reason to suppose that there were two separate parties.

<br><br><sup id="P3440_1609437">392</sup>: The Artemonites were certainly correct in maintaining that the adoptionism which they held was, at least in its essential principles, an ancient thing, and their opponents were wrong in trying to deny it. It is the Christology which Hermas represents, and early in the second century it was undoubtedly a widespread popular belief. No one thought of questioning the orthodoxy of Hermas. The Christology of the Theodotians and of Artemon was an innovation, however, in so far as it attempted to formulate in scientific terms and to treat philosophically what had hitherto been only a popular belief. So soon as the logical conclusions were drawn, and its consequences to the divinity of the Son were perceived, it began to be felt as heresy, but not until then.
<br><br><sup id="P3442_1610553">393</sup>: On Victor, see above, chap. 22, note 1. Victor is the thirteenth bishop if Cletus and Anencletus be reckoned as one, otherwise the fourteenth. This is used by Salmon as an argument against the Hippolytine authorship of the Little Labyrinth, for Hippolytus reckoned Cletus and Anencletus as two bishops, and therefore made Victor the fourteenth (see above, Bk. III. chap. 13, note 3).
<br><br><sup id="P3443_1610985">394</sup>: The dates of Zephyrinus' episcopate are to be gained by reckoning backward from that of Callistus, which is shown in Bk. VI. chap. 21, note 3, to have begun in the year 217. A comparison of the various sources shows that Zephyrinus was bishop eighteen or nineteen years, which brings us back to the year 198 or 199 as the date of his accession. Eusebius says "about the ninth year of the reign of Severus," which according to the correct reckoning would be the year 201, but according to his erroneous reckoning of the dates of the emperors' reigns (see the note already referred to) gives the year 200, so that the agreement is reasonably close (see Lipsius' Chron. der röm. Bischöfe, p. 172 sq., and see above, Bk. V. chap. 22, note 1). In Bk. IX. of his great work Hippolytus gives quite an account of Zephyrinus and his successor, Callistus. The former is described as ignorant and illiterate, a taker of bribes, an uninformed and shamefully corrupt man, &c. How much of this is true and how much is due to prejudice, we cannot tell. But it seems at least to be a fact that Zephyrthus was completely under the influence of Callistus, as Hippolytus states. We learn from the latter that Zephyrthus at least countenanced the heresy of Patripassianism (at the opposite extreme from that of the Theodotians and Artemon), if he did not directly teach it.

No one before him bad emphasized so energetically and brought out so clearly the God-manhood of Christ. His great significance in Christology is the emphasis which he laid upon the unity of God and man in Christ,-a unity in which the integrity both of the divine and of the human was preserved. Our author is also doubtless correct in saying that Melito called Christ God and man. If the two fragments from the Discourse on the Soul and Body , and from the Discourse on the Cross (printed from the Syriac by Cureton, in his Spic. Syr. p. 52 sq.), be genuine, as is quite probable (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 26, note 1), we have clear indications that Melito taught both the humanity and the deity of Christ ("when He was become incarnate through the womb of the Virgin, and was born man." "Inasmuch as He was man, He needed food; still, inasmuch as He was God, He ceased not to feed the universe").
<br><br><sup id="P3454_1614814">403</sup>: This passage is sometimes interpreted as indicating that hymns written by the Christians themselves were sung in the church of Rome at this time. But this is by no means implied. So far as we are able to gather from our sources, nothing, except the Psalms and New Testament hymns (such as the "Gloria in Excelsis," the "Magnificat," the "Nunc Dimittis," &c.), was as a rule, sung in public worship before the fourth century (the practice which had sprung up in the church of Antioch seems to have been exceptional; see Kraus, p. 673). Before the end of that century, however, the practice of singing other hymns in the service of the Church had become common, both in the East and West. On the other hand, the private use of hymns among the Christians began very early. We need refer here only to Pliny's epistle to Trajan (translated above, in Bk. III. chap. 33, note 1); Clement of Alexandria, Strom. VII. 7; Tertullian, ad Uxor. II. 8; Origen, Contra Cels. VIII. 67; the epistle of Dionysius quoted below, in Bk. VII. chap. 24, &c.

<br><br><sup id="P3466_1619397">410</sup>: This is the earliest instance we have of a salaried clergyman. The practice of paying salaries was followed also by the Montanists, and brought great reproach upon them (see above, chap. 18, note 8). A Roman denarius was equal to about seventeen cents. so that Natalius' monthly salary was a little over twenty-five dollars.
<br><br><sup id="P3468_1620231">411</sup>: It is not necessary to doubt the truth of this report, if we substitute "muscular Christians" for "holy angels." As Stroth dryly remarks: "Eben kein löblich Geschäft für die heiligen Engel; es werden aber ohne zweifel Engel reit guten starken Knochen und Nerven gewesen sein."
<br><br><sup id="P3470_1621064">412</sup>: The information which is given us here in regard to the methods of the Theodotians is very interesting. What is said in regard to their philosophical principles makes it evident that they used the grammatical and critical mode of exegesis as opposed to the prevalent allegorical mode. Nothing could seem more irreverent and irreligious to the Church of that age than such a method of interpretation, the method which we now recognize as the only true one. They were, moreover, textual critics. They may have been rash in their methods, but it is not necessary to suppose them dishonest in their purposes. They seem to have looked upon the Scriptures as inspired as truly as their opponents did, but they believed that radical criticism was needed if the true reading of the originals was to be reached, while their opponents were shocked at anything of the kind. That textual criticism was necessary, even at that earl day, is clear enough from the words of Irenaeus (quoted in chap. 20, above), and from the words of Dionysius (quoted in Bk. IV. chap. 23), as well as from many other sources. Finally, these men seem to have offended their opponents by the use of dialectical methods in their treatment of theology. This is very significant at that early date. It is indeed the earliest instance known to us of that method which seemed entirely irreligious to the author of the Little Labyrinth, but which less than a century later prevailed in the Antiochian school, and for a large part of the Middle Ages ruled the whole Church.

<br><br><sup id="P3484_1625872">419</sup>: These persons can hardly have rejected the Law and the Prophets utterly,-at least, no hint is given us that they maintained a fundamental difference between the God of the Old and the God of the New Testament, as Marcion did,-nor would such wholesale rejection be natural for critics such as they were. It is more likely that they simply, as many of the Gnostics did, emphasized the merely relative authority of the Old Testament, and that they applied historical criticism to it, distinguishing between its various parts in the matter of authority. Such action is just what we should expect from members of a critical school like that of Theodotus, and such criticism in its extremest form would naturally seem to an orthodox Catholic the same as throwing over the whole book. Cf. Harnack, Dogmeschicte, p. 579 and p. 488 sqq.
