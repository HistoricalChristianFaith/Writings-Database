</P>
<p><b>1.</b> IT is desirable then, that we should hear from the common Saviour
of all himself, who, speaking with men after the manner of a good Parent, became
as a child, and gave (his) answers, as the nature of mortals was able to hear,
by means of the vessel which he assumed, as through an Interpreter. For, when he
made his Divine manifestation among men, he gave many other proofs of the power
of his Godhead, by means of deeds which any one who chooses may collect, from
the Books (that have been written) about Him. Nor will that again, be a trifling
conviction as to His truth, which takes its stand on the words which he uttered,
and which it is necessary we should bring forward against those, who do not
readily give credence to his astonishing Divine performances. Even in those
other things which have been preached respecting Him,--which (consist) in the <i>power
</i>of His words,--there is no small proof afforded to those who possess mind.
For, as on many occasions, we know those whom we have never seen with our eyes,
and whose words only we have heard ; and distinguish the speaker by what we
hear, whether he be Greek, --as the case may be,--or Roman, or even Egyptian;
or, whether in age old, or young; or, whether the strain be that of man, or
woman ; or, the enunciation that of the wise and rational, or, on the contrary,
of the foolish or ignorant; so also, although we might not have happened to see
with our eyes those Divine acts which THE WORD OF GOD performed, when He made
His conversation on earth; still, from the teaching of His words, the
enunciation of which was foreign, and surpassing general apprehension;--also,
from the foreknowledge of things to come to pass which he predicted ;--and,
from the things which he promised he would do in after times ;--as well as from
the issue of the things (so) predicted, the <A HREF="#210"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|210</SPAN></A>
fulfilment of which is now before our eyes, (and) brought about by his
power;--there must result no mean proof, as to those (declarations) which bear
testimony to His Godhead. For, the miracles which were performed by Him may he
divided into (two) periods; that, in which the conversations He made on earth
are commemorated, and that which succeeded, and extends to our times. Those
great acts then, which he formerly did when he was with the men who happened to
exist at that time, it was in their power openly to view ; but to us, these were
unseen ; and they are laid down, (as) having been unseen. And thus again also,
the things which have been fulfilled in our times,--in the order in which His
words foretold them, and are even to this present witnessed by us in the very
facts,--could not, to those of the times in which they were foretold, have yet
been known as to their results; and they were, no doubt, considered by them, who
believed not, as impossible. It is nevertheless likely that even then, those
whose character was that of sound judgment,--although not witnessing the
results of the predictions,--did still believe in them, on account of His other
acts. For, Is it likely that they who saw with their eyes the evident powers of
God, the miracles and astonishing acts and deeds which eclipsed all mortal
nature, believed only the things which were then seen, but, (as) confirmed by
these of his foreknowledge, did not (as) readily also believe those which were
afterwards to come to pass ?--So that again, it is right that we should, from
those miracles which we ourselves have seen, also give our credence to the
things which were then witnessed by his Disciples. For, the very things which
were delivered in the hearing only of (our) predecessors, are (now) visible to
our own eyes: and, they are sufficient for those whose judgment is incorrupt, as
proofs setting a seal on the things which have been recorded. And these are the
things which then existed not; nor had they yet been set up; nor had they so
much as ever entered into the minds of men: but they were foretold by Him, from
His divine foreknowledge of the future ; and, in after times, they have been
fulfilled, and are in (these) our times seen by us, even to this very day.--Of
these, our means of knowledge are at hand. <A HREF="#211"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|211</SPAN></A>
</p>
<p><b>2.</b> A certain man, illustrious from (his) service to the rule and power of the
Romans, was in a state of suspense, because his favourite boy<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> had
become paralytic in his limbs, and was laid (up) in his house; who, when he saw
that our Saviour shewed forth such powers upon others,--healing the sick, and
curing every pain and infirmity,--he perceived in his own mind, that this
miracle was not of man. He approached Him accordingly as God;--not looking to
the vessel of the Body which was visible, and by means of which He carried on
His discourses with men, but to that God who was unseen ; to Him, who by means
of a mortal being, made known these His excellent doings;--he fell down and
worshipped Him, praying and striving<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> (with Him), that He would
afford to him for his boy the aid which is from God. And, when our Saviour said
to him, &quot;<i>I</i> <i>will come and heal him</i>,&quot;<i> </i>the Chiliarch<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
answered Him,--for he had been considered worthy of this rule among the
Romans;--and said to him, &quot; <i>Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest
come under my roof; but, speak the word only, and the child shall be healed.
For, I am a man in authority, and there are soldiers under my hands; and I say
to this, Go; and he goeth: and, to another, Come; and he cometh: and, to my
servant I say, Do such a thing: and he doeth it.&quot; </i>Hear therefore what
our Saviour did upon this request, not from me, but from the Writer
himself,--teaching (us) thus--in the very words : &quot;<i>But, when Jesus
heard it, He wondered, and said to those who </i><A HREF="#212"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|212</SPAN></A>
<i>followed Him, Not even in Israel have I found such faith as this. And I
say unto you, that many shall come from the East and from the West, and shall
sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the
children of the kingdom shall go out into outer darkness.&quot; </i>And, after
these words, He thus spoke to the Chiliarch: &quot;Go: <i>as thou hast believed,
shall it be unto thee. And his boy was healed from that hour.&quot; </i>And,
when the Chiliarch returned to his house, in that very hour he found his boy
well.
</p>
<p><b>3.</b> With so much power therefore, did the word of our Saviour go forth, and
shewed so much virtue, and so replete was it with power and with so much mercy,
and with such ease were the good aids (it afforded given), that He readily
promised He would come. And such indeed was the miracle which accompanied the
act, that it is impossible to conceive of it as we ought. For this, that He said
to the Chiliarch no more than, <i>&quot;As thou hast believed, so shall it be
unto thee,&quot; </i>and, with the word, gave health to his son, How effectually
does it shew, that it was God who spoke in mortal voice ! But, should any one be
persuaded of this with difficulty, on account of the greatness of the miracle;
still, such cannot fairly be excused as to His prediction, in which a powerful
argument will be afforded in favour of the deed, if any one will consider that
at this period, the Roman who drew near to our Saviour, was ONE (only), namely,
the Chiliarch, who made a greater and better profession of Him, than (did the
whole) Jewish people; and, that our Saviour prophesied that instead of ONE,
those, who should like this man draw near to Him, should be MANY ; and, that
these should be of those residing in the East, and in the West<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>:--those
(I say), who, by means of the <A HREF="#213"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|213</SPAN></A> knowledge of Him, and of the confession (made) of Him, should be considered
worthy of honour with God, equal to that of the Hebrew Fathers:--even of him
who is preached of as being the Father of their Fathers, Abraham, who went forth
from among his idolatrous forefathers, and changed his manner of life; and,
leaving the error of many Gods, recognized the ONE GOD who is over all. He also
foretold, that like to this (man), and to his sons Isaac and Jacob, there should
be myriads of men throughout the whole creation; and particularly of those who
resided both in the East, and the West. To these things He added,--and this
(constitutes) the greatness of the prediction,--that these very Jews, the
descendants of these Friends of God, who make their boast of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, should, on account of their resistance to Him, and their want of belief
in Him,--as if cut off from the light of knowledge,--go forth into outer
darkness : and, because of their extreme ignorance and foolishness, (be
consigned to) an entire disseverance from the light of salvation. Thus He
predicted.--It is now right we should consider the fulfilment of these things,
and receive from the testimony of our eyes how these very Jews, who boasted of
their descent from the family of those called the Friends of God, have been cast
out, not only from the kingdom of God, but also from their own metropolis, the
most excellent place of rule, in which the law appointed that their noblest
service should be performed ! and (how) those who were formerly free, and the
virtuous children of these Fathers, have become slaves; and, being mixed with
foreign nations,--a thing unlawful with them,--wander about in lands not their
own, and are not permitted to view, even from a distance, the land of their own
religious worship! Being moreover, deprived of those princes and kings, who were
vested with <A HREF="#214"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|214</SPAN></A> rule by traditionary right, they now remain in subjection to those who have
rased their temple to the ground, and have subdued their whole nation ! Nor is
there, as formerly, either prophet or revelation; nor is there help, or act of
God. Of all these things, not one existed from ancient times; it was (only)
after our Saviour had turned away His face from them that these came upon them,
according to His predictions; and such are the things respecting the Jews.
</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Instead then, of that one Chiliarch who drew near to our Saviour at that
period, a number of men exceeding description has, from all nations, drawn near
to Him, not of Chiliarchs only, but also of the mass of the Roman armies; so
that even myriads of princes and governours bearing rule among the nations, and
in the (various) regions; and also of others, much more honourable and exalted
than these,--those who are great, and glory in the royal apartments,--have
like the Chiliarch approached the Christ of God ; and have, by means of his
doctrine, acknowledged the God of those Friends of the Deity, who (formerly)
arose among the Hebrews; and they have accordingly, been considered worthy of a
return from God the supreme King, equal to that afforded to these. If indeed any
one will consider, what numbers of Christians and of churches, and of vast
congregations, are said to be in the country of the Persians and of the Hindoos,
residing in the East; and, how there are with these, through the words of our
Saviour, women, virgins desiring, and men coming over to, holiness, and to the
provisions which are for the life of philosophy and of purity, and how numerous
the confessors are, who live among these:--
</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Also, how those very persons who confess Him who has arisen from the seed
of Abraham, and that He is the Christ of God; and have become, by means of the
new birth which is in Him, the children of Abraham ; and have (thus) set their
seal to the prophetic Word of our Saviour: and this also, that, in like manner,
in the western parts of the world, the whole of Spain and Gaul <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>, in
the countries of the <A HREF="#215"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|215</SPAN></A> Moors and Africans, in the (Islands of the) Ocean itself, and in Britain<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>,
men subscribe to Christ, and even acknowledge the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob: upon Him also they call in their prayers, and are looked upon (as)
partakers with these same (Fathers) in the worship of God:-- If (I say), any
one will therefore take these things into his consideration, he will then
understand what the power of the prophetic word (was) that declared and said, <i>&quot;Many</i><sup><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><i> </i>
</sup><i>shall come from the East and the West, and shall sit down in the bosom of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.&quot; </i>These things
therefore, He said, and foretold to the Chiliarch : and, on many other
occasions, things not unlike these to the Jewish Doctors. And in this manner He
spoke: &quot;<i>When</i><A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><i> ye see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
and all the Prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves going out. And they
shall come from the East, and from the West, and from the South, and shall sit
down in the Kingdom of God.&quot; </i>Of these things an open confirmation is
afforded by the fact, of all nations having been converted to the God who is
over all. These, He therefore said to them, respecting the conversion of all
nations to God, who is over all.
</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Thou wilt learn moreover, from the writings of His Disciples,--that it
was by their means He was about soon to call in the nations--which are to this
effect: &quot; <i>When</i><sup><A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><i> </i> </sup><i>Jesus passed over a part of the sea of
Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Cephas, and Andrew his
brother, casting nets into the sea :--for they were fishers. -- He said to
them, Follow me; and I will make you fishers of men. And they, in the same hour,
left their nets and followed him. And, when he departed thence, He saw two
brethren, James the son of Zebedee and John Ms brother, in the ship with Zebedee
their Father, and He called them ; and they, in the same hour, left the ship and
</i><A HREF="#216"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|216</SPAN></A><i> their Father, and followed Him.&quot;
</i>Another writer too has left it
on record, that He spoke to Simon on two occasions, a prediction similar to
this: <i>&quot;When a great multitude was standing over against Jesus&quot; </i>He
(this writer) has said, that &quot; <i>He went up into one of the ships, which
was Simon's; and, when He had sat down in it, He interpreted to the
multitude.&quot; </i>But, after the teaching which was sufficient,--because it
was suitable that He should add some Divine work to His words, for the advantage
of those who were looking on,--He <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> commanded Simon to &quot;<i>cast
forth his net for a draught: and he said to Him, We have toiled the whole night,
and have found nothing ; nevertheless at thy word, I will cast out the
net.&quot; </i>And, what He had been commanded, he did. And, when he had taken a
great number of fishes, their nets were breaking,--because they were heavy with
the many (fishes),--and they called to those who were in the ship at their
side, to help them. And thus, when they had drawn up the fishes, they filled
both their ships, insomuch that they were pressed to sinking; and, upon these
things, Simon was astonished and wondered, confessing that he was not worthy,
that our Saviour should come near him<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>. But, when He had thus shewn
him a representation of what <A HREF="#217"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|217</SPAN></A> was about to take place, He also gave its explanation (thus); <i>&quot;and
Jesus said to him, Fear not; Thou shalt henceforth be a fisher of men unto
life.&quot; </i>It was to Galileans,--men unacquainted with any thing beyond
the Syriac language, and this mean profession and necessity of fishing, by
which they were driven,--that our Saviour well promised, that He would &quot;<i>make
them fishers of men&quot; </i>and preachers of His doctrine. And, He made them
(such). Nor did He belie His promise; but He shewed forth the &quot;POWER OF
GOD,&quot; the Doer of a thing, which eclipsed every human excellence! For, had
He brought near to Him the Intellectual and the Wise, the Rich, and Illustrious,
among the Jews; and had made use of these (as) the Teachers of His words; it
would indeed have been likely, that men would have supposed this matter to have
been brought about by human means only. For thus are most men usually overcome;
(namely), they are either wrought upon by the gifts of the rich, or, they are
led astray by excellency of speech, or, by the phantasms of science : or, they
fear the power of illustrious personages. But He made use of no such disciples
as these: on the contrary, by the poor, the despised ;--by men ignorant as to
speech, Syrians in language, and in their character humble and mean,--did He
openly manifest His work (of redemption). It was the Divine Power alone, which
He made use of;--that which He evinced when He previously called them, and made
them go forth ; and so promised that He would make them both &quot;<i>Fishers of
men,&quot; </i>and <i>Preachers; </i>that, instead of the nets which they then
had, they should receive from Him the net, which should comprehend in its
texture, an aggregate of the declarations of both the Law and the Prophets, as
well as of those comprehended in (all) the Divine teaching. This they should
cast into the sea of mankind as existing in the world, and inclose (therein) as
many as they could; filling these their rational nets <A HREF="#218"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|218</SPAN></A>
with every sort of the fish that are rational. But these things, which were
then heard by word, were words and sounds, and nothing more: it was an effort of
the Divine Power itself, which, at no distant time, brought them to pass; and so
fulfilled by deeds the things which had been foretold, that, in a short time, He
made His own possession the whole creation of mankind,--congregations
innumerable,--by means of these poor and illiterate men; and, that His Churches
were every where filled, both with Greeks and Barbarians. For, it was not by
that one Divine word of promise, that He would teach His Disciples, but, that He
would MAKE <i>them Fishers of men. </i>Nor was it therefore, that He knew only,
what should come to pass; nor, that He foretold this; but, that He should also
be looked upon (as) the Effectuator of all this knowledge.--He spoke in word,
and He performed and established the deed:-- that something (I say), which was
to be brought about, (He foretold) by demonstration and representation; and of
this He gave the fulfilment in the fact itself! For, to them who formerly toiled
throughout the lengthened night, which was dark and destitute of the true light
and knowledge of God, and could find nothing which they could take, (leading) to
salvation, He arose (as the sun) in His brightness, and commanded those who were
in the light and the day,--not by their art, but by trusting in his word,--to
cast out their nets into the deep. And they so enclosed this great multitude of
fish, that their fishing vessels were pressed to breaking, and the ships
themselves to remaining in the deep from their weight. And, because these things
were so done, astonishment and great fear came upon Simon. But, our Saviour said
(as it were) these things to him, <i>Let not these things alarm thee: they are
(but as) recitations for the present, and representations of something hereafter
to come to pass: for, these are fish unendued with either voice, or reason;
these too, are ships and nets, composed of (earthly) material, and are
inanimate; but, not as these things, are those of which these are the
representations : for shortly afterwards,--that is, immediately, nmv, and
forthwith,--thou shall be a fisher of men unto life (eternal). This laborious
fishing which returns no profit, thou shalt relinquish; and, thou shall become a
</i><A HREF="#219"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|219</SPAN></A><i> fisherman of reasonable creatures, in place of these which are irrational.
Nor shalt thou again draw up those whom thou shalt catch from the depths of the
sea, but from the bitterness of the life that is hateful; from the chambers of
ungodly darkness and from sin, into the light which is intellectual; and to the
elevation of purity. </i>That is, <i>thou shalt catch them for life, by means of
that which is of life: it is not death that thou preparest for them. These first
indeed, which are drawn up out of the sea, and which formerly enjoyed life in
darkness and the deep, perish immediately on their ascending and receiving the
light. But, those who shall be caught by thee from among men, shall be caught up
out of the darkness of ignorance, and shall be changed to the life that is of
God. </i>These things therefore, (namely,) &quot; <i>Thou shalt henceforth catch
men unto life,&quot; </i>our Saviour foretold by the Divine power: and the same,
our Saviour shewed by very deed, were sure and true. This Syrian fisherman
therefore, this net-caster,--did by means of his net,--the texture of which
was by the Divine power composed of the words of mystery,--catch innumerable
multitudes of men. And, &quot; The visual perception of something hidden, is
something visible<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>.&quot; The things therefore, which the long life
of the world,-- and which from the first experienced not the rising (as of the
Sun) of our Saviour,--could not effect:--the things which neither Moses who
gave the law to the Hebrews, nor the Prophets who came after Moses, could ; nor
yet the multitmdes of others, who from ancient times carried as fishermen the
doctrine of God to man, and who toiled throughout the whole night which preceded
his manifestation,--could do, this Galilean, this Pauper, this Barbarian, this
Simon did, by means of his voice bring to pass. The demonstrations indeed, then
given of Simon as to these things, are the Churches which up to this time have
arisen, far more in number than the ships (then present), and these, filled with
fish that are rational. Such is this of Caesarea of Palestine<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>, and
such is that of Antioch of Syria; and such is that of Rome; for, by <A HREF="#220"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|220</SPAN></A>
these Churches--which Simon set up, and by all those near them,--are these
things commemorated. Those too that are in Egypt and in Alexandria itself, did
he again, not by his own means, but by those of Mark, his disciple, erect. Of
those also, that are in Italy and among the nations adjoining, he was the
Steward (Dispenser): and he made his disciple Mark the Teacher and Fisherman of
those in Egypt. Now, give thy consideration likewise, to the rest of our
Saviour's Disciples, on those whom He said <i>He would make Fishers of men;--</i>and
this his word He has shewn forth by deeds. For up to this time He did, and
caused, that, forthwith, and throughout the whole creation of man,-- His
rational net should be filled with every sort of rational fish, Barbarian and
Greek ; and that He should draw up from the depths of evil, and the darkness of
ungodliness, the souls of men ; turning these daily and hourly to the light and
knowledge of God which had been delivered by Himself. Which things, seen as they
are with our own eyes, establish,--as it appears to me,--beyond (all) doubt,
the Divine manifestation of our Saviour.
</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Art thou desirous then, of hearing a third declaration of the Divine word,
which foretold that His Disciples should arise (as the Sun) throughout the whole
world ? Hear this also, for it is after this manner : <i>&quot;Ye</i><A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> <i>
are the light of the world</i>:&quot; and, &quot;<i>A city that is built on a
hill cannot lie hidden:&quot; </i>&quot;<i>nor do men light a candle, and place
it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick; and it giveth light to all that are
in the house. So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.&quot; </i>Here again, these
very fishermen, who went forth from Galilee, --a corner of Judea so called,
which is situate on the sea; and of which Isaiah,--one of the
Prophets,--making known at once its obscurity, and at the same time, the rising
(as of the Sun) of our Saviour, which he announced should take place
there,--proclaimed (saying), <i>&quot;Galilee</i><A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> <i> of the
Gentiles, a people sitting in</i> <A HREF="#221"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|221</SPAN></A> <i>darkness have seen a great light:&quot;--</i>those (I say) who went forth
from thence; men, mean, necessitous, illiterate in speech, and poor in
circumstances;--those very fishermen He said, should be the light of the world;
and this promise He confirmed by deed ; (namely), that this same Simon who was
called Cephas, (and) who went forth from Capernaum which is a village of
Galilee,--should enlighten many souls of men with the light of the knowledge of
God ; and should himself become known throughout the whole creation, even to the
regions of the West: and, that even to this time, his memory should be more
celebrated among the Romans, than that of those of former times, so that he
should be considered worthy of an honourable sepulchre in the very front of
their city ; and, that great multitudes of the Roman Empire should run to it, as
to a great asylum and temple of God. How then, Does not the truth bear testimony
to Him, who said to his Disciples, &quot;<i>Ye are the light of the world</i>?&quot;
So again, the name of John the son of Zebedee also,--who (was engaged) in
fishing with his father and brethren, and mending the net, whom He (Jesus) saw,
and considered worthy both of this call and promise,--arose (as the Sun)
throughout the whole creation ; and whose words have, through the Gospel which
was delivered by him, also enlightened the souls of men !-- which has been
translated into all languages, both of the Greeks and Barbarians, and is daily
preached in the ears of all nations ! And more particularly, the sepulchre of
this (Disciple) which is in Ephesus of Asia, does glorious honour to his death,
and shews to the world the memorial of that light which cannot be hidden. In
like manner also, the writings of the apostle Paul are preached throughout the
whole creation, and they enlighten the souls of men. The martyrdom of his death,
and the sepulchre which (is erected) over him, are, even to this day, greatly
and abundantly honoured in the city of Rome. And, What need is there we should
say, that the mode of life set up by means of the Disciples of our Saviour
throughout the whole creation,--like the exhibition of a banner of
victory,--is as a famous city which has nothing hidden within it ? but which is
in authority in the midst of all other cities, (and) according to the
enouncement of our <A HREF="#222"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|222</SPAN></A> Saviour, &quot;<i>Is like to a city placed upon a hill?&quot; And </i>this is
the very word, which they preached respecting their master. It was not, as (if)
hidden under a bushel, or given up to error and darkness; but, as upon a lofty
candlestick, and lifted up to an exalted eminence, and giving light to all that
were in the house of the whole world ! And this, (viz.) &quot;<i>Let your light
so shine before men&quot; </i>evinced (both) foreknowledge and prophecy; not
precept only, but also intimation of what should come to pass. He fully too
named them all (here), the light when He said, &quot;YE <i>are the light of the
world.&quot; </i>Not, that they were many lights; but, that they all together
(constituted) one light: as if from an equality<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> of them all, there
should be at once an arising (of light as of the Sun) to the whole world. For,
it was His alone to say, &quot;I AM<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> <i>the light of the world.&quot;
</i>And of Him it has been truly said, that &quot;<i>He</i><A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A><i> is the light
that came into the world, which enlighteneth every man.&quot; </i>But, since
these things have been thus foretold, and fulfilled; observe how He again spoke
of, and explained, them to His Disciples: &quot;<i>That</i><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><i> which
I say to you in darkness, speak ye in the light; and, that which ye hear in your
ears, preach ye on the housetops. And fear not those who kill the body, but
cannot kill the soul. But fear ye Him rather, who is able to destroy both soul
and body in hell.&quot; </i>He also promised by these things, in the very
beginnings (of the ministration) of His Disciples,--when they knew nothing of
them, but were as if they had been in the dark,--the knowledge of the light. He
prophesied also, to those (then) hearing His precepts, that they should preach
openly to all men that which was (now) secret, in darkness, and invisible. He
taught them too, not to be perplexed, but to suffer affliction with all <A HREF="#223"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|223</SPAN></A>
their soul; to preach Him in the ears of all; and not to fear those, who
would kill the mortal body: the soul not being subject to loss of life by men,
because it is incorporeal and immortal. For it is God only, who is able to
inflict punishment and death, at once on both body and soul. It may be observed
therefore, that He taught by these things, that the soul is incorporeal; and set
up, in a few words, the ordinances of (true) philosophy,--
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In that He foretold at the outset to His Disciples, that He would make
them Fishers of men</i>; <i>and, that they should eventually, openly,
immediately, (and) through His power, make Disciples of all nations. </i>From
the Gospel of Matthew<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>8.</b> After his resurrection from the dead, all of them,-- being together as
they had been commanded,--went to Galilee, as He had said to them. But, when
they saw Him, some worshipped Him, but others doubted. But He drew near to them,
spoke with them, and said: &quot;<i>All power (both) in heaven and earth, is
given to me of my Father. Go ye and make Disciples of all nations, and baptize
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And teach
them to observe all that I have commanded you. And, behold! I am with you always
even to the end of the world.&quot; </i>Observe now, in these things, the
consideration and caution evinced by the Disciples: (viz.) that they did not all
worship Him when they saw Him. Some of them indeed did this faithfully and
devotedly, but others refrained for the present. It was not easily and suddenly,
that they gave in to this miracle; but, it was after much investigation and with
every caution they were so at last persuaded, that they went out to all mankind.
They became too, the Preachers of His <A HREF="#224"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|224</SPAN></A>
Resurrection; because it had prophetically said in the Scriptures of the
Prophets, in His Person, &quot;<i>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance, and (for thy) possessions, the uttermost parts of the
earth</i><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>Just as the testimony of this prophecy has
now been fulfilled in fact, He said to His Disciples; &quot;<i>All power is
given to me, as in heaven, so in earth.&quot; </i>For, He had possessed the
sovereignty of the things which are in heaven from eternity<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>; but
now, He said was given to Him, by His Father, those upon earth, in conformity
with this (viz.) &quot;<i>Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thy
possession. </i>For, from ancient times,--as Moses attests,--&quot; <i>The
most High, when dividing the nations, appointed the boundary of the people,
according to the number of the angels</i><A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A><i>.&quot;
</i><A HREF="#225"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|225</SPAN></A><i> </i>So that the Angels of God were, from ancient times, Rulers over all that was
on the earth. But, when mankind had been perverted to the error of many Gods,
and the Angels, who were the Rulers, were unable to afford any remedy for this;
the common Saviour of all Himself taught, by means of His Divine manifestation,
and after His victory over Death, that the empire of the nations upon earth,
should no more be given by his Father to the Angels, but to Himself. And on this
account, He commanded his Disciples,--not from ancient times--but now, that
they should make the circuit, and make Disciples, of all nations. And He
necessarily added the mystery of cleansing. For it was necessary to those, who
should be converted from among the heathen, that they should be cleansed by His
power from every pollution and uncleanness; because they had been defiled by the
error of Demons, and had been holden by the worship of Idols, and by uncleanness
of every sort, but had now first been changed from that life of abomination, and
of lawless practices. These very persons then, did He direct to teach,--after
this cleansing, which is by the mystery of His doctrine,--not, that they should
observe the precepts of the Jews, nor yet the Law of Moses, but all those which
He commanded them to observe. And these <A HREF="#226"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|226</SPAN></A>
are those which the whole of the Disciples,--making severally the circuit of
all the nations,--equally delivered to every Church throughout the whole
creation. He necessarily therefore, stirred them up, and made them readily to
confide,--to undertake the circuit of all nations, and to make Disciples of all
races of men, through the promise by which He counselled them, saying: &quot;<i>Behold,
I myself am with you.&quot; </i>To this word of promise, He also superadded the
performance. He was present in the Divine Power with each and every one of them;
to the whole of them was He at once present, and with them He acted and wrought.
He confirmed too, even to victory, (the promise) constituting them Teachers to
all nations, of that fear of God<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> which was delivered by Himself. In
this promise therefore, they trusted; and forthwith, did they fulfil His words
by deeds: nor did they in any thing hesitate; hut they (so) went forth with all
readiness to the disciplining of all nations, that they engaged in the work.
With their eyes they had seen Him who was a little while before dead, then
living: and, Him whom they had denied with cursing<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>,--on account of
what then happened to them,--they had seen openly, present, and in his own
person; and, as His custom was, He had conversed with them, and promised them
the things of which we have already spoken. Nor could they disbelieve His
promises, because of His appearing (to them); which (appearing) they bad
investigated. Now in this precept, there must have been (much) that was
discouraging to them, knowing as they did in themselves the rusticity and
illiterate character which they sustained; on account of which, they might
indeed have sought to be excused, and have well imagined it impossible that
those, whose Language was the Syriac (only), and who knew nothing beyond the art
of catching fish, could he Teachers both of the Greeks and Romans, of the
Egyptians also, the Persians, and the rest of the barbarous nations : and set
about to legislate,--in opposition to all other Legislators and Kings
throughout the whole <A HREF="#227"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|227</SPAN></A> creation,---that which was opposed to the things delivered to them from all
ages, respecting the Gods of their Forefathers. But it was not possible for them
to think such things, who had heard the voice of God saying to them, &quot;<i>Behold,
I myself am with you always.&quot; </i>They had too, openly viewed the Godhead
of Him who spoke with them. It had been seen to be superior to Death :
respecting which however they had entertained fear. On the contrary they (now)
hear, that henceforth they shall, with all their soul, undergo afflictions. They
had now taken up from their Master, the certainty of life after death ; they
went out tllerefore, with confidence to make the circuit of all nations, that
they might confirm by fact, the promises of Him their Lord. But He attached to
the promises made to them, a more excellent word ; and,--what exceeds all
wonder,-- this He shews forth even to this present time; (viz.) &quot; <i>Behold,
I myself am with you always&quot; </i>He added also, <i>&quot;even to the end of
the world&quot; </i>And this applies, not only to them, but also to all those
who came after them, and from them received His doctrine; and, thenceforward,
even to this time, is He present to all those who have become His Disciples.
Hence, His Church, which is kept by Himself, is daily increasing and multiplying
to myriads; and by His Power shall it be congregated, even to the end of the
world !

</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>9.</b> Again, upon another occasion after His resurrection from the dead, He
appeared to the other disciples, and to them,--yet doubting and not believing
in Him,--He put forth and said these words: <i>&quot;</i><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A><i>These
are the words which I said, to you, when I was yet with you; that it is
necessary every thing should be fulfilled which is written respecting me in the
Law of Moses, in the Prophets, and in the Psalms. Then He opened their
understandings that they should understand the Scriptures : and He said, Thus it
was right that Christ should suffer, and that He should rise from the dead on
the third day; and (that) repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
His name among all nations, beginning from </i><A HREF="#228"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|228</SPAN></A><i>
Jerusalem. And ye are the witnesses of these things.&quot; </i>On one occasion
indeed, He said, that &quot;<i>in His name should be preached repentance to all
nations.&quot; </i>(Now), if <i>the Deed </i>did not follow upon <i>the Word; </i>neither
can His resurrection from the dead be credited. But if, even up to this time,
the things which His prediction foretold, remain in fact, so that His lively,
(energetic) and operative word is visible (in effect) throughout the whole
creation to our eyes; then is it unbecoming we should disbelieve Him who spoke
this. For He, whose power is living (energetic,) operative, and visible to the
eyes, powerfully impels us first of all to confess thereupon, that He is living;
and that He brings to effect the living things of God, whose living (actual)
deeds are seen fulfilling His words. These His words then, --being varied and
translated into all languages, both of the Greeks and the Barbarians,--has He
made intelligible to all<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>, so that His doctrine is heard by all
nations, and has stirred up myriads of congregations of those, who were formerly
wickedly led on in the error of many Gods, in the worship of Idols, and in (the
course of life) which was unbecoming, to conversion and repentance. He did not
command them first to preach remission of sins, and then repentance; but first,
repentance, and then remission. For it was to those, who evinced a sincere
repentance of former sins, that our Saviour's grace gave the pardon of their
deeds;--on whose account indeed He suffered Death, and gave His soul a ransom
for the souls of those, who should be saved through Him. Thus therefore, these
His disciples,--men rude of speech and altogether illiterate, poor and needy,
(as) they were in their character,--trusted in the power of Him who appeared to
them after Death, and openly held converse with them. And they began from
Jerusalem according to His commands, and went forth into all nations; the things
too, which they were commanded, they performed, and preached repentance to all
men, and <A HREF="#229"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|229</SPAN></A> remission of the former sins of the soul. And such was the entire superiority
which they evinced, that, even to these our times, the doctrine of these poor
and illiterate men, is in active operation throughout the whole creation of man.
<i>How His acts should be heard, and preached of, throughout the whole world. </i>From
the Gospel of Matthew and of Mark.
</p>
<p><b>10.</b> When our Saviour was in Bethany, a village not far from
Jerusalem;--having been invited by one who was (named) Simon, and sitting down
there ;--a certain woman took an alabaster box of balsam (ointment), which was
very precious, and came and poured it out upon his feet: but His Disciples
forbade her ; complaining of what had happened. But He received the tiling done
as a sign, and intimated that this act should be preached of, and heard,
throughout the whole world. He prophesied accordingly, and said: &quot;<i>I</i> <i>say
unto you, that wheresoever this my Gospel shall</i><i> be preached
in the whole world, what this </i>(<i>woman</i>)<i> hath done, shall also be
spoken of for a memorial of her</i><sup><A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A></sup><i>.&quot; </i>Now these things
He foretold, when, at that time, the writing of the Gospel had yet entered into
the mind of none, nor had it come to the hearing of any. Nor, as it is likely,
had what was then done, been learned by any who resided in the neighbourhood,
but by those only who were present. Nevertheless, He left this whole enouncement
in word, and prophesied that the Gospels, which should be written by His
Disciples, should be preached throughout the whole world. And to the word He at
once also superadded the deed, and said, that with His acts should be written in
the Gospel, and spoken of throughout the whole world, even that which had been
done by this woman, for a memorial of her:--which same thing has (now) been
seen confirmed by Him in very deed! For there is neither people, region, nor
place, in which the memorial of this woman, as recorded in the Gospel, has not
been mentioned; and, together, with the doctrine respecting Him, is it preached
throughout the <A HREF="#230"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|230</SPAN></A> whole world.--Of the things therefore, respecting this<sup><A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
</sup>(Gospel,) and respecting His Church, hear (now) how He made His promises :
--
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>How He mentioned His church by name, when yet it had no existence: and how
He declared, that the gates of Hell should never prevail against it. </i>From
the Gospel of Matthew.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>11.</b> When asking His Disciples on a certain occasion, what men said of Him,
and they answering according to the opinion of the many, He asked them the
second time, &quot;<i>But</i><A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A><i> what say ye?&quot; </i>and, when
Simon had said unto Him, &quot;<i>Thou art the Christ of the living God&quot; </i>He
answered him, and said : &quot;<i>Blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas, since
flesh and blood hath not revealed (this) to thee, but my Father who is in
heaven. And I also say to thee, Thou art Cephas: and upon this rock do I build
my Church, and the gate-bars of Hell shall not prevail against it</i>.&quot;<i> </i>The
(term) &quot;<i>this&quot; </i>He took (as implying) <i>the knowledge, </i>that <i>He
was the Messiah, </i>the Son of the living God ; and <i>Cephas </i>(the rock),
because it should neither <i>be rent </i>nor <i>moved. </i>It is not unlikely,
that He named (in) &quot; THIS&quot; <A HREF="#231"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|231</SPAN></A>
the whole sense comprised here. On this account too, He designated that same
Disciple, who had formerly been called Simon, <i>Cephas </i>(Peter), with
reference to <i>this knowledge; </i>(and) of which He afterwards prophesied, and
said: &quot;<i>On this rock do I build my Church, and the gate-bars of Hell
shall not prevail against it.&quot; </i>He foretold at once something to come to
pass, and promised, that Himself would build it (the Church), and bring the work
to completion, by the things of this <i>knowledge </i>which had now been <A HREF="#232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A>
given concerning Himself; that it should be made firm as on a confirmed
foundation ; and that His Church should be built, solely by means of His own
power which is everlasting, and that the gates of Hell should never overcome it.
He himself afforded a proof (of this) in the fulfilment, better than any (that)
words (can give). For innumerable persecutions, and many forms of death, have
sprung up against His Church, but in nothing could they prevail against it. He
has therefore, openly confirmed the enouncement of His prediction, by deeds; its
truth He has shewn, by the fulfilment. The Church too, which He called the
congregation, about to be set up in His name, evinced no small foreknowledge:
for the congregations of the Jews had been termed <i>Synagogues; </i>and, during
the time of His going about among men, He frequented the Synagogue of the Jews.
Nor was there hitherto, so much as one Synagogue only, set apart to Him. And,
Who is not astonished, that He so foreknew those congregations which should
afterwards be set up, at a great distance of time, in His name, and, that He
should not name them, after the Jewish custom, <i>Synagogues, </i>but <i>Churches
? </i>He added too, that the gate-bars of Hell should not prevail against
them:-- things, which we perceive with our own eyes ! Nor should we wonder at
the prediction only, but also at His promise, namely, &quot;<i>I</i> <i>build my
Church upon the rock, and the gate-bars of Hell shall not prevail against it</i>:&quot;
which is (all) so brought near in fact, that we can see it ! For it was not by
the power of men, nor yet by the superiority of the Teachers (employed), that
His Church was raised ; but, it was He who promised, and in deed fulfilled His
promise ! --He (I say) who up to this time has, by the Divine Power, built up,
and enlarged, His Church throughout the whole creation of man !&nbsp;

<p><b>12.</b> <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A><i> Think not, that I am come to send forth peace upon earth

against his Father; and the Mother shall be divided against her Daughter, and
the Daughter, against her Mother; and the Mother in law, against her Daughter in
law ; and the Daughter in law, against her Mother in law</i>.&quot; And, Who is
not astonished, that the things which should take place in every individual
house, in times far removed (from those of the prediction), and even up to this
time, did not remain hidden to the foreknowledge of our Saviour ? For He
foretold to His disciples, the things which up to this time are taking place,
just as one present to the things themselves, and making the circuit of the
dwellings of all the children of men :--things which hitherto have not existed,
nor did they at the period in which He enounced these words. Nor, were there yet
any such doings; they were then heard only in the ear. But now, that the
prediction has in fact come to its completion, and is visible to the eyes, How
can any one, who would think justly, but confess that they are in truth the
words of God ? And again in these things also,--<i>&quot;For I am come to
divide and to send forth a sword, and divisions among the children of
men,&quot;&quot;--</i>we likewise see with our own eyes, that no word of man,
either of philosopher or prophet, whether Greek or Barbarian, ever shewed forth
power such as this, that he should so hold the whole creation, that there should
be divisions in every house; that he should pass through and distinguish every
race, throughout all their families ; and, that of these some should be
considered as his own, and others as opposed to these ! But it was our Saviour
alone, and this WORD OF GOD, who promised to do this, and He confirmed the
promise, in very deed ! The cause therefore, of the divisions of soul that came
to <A HREF="#234"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|234</SPAN></A> pass in houses He Himself taught, as we have found in a place in the Gospel
existing among the Jews in the Hebrew language<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>, in which it is said:
&quot;<i>I will select to myself these things: very very excellent are those
whom my Father, who is in heaven, has given to me</i>.&quot; And, one may learn
from this, how in every house in which the word of Jesus should prevail, the
excellent would be distinguished from the vile. For, if a man make a comparison
among brothers, or servants, or in families generally, as to the customs, forms,
manner of life, and the purity and meekness of those, who have chosen the
doctrine of our Saviour;--for this is <A HREF="#235"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|235</SPAN></A>
what is meant by <i>those who have been selected by Him :-- </i>and, of
those who have not yet become worthy of Him ; --he will perceive what sort of
power that is, of which He has made use; and, that He did not only foretel what
should come to pass, but that He has, according to the prediction, also brought
the works to pass : and, with other things, these also in which it is written
that He said, &quot;<i>I will select to myself the</i><A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A><i> very
excellent, those whom my Father who is in heaven has given to me.&quot; </i>Nevertheless,
(what He) now (said), &quot; <i>I am not come to send forth peace on
earth,&quot; </i>with other things, He explained to the Disciples themselves and
said; &quot;<i>I</i> <i>leave peace with you, my own peace give I unto you: it
is not as the world giveth peace, that I also so give peace.&quot; </i>It was
the knowledge and love of God, which He had prepared for His disciples ; and
this, that the soul should not be perturbed. And in this way, He named the
light, and confirmation of the mind. These things therefore He foretold, and
also respecting these (men) : but, of those which He foreknew and foretold
respecting the Jewish People, (the time) is at hand that we should enquire.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>On the things which He prophesied against the Jewish people in parables. </i>From
the Gospel of Matthew.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>13.</b> When the Rulers of the Jewish people, the chief Priests, and the Doctors
of the Law, were assembled together in Jerusalem, and He was in the Temple; He
foretold covertly and by parable, the things they were about to dare against
Him, and the destruction which should overtake them on account of this daring,
in this manner : &quot; <i>There was </i><A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A><i>a certain master of a
house, </i>(who) <i>planted a vineyard, and surrounded it with a fence, and
digged a wine-press therein, and built in it a tower, and delivered it to
husbandmen, and departed. And, when the fruit-season drew </i><A HREF="#236"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|236</SPAN></A> <i>
near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might bring to him
the fruit. But these husbandmen seized his servants, and some of them they
smote, and some they stoned, and some they killed. And again, he sent other
servants, more than the former; and to these, they did in like manner. But at
last, he sent his Son, and said, Surely they will reverence my Son. But these
husbandmen, when they saw the Son, said among themselves : This is his heir ;
come let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours. So they took him, and
cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. When therefore, the Lord of the
vineyard shall come, What shall he do to those husbandmen? They say to him, he
shall most miserably destroy them; and his vineyard he shall deliver to other
husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons. Jesus himself said
to them, Have ye never read in the Scripture, </i>'<i>The stone which the
builders rejected, has become the chief corner stone of the building: This is of
the Lord, and it is a miracle in our eyes?' Wherefore I say unto you, The
kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a people which
shall render the fruits&quot; </i>(thereof.) And this parable is of a sort with
that, which is in the Prophet Isaiah, which is (given) in this manner: &quot;<i>My
beloved had a vineyard on the horn of a fat place. And he cultivated it, and
surrounded it with a fence, and planted in it vines, and built a Tower within
it. He also made a wine-press in it. And he expected that it would produce
grapes; but it produced wild grapes</i>.&quot; But this that is in the Prophet,
accuses the vineyard; which he thus interprets, as to who was (really) intended,
when he says, &quot;<i>For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house that
is in Israel, and the men of Judah are (His) one beloved plant. I looked for
judgment, but there was rapine; and for righteousness, but behold,
howling!&quot;</i>&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The parable then, spoken by our Saviour, was so like to that of the
Prophet, that it was known to point out those who were present and heard (it).
But, it was not of the vineyard that it was spoken, because the Prophet <A HREF="#237"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|237</SPAN></A>
had already made his prediction of this. The things however, which were not
mentioned in the Prophet, He supplied in His parable: those, I say, which
respected the husbandmen of the vineyard; and these were the Elders of the
people, the chief Priests, the Rulers, and Doctors: those, who indeed were the
cause to the whole congregation, that they should render evil fruit, and, on
whose account, the vineyard itself was left to destruction. That is, the whole
of their people, with their fence, was rooted up; those who formerly contended
for the people, and watched over the people, together with their place. The
Tower that was in it, was the Temple; the wine-press, the Altar. And all these
were therefore, wholly taken away, even to their foundations ; because the
husbandmen had become polluted with blood ; those (I say), who had openly slain
the servants first and last; those Prophets, who had, time after time, been sent
unto them. The Old Testament also gives its testimony (otherwise) to this
matter; and, of the Prophets, Elias who in his prayer to God says, &quot;<i>Lord,
they have slain thy Prophets, and broken down thy Altar: and I am left alone,
and they seek to take my life</i><A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>.<i>&quot; </i>Of these things
therefore does this Prophet, by his prayer, accuse the rulers of the Jewish
people. These however, the pollution of the Prophets' blood had not satisfied,
and at last they slew the Son himself, that is, <i>the Son of God! </i>Nor was
it that they knew Him not; but, when they knew fully and accurately, that He was
the heir ! These things then, our Saviour Himself delivered by parable,
respecting Himself, before His suffering. He also foretold,--by His
foreknowledge, what should come to pass; (viz.) these things when walking in the
Temple,--to those husbandmen of the vineyard of His times, the Chief Priests,
the Doctors, and the rest of those who were at the head of the people. And much
(and) openly did He, in the parable, prepare them to pronounce condemnation
against themselves : asking them in the close of the parable, and saying, &quot;<i>What
shall the Lord of the vineyard, when He comes, do to those husbandmen?&quot; </i><A HREF="#238"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|238</SPAN></A><i>
</i>And they, not yet understanding that it had been spoken of themselves, gave
judgment against themselves, saying, &quot;<i>He shall most miserably destroy
them, and shall give up the vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render to
Him the fruits in their seasons.</i>&quot;<i> </i>Jesus then said to them :
&quot; <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> <i>Have ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the
builders rejected, has become the chief corner </i>(stone) <i>of the building:
This is from the Lord, and is a miracle in our eyes</i>?&quot; Very consistently
after the prediction of His death, He pointed out, from the testimony of the
prophets, His own resurrection from the dead. For He had previously taught, that
the Son of the Lord of the vineyard should be slain by the wicked husbandmen,
and had obtained from themselves (their own) condemnation. After that, He
brought this forward : &quot; <i>The stone which the builders rejected, has
become the chief corner (stone) of the building:&quot; </i>which, in the
prophecy, had been given by way of parable on His resurrection. For,--after He
had been rejected by those husbandmen who were also the builders, He (I say),
who was (as) a precious stone, and of whom the Prophet Isaiah says, &quot;<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A><i>Behold,
I lay in Zion a choice and precious stone, the chief corner </i>(stone) <i>of
the foundation: And he, who believeth in it, shall not be ashamed</i>,&quot;<i>--</i>He
became the chief corner (stone) of another building, of which the (divine) word
has said: &quot;<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A><i>And this is a miracle in our eyes</i>:&quot; by
which He meant His Church. And thus deservedly did He, according to their own
judgment on themselves, repay them, saying, &quot; <i>The kingdom of God shall
be taken from you, and shall be given to a people, that will render the
fruits&quot; </i>(thereof) : which corresponds to this declaration (already)
mentioned, (viz.) <i>&quot;from them;&quot; </i>that He would &quot; <i>give the
vineyard to other husbandmen, who should render to Him the fruits in their
seasons.&quot; </i>For He named the <i>&quot;kingdom of God,&quot; </i>those
observances in which the worship of God consisted; and these Hedeclared, should
be taken away from those husbandmen: and (this) He has most openly shewn, and
brought to effect; <A HREF="#239"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|239</SPAN></A> giving (the vineyard) to another people, which does bring forth its fruits.
And this is the Christian people, which docs, throughout the whole creation,
bring forth the fruits, that are both conformable, and suitable, to the
observances of God; and shews this daily, both in words and works.

<p><b>15.</b> After the Parable which has already been mentioned, the word of the
Divine Scripture states, that &quot;<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A><i>When the chief Priests and
Pharisees had heard His parables, they knew that He spake against themselves,
and they sought to take Him: but they feared the people, because they held Him
as a Prophet.</i>&quot;<i> </i>&quot;<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A><i>And Jesus answered them, and
said again in a parable: The kingdom of heaven is like to a </i>(certain) <i>man,
a king, who made a </i>(marriage) <i>feast for his son, and sent his servants to
call those who had been bidden to the feast; but they would not come. And again,
he sent out other servants, and commanded them to say to those who had been
bidden: Behold, my dinner is ready, my fatted oxen are slain, and every thing is
prepared for you : Come to the feast. But they disregarded and went away, One to
the village (farm), and Another to (his) merchandise. But they who remained
seized his servants, and abused and slew (them). And the king was enraged, and
sent his army and slew those murderers, and burnt up their city. He then said to
his servants, My dinner is ready, but those who were bidden were unworthy of it.
Go ye out therefore, into the ways and paths, and every one that ye find, call
to the feast. So those servants went out into the ways, and they brought
together all they could find, </i>(both) <i>bad and good.&quot; </i>Now, in the
former Parable, the Vineyard, the Tower, the Winepress, and the Husbandmen, were
evil: and the servants <A HREF="#240"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|240</SPAN></A> sent, first and last, were killed. And, at last, even the Son of the Lord of
the vineyard was himself slain : by which were pointed out, the People, the
Temple, the Altar, and the Rulers of the Jews; and also those wicked husbandmen,
who, standing at the head of the people, slew both the former and latter
Prophets, and at last the Son of God Himself!
</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Now the Parable before our eyes, obviously introduces the familiar feast,
and bringing together, of the Bridegroom and Bride, with a marriage-supper: and
again the servants also, who are here destroyed and slain, and the former and
latter persons bidden. By means of these again, He points out covertly, the
things that happened after His resurrection from the dead. For the Bridegroom
is, THE WORD OF GOD ; the Bride, the rational soul, which is associated with
Him, and receives the Divine seed that is of Him. And (this) Divine and rational
association, (represents) that of His Church : and, consequent upon these
things, the rational feast and marriage supper, (represent) the Divine and
heavenly aliments (so prepared). He does not here speak of the inviting
servants, with reference to those who were formerly sent to the vineyard, but,
with reference to the latter ones. For those were the Prophets; but these, His
own Apostles, who were sent forth to make the call, (and) first, of those who
were of the circumcision. For, when He first sent these forth, He charged them,
saying, &quot;<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A><i>Into the way of the Gentiles go ye not; and into a
city of the Samaritans enter ye not; but rather go ye to the wandering sheep of
the house of Israel</i>.&quot; These same persons therefore, the servants did
first invite; but, when they hearkened not to the call, He sent also, the second
time, many Evangelists and Preachers of the Gospel ; those whom He chose, after
the twelve Apostles, the seventy other Disciples, who also first preached the
Gospel to the Jewish people, and called them to the feast of the New Testament.
But they availed nothing, because they, who had been bidden, were busied with
their merchandise; and who, after they had heard the <A HREF="#241"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|241</SPAN></A>
call of the servants, abused some, and killed others. And it is in our power
to find from the Scriptures, how many of the Disciples of our Saviour they
afterwards killed, both in Jerusalem and in the rest of Judea. Stephen then was,
in the first place, forthwith slain by them by stoning. After him, James the
brother of John<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>. And again after them, he who first chose (to
accept) the throne<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> of the Church of that place, James who was called
the Brother of our Lord: whom, on account of his great excellence, they called
&quot;<i>the Just</i><A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>.&quot;<i> </i>Him too, the Jews of those times
killed by stoning. How they abused the Apostles by stripes, the Book of the Acts
relates. And these things did He, by His divine knowledge, foretel before they
happened; He also foretold the things which should befall them from the Jews. By
means of a parable too, He predicted what should come to pass before these
things took place, by these expressions, (viz.) &quot;<i>The king was
enraged&quot; </i>at the abuse and slaughter of his servants, &quot; <i>and sent
his army, and slew those murderers, and burnt up their city</i>.&quot;<i> </i>And,
What can be more obvious than this foreknowledge, and the fulfilment of the
things themselves (so predicted) ? For the army of the Romans came soon after,
and took the city, and destroyed the Temple itself by fire. And, of Whom was it,
except of Him who is King of all, God over all, that it was thus said, that
&quot;<i>the King shall send his army, and shall slay those murderers, and shall
burn up their</i> <A HREF="#242"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|242</SPAN></A> <i>city</i>?&quot; To this very time indeed, the remnants of the
conflagration which took place in various parts of the city, are obvious to the
sight of those who travel thither. But, how those murderers of the Apostles were
taken in the reduction (of the city), and suffered the punishment which they
deserved, it is not necessary we should say, as the things which were done to
them, may readily be found in the record of the Romans<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> by Flavius
Josephus<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>. After the slaughter of these therefore, and the reduction
of the metropolis of their kingdom, they,--who remained of those servants that
had first heard it said by their Lord, &quot;<i>They who were first called were
not worthy; but go ye out into the ways and paths, and all that ye find, call to
the feast&quot;--</i>performed even the thing commanded. Our Saviour said to
them therefore, after His resurrection, &quot; <i>Go ye and make Disciples of
all nations in my name,&quot; </i>And these things He said, who formerly had
commanded: &quot; <i>In the way of the Gentiles go ye not&quot; </i>but
(enjoined) that they should preach to the Jews only. But, when these had abused
(their) Inviters, then He dismissed the servants the second time, and said,
&quot; <i>Those that were called were not worthy. Go ye out into the ways and
paths, and all that ye find call to the feast.&quot; </i>And this they fulfilled
in deed. They went out into the whole creation, and they preached to all
nations, the divine and heavenly calling; and &quot; <i>they collected together
as many as they could find, </i>(both) <i>bad and good.&quot; </i>Let no one
therefore wonder, that, of those, who are collected into the Church of Christ,
all are not good; but, that in the mixture together with the good, the evil will
also be collected. Nor did this escape the foreknowledge of our Saviour. And it
is accordingly seen to remain in fact, in conformity with that foreknowledge :
and, what the end of those will be, who are brought together unworthily in His
Church, He Himself shews; for He afterwards teaches these things in the <A HREF="#243"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|243</SPAN></A>
parable, saying, <i>&quot;And</i><A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A><i> the feast was filled with
guests: but, when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had
not (on) wedding garments. And he said to him, My friend! how earnest thou in
hither not having put on wedding garments ? And he was silent. Then the king
said to the ministers: Bind him hands and feet, and cast him out into outer
darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are the called,
but few the chosen.&quot; He </i>likewise previously rebuked, with these
predictive words, those who should conduct themselves unrighteously in His
Church.&nbsp;

so that there shall come upon you, all the blood of the Righteous, which has
been shed upon the land, from the blood of Abel, even to the blood of Zecharias
the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the steps and the altar. I say unto
you, All these things shall come upon this generation</i>.&quot; There is no
need we should affirm, that all these things are so plain, as to require no
explanation whatever; which, being afterwards fulfilled in very deed, confirmed
by (their) open fulfilment, the foreknowledge of our Saviour. For the Apostles
were scourged by the Jews at a subsequent period, in Jerusalem itself; when
also, they went forth from their synagogues, <i>&quot;rejoicing</i><sup><A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A><i> </i></sup><i>that
they were found worthy to be reproached for his name's sake</i> <i>that they
were found worthy to be reproached for his name's sake</i>.&quot;<i> </i>Stephen
also was stoned by them; and James was slain with the sword<A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>; and
again, the second <A HREF="#244"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|244</SPAN></A> James was put to death with stones<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>. And Simeon, who after James
held the Episcopal chair in Jerusalem<A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>, was given up<i> </i>to
crucifixion, as the history reminds (us). And many others again, who were slain
by the Jews, have (thus) set their seal to the foreknowledge of our Saviour. On
account of all which, the judgment of God took vengeance on the generation that
dared to do all this: and, upon it turned back the (just) consequence of all its
deeds. For it was of that generation that their Temple and altar were rooted up,
and the kingdom, which had, by tradition from their forefathers, been preserved
to that very time, was dissolved. And of the same, was their freedom taken away:
and, from the effects themselves it was evident, that the avenging of the blood
of all the Righteous was on that generation, in conformity with the words of our
Saviour. It is necessary then we should see, with what entire power, and by what
sort of force, it was said, &quot;<i>Behold </i>I <i>send to you Prophets, and
Wise men.&quot; </i>For (this), &quot;<i>Behold </i>I <i>send&quot; </i>is an
intimation of the power of God. And, that He called the Rulers of the Jews to
their face, a &quot;<i>generation of vipers,&quot; </i>affords no proof of
deficiency (in this respect). The prediction too, of the destruction which
should overtake them, does, after all the rest, afford ample confirmation as to
these declarations; and this their complete fulfilment proves<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>. These
things are therefore sufficient (here). Let us then, <A HREF="#245"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|245</SPAN></A>
now enquire accordingly, how it happened to the land which had always been
precious to them, and to those glories of the metropolis of the kingdom which
had been (so) famous with them; of which, by His divine foreknowledge He
attested ;--weeping bitterly as He did over them of his mercy,--that the whole
should undergo a change to the extremes of calamity, because of the insolence of
its inhabitants against Him.

<blockquote>
<p><i>On the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>18.</b> What the end of those things should be, which had been foretold
respecting the Jewish people, has (already) been said and shewn. But, as He, THE
WORD OF GOD, prophesied also respecting these places themselves, it is necessary
we should see His words on them. Now, when the Rulers of the Jews would not bear
the purity of His Doctrine, its publication, nor His rebukes, they so acted as
to rid their city of Him. He then, leaving Jerusalem, pronounced these words
over their city: &quot;<A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A><i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem! that hast killed the
Prophets, and stoned them that were sent unto thee, How often would I have
gathered thy children together, as the hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings : but ye would not. Behold I your house is left desolate. For I say unto
you, that ye shall not see me henceforth until ye shall say, Blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord.&quot; </i>Impurity (and) pollution afterwards
marked their doings: and this was the sin in which they dared to persist against
our Saviour. And it was right, not only that the Inhabitants of the city, but
also the land itself,--in which they so greatly boasted.--should be made to
suffer the things, which the deeds of its inhabitants deserved. And these they
did suffer ! For it was not long, before the Romans came against the city: and,
of the inhabitants, some they killed by the law of war; others they destroyed by
famine; others they led away captive ; and others they persecuted. The captive<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
(City) and Temple they burnt, and reduced to utter <A HREF="#246"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|246</SPAN></A>
desolation ! But the things which took place afterwards, did our Saviour, from
his foreknowledge as THE WORD or GOD, foretel should come to pass, by means of
those which are (now) before us. For He named the whole Jewish people, <i>the
children of the City; </i>and the Temple, He styled <i>their House. </i>And thus
He testified, that they should, on their own wicked account, bear the vengeance
thus to be inflicted. For many times would He have gathered their children
together beneath the yoke of the worship of God, just as all formerly was; even
as He had from ancient times been careful for them, and had, during all ages,
instructed them by one or other of the Prophets, and called them, but they would
not hearken to his call;--on this account, He gave judgment against them, and
said, &quot;<i>Behold your house is left desolate.&quot; </i>It was therefore
with special care that He said, not (only) the City itself should be desolate,
but the House that was within it: that is, the Temple; (and) which He was
unwilling should again be called His, or yet &quot;the House of God,&quot; but
theirs (only). He prophesied too, that it should be desolate in no other way,
than as deprived of that providential care, which was formerly exerted over it:
hence He said, &quot;<i>Behold your house is left desolate.&quot; </i>And, it is
right we should wonder at the fulfilment of this prediction, since at no time
did this place undergo such an entire desolation as this was. Not at the time
when it was rased to its foundations by the Babylonians, on account of their
great wickedness, their worshipping of Idols, and pollution in the blood of the
Prophets. For seventy years was the whole period of the desolation of the place
in those times: because it was not (thus) fully said to them at that time,
&quot;<i>Behold your House is left desolate.&quot; </i>Nor was it (then so)
forsaken; an event happening soon after, which dignified it with a renewal much
more illustrious than its former state, as one of the Prophets had foretold :
(viz.) &quot;<i>The glory of this latter House shall be greater than that of the
former</i><A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>.&quot; After the enouncement therefore of our
Saviour,--that they should so be <i>left, </i>and their house come, by the
judgment of God, to utter desolation ;--to <A HREF="#247"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|247</SPAN></A>
those who visit these places, the sight itself affords the most complete
fulfilment of the prediction. The period too has been that of many years, and
(of duration) so long, as not only to be double of the desolation of seventy
years,-- which was that in the time of the Babylonians,--but even to surpass
four times (its duration) ; and (thus) confirming the judgment pronounced by our
Saviour. Again, on another occasion, our Saviour--walking by the side of the
Temple, just mentioned, and His Disciples wondering at the building which
surrounded it, and pointing out to Him the greatness and beauty of the same
Temple;--returned to them answer and said, &quot;<i>Behold! see ye not all
these things ? I say unto you, stone shall not be left here upon stone, which
shall not be thrown down</i>.&quot;<i> </i>The Scriptures do moreover shew, that
the whole building and the extreme ornamenting of the Temple there, were indeed
thus worthy of being considered miraculous: and, for proof (of this), there are
preserved, even to this time, some remaining vestiges of these its ancient
decorations. But, of these ancient things, the greatest miracle of all is, the
Divine word (declaring) the foreknowledge of our Saviour, which fully enounced
to those, who were wondering at the buildings (of the Temple), the judgment,
that there should not be left in the place at which they were wondering, &quot;<i>one
stone upon another which should not be rased&quot; </i>For it was right, that
this place should undergo an entire destruction and desolation, on account of
the audacity of its Inhabitants; because it was the residence of impious men.
And, just as the prediction was, are the results in fact remaining: the whole
Temple, and its walls,--as well as those ornamented and beautiful buildings
which were within it, and which exceeded all description,--have suffered
desolation from that time to this! With time too, this increases : and, so has
the power of THE WORD gone on destroying, that, in many places, no vestige of
their foundations is now visible! which any one who desires it, may see with his
own eyes<A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>. And, should any <A HREF="#248"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|248</SPAN></A>
one say, that a few of the places are still existing; we may nevertheless,
justly expect the destruction of these also, as their ruin is daily increasing:
the predicting word, just mentioned, daily operating by a power which is unseen.
I know too--for I have heard it from persons who interpret the passage before
us differently,--that this was not said on all the buildings, except only on
that place which the Disciples, when expressing their wonder upon it, pointed
out to Him ; for it was upon this that He spoke the predicting word. Again, the
Scriptures of His Disciples which teach respecting Him, (teach) us these things
(following), on the utter destruction of the place.--

<p><b>19.</b> &quot;<i>And</i><A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A><i>, when He saw the city, He wept over it,
and said, If thou hadst known, even in this day the things of thy peace.--But
now, they are (so) hidden from thine eyes, that the days shall come upon thee,
in which thine enemies shall surround thee, and shall press upon thee from every
part of thee: and they shall utterly root thee up, and thy children within
thee.&quot; </i>The things, prior to these, were predicted respecting the
Temple; these, which are now before us, respecting the City itself; which the
Jews named the City of God, because of the Temple of God that had been built
within it. Over the whole of this then, the compassionate (Saviour) wept. It was
not, that He had so much pity on the buildings, nor indeed upon the land, as He
had first upon the souls of its inhabitants, and (then) upon (the prospect of)
their destruction. He pointed out moreover, the cause of their desolation when
He said, &quot;<i>If thou hadst known, even in this day, the things of thy
peace:&quot; </i>intimating too His own coming, which should be for the peace of
the whole world. For <A HREF="#249"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|249</SPAN></A> this is He, of whom it was said, &quot;<i>In his days shall righteousness
arise </i>(as the sun), <i>and abundance of peace</i><A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A><i>.
</i>He
came also for this purpose, that &quot;<i>He</i><A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A> <i>might preach
peace to them that were near, and to them that were afar off.&quot; </i>And, of
them who received Him, He said, &quot;<i>Peace</i><A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A><sup><i> </i></sup><i>I leave
to you</i> <i>I leave to you</i>; <i>my peace give I unto you:&quot; </i>the
peace, which all nations who believed on Him throughout the whole creation, have
received. But the people, who were of the circumcision and believed not on Him,
knew not the things of their peace : and, on this account, He said afterwards,
&quot;<i>It is now </i>(so) <i>hidden from thine eyes, that the days shall come
upon thee, (in which) thine enemies shall surround thee</i><A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>.&quot;<i>
</i>The things (I say), which were therefore to take hold on them, a short time
after, in the reduction (of the city) : (and), because they had no previous
perception of the peace, that had been formerly preached to them, it should now
be concealed from their eyes. They had therefore, no previous perception of any
thing, which should afterwards befall them; He then plainly foretold these
things by His foreknowledge, and gave open intimation of the reduction (of the
city), which should come upon them through the Romans, (when saying), &quot;<i>The
days shall come upon thee...because thou knewest not the things of thy
peace.&quot; </i>For, for this cause &quot;<i>there shall come upon thee the
days, </i>(in which) <i>thine enemies shall surround thee, and shall go round
about thee, and shall press upon thee from every quarter of thee; and they shall
root thee out, and thy children within thee</i><A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>.&quot;<i> </i>In
these (words) then, has been recorded the form of war which should come upon
them. And, how they were fulfilled, we shall presently find from the writings of
Josephus, who was himself a Jew, and descended from a tribe of the Jews ;--one
of the well known and famous men among that people. At the time of the reduction
(of the place), he committed to writing every thing that was done among them;
and (so) shewed, that the predictions before us were, in their facts, fulfilled.

upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trampled on by the Gentiles,
until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled.&quot; </i>Previous to this
He said, &quot;<i>Behold your house is left desolate.</i>&quot; He now gives by
the words before us, the signs of the times of the final destruction of the
place; and these He shews, saying, &quot;<i>When ye shall see Jerusalem
surrounded by an army, thence know ye that its desolation is near.&quot; </i>Now,
let no one imagine, that, after the reduction of the place, and the desolation
that should be in it, another renewal of it shall take place, as it was in the
times of Cyrus, king of the Persians; and afterwards in those of Antiochus
Epiphanes; <A HREF="#251"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|251</SPAN></A> and again, in those of Pompey. For many times did this place suffer
reduction, and was afterwards dignified by a more excellent restoration. But,
when ye shall see it reduced by armies, know ye that which comes upon it, to be
a final and full desolation and destruction<A HREF="#67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>. He designates the
desolation of Jerusalem, by the destruction of the Temple, and the laying aside
of those services which were, according to the law of Moses, formerly performed
within it. You are not to suppose, that the desolation of the city, mentioned in
these (words), was to be such that no one should any more reside in it: for He
says after this, that the city shall be inhabited, not by the Jews, but by the
Gentiles, when speaking thus, &quot;<i>And Jerusalem shall be trampled on by the
Gentiles</i><A HREF="#68"><SUP>68</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>It was known therefore to Him, that it
should be inhabited by the Gentiles. But He styled this its <i>desolation </i>(viz),
because it should no more (be inhabited) <A HREF="#252"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|252</SPAN></A>
by its own children, nor should the service of the law he established within
it. And, how these things have been fulfilled, many words are not wanted (to
shew) ; because, we can easily see with our own eyes, how the Jews are dispersed
into all nations; and, how the inhabitants of that which was formerly
Jerusalem,--but is now named Aelia by Aelius Hadrian,--are foreigners, and the
descendants of another race. The wonder therefore of the prophecy is this, that
He said of the Jews, &quot;<i>they should be led captive into all nations;&quot;
</i>and, of the Gentiles, &quot;<i>that Jerusalem should be trampled on by
them.&quot; </i>This miracle is then complete : the Jews being now fully
(dispersed) throughout the whole creation, so that they are (found) remaining
among the Ethiopians, the Scythians, and in the extremities of the earth. It is
only their own city, and the place in which their worship formerly was (carried
on), that they cannot enter<A HREF="#69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>! But, if the city itself had been
utterly desolated, and without inhabitants, men would have thought that this was
the cause (of their exclusion from it). Now however, that the place is inhabited
by foreigners, the descendants of a different race, and that it is not allowed
to them alone even to set a foot in it, so that they cannot view even from a
distance the land of their forefathers<A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A>; the things foretold of it
are fulfilled, in exact accordance with the prediction: (viz). &quot;<i>They
shall be led captive into all nations, and Jerusalem shall be trampled on by the
Gentiles</i>&quot;<i> </i>The manner moreover of the captivity, points out the
war. of which He spoke; &quot;<i>For </i>(said He) <i>there shall be (great)</i><A HREF="#71"><SUP>71</SUP></A><i>
tribulation upon the land, and great wrath upon this people : and they shall
fall by the edge of the sword.&quot; </i>We <A HREF="#253"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|253</SPAN></A>
can learn too, from the writings of Flavius Josephus, how these things took
place in their localities, and how those, which had been foretold by our
Saviour, were, in fact, fulfilled. He also shews plainly the fulfilment of the
prediction of our Saviour, when He said, &quot;<i>Woe to those that are with
child, and to them that give suck in those days</i><A HREF="#72"><SUP>72</SUP></A>.&quot;<i> </i>For
he has put it on record, how the women roasted their children by the fire and
ate them, on account of the pressure of the famine which prevailed in the city.
This famine therefore, which took place in the city, our Saviour foresaw, and
counselled His Disciples that, in the reduction which was about to come upon the
Jews, it was not for them to take refuge in the city as in a place guarded and
preserved by God, but in which many should suffer ; but, that they should depart
thence, and &quot;<i>flee to the mountains</i>;&quot;<i> </i>and, that those,
who should be within Judea, should give up to the Gentiles; and those, who were
in its lands, should not take refuge in it as in a fortified place. On this
account He said, &quot;<i>Let those who are in its borders</i><A HREF="#73"><SUP>73</SUP></A><i>
not enter into it, since these are the days of vengeance, that all may be
fulfilled which has been written</i>.&quot;<i> </i>Any one therefore, who
desires it, may learn the results of these things from the writings of Josephus.
And, if it is right we should lay down a few things from him in this book, by
way of testimony, there is nothing that should hinder us from hearing the
historian himself, who writes in this manner;--
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>From the sixth Book of Josephus</i><A HREF="#74"><SUP>74</SUP></A>.

<p>21. &quot;And, How can it be necessary, that I should describe the severity of the famine, as to things inanimate?
I come then to the making known of a fact, the like of which has not been recorded, either among the Greeks,
or the Barbarians : one which, it is shocking to mention, and, to the
hearing, incredible. I myself indeed, would <A HREF="#254"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|254</SPAN></A>
gladly have left this calamity (unmentioned)--that I might not be thought by
those who shall come after, to have related falsehoods,--had I not had many
witnesses among those of our own times. I should indeed otherwise have rendered
but a doubtful good, as to the land of my fathers, had I omitted to mention the
things which, it has, in fact, suffered. A certain woman, of those who resided
on the other side of the Jordan,--whose name was Mirian, well known on account
of her family and wealth,--took refuge with many (others) in Jerusalem, and
with them was shut up (in the siege). This woman's other possessions, as they
were after she left the passage (of the Jordan) and came into the city, the
Tyrants seized. The residue of her treasures moreover, should it have sufficed
for her daily sustenance, was invaded and seized by the attendant soldiers.
Grievous indignation therefore, took possession of her; and many times did she
excite the robbers against herself, by curses and reproaches. But, when no one
put her to death.--either on account of her indignation or in mercy; and she
became weary of seeking sustenance for others from every quarter, and (as)
suspicion was excited against her, even if she found (it) : hunger, at the same
time, remaining in her bowels, and indignation inflaming her more than
hunger;--she took for her counsellor impetuosity and necessity, and dared to do
that which was contrary to nature. She seized upon her son,--for she had a
sucking infant,--and said, &quot;Wretched (babe) ! for Whom do I preserve thee
in war, famine, and tumult?-- that thou shouldest be a slave to the Romans ? If
thou shouldest indeed live happily with them, still famine precedes (this)
servitude ; and the seditious are cruel. Come ; be thou thou to me for food; to
the seditious, the vengeance;--and to the world, the tale which alone is
wanting to (complete) the sufferings of the Jews ! And, saying this, she at once
killed her son. She then roasted him, and ate a part of him ! the rest she hid,
and kept<A HREF="#75"><SUP>75</SUP></A>!&quot; <A HREF="#255"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|255</SPAN></A>
These sufferings out of many, I have here set down on account of the Divine
prediction of our Saviour, which declared, &quot;<i>Woe to them that are with
child, and to them that give suck in those days:</i>&quot; and because it adds
this also to the predictive words of our Saviour, &quot;<i>There shall be great
tribulation on the land, and great wrath upon this people</i>:&quot;<i> </i>or,
as Matthew has said<A HREF="#76"><SUP>76</SUP></A>, <i>&quot;For there shall be at that time great
tribulation, the like of which has not been since the beginning of the world,
even until now ; nor shall be&quot; </i>(hereafter). It will be well therefore,
to hear this writer himself, when thus putting on record the fulfilment of these
same things.

their iniquities singly; we say then summarily, that no (other) city (ever)
suffered all these things; and, that there never was a generation so fruitful in
vices as this<A HREF="#78"><SUP>78</SUP></A> : for they destroyed the city itself<A HREF="#79"><SUP>79</SUP></A>! and
(were the cause) that the Romans should be recorded,-- as forced by them

Temple ; and viewed from the upper city, the fire that was burning within
it.&quot; Nor were they pained, nor did they weep at these things ! Because, <i>&quot;there
should be at that time great tribulation, such, that its like existed not since
the beginning of the world.&quot; </i>This very thing was foretold by our
Saviour, which this writer attests ! the whole of which was fully brought to
pass<sup>1</sup> forty years afterwards, in the times of Vespasian the Roman
Emperor. Our Saviour moreover, added to His predictions,--determining the
time,--how long Jerusalem should be trampled on by the Gentiles; for He said,
&quot;<i>Until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled:&quot; </i>intimating
by this, the end<A HREF="#80"><SUP>80</SUP></A> of the world.

<p><b>23.</b> On the side of this our neighbouring city Neapolis of Palestine,--which
was not small, but is even (now) a city of celebrity,--a woman of Samaria drew
near to Him ; and, after other words, said to Him, &quot;<i>Sir, I perceive that
thou art a Prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this</i> <A HREF="#257"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|257</SPAN></A>
<i>mountain; but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where </i>(men) <i>ought
to worship.&quot; </i>Upon which, our Saviour returning this answer, said to
her, &quot;<i>Believe me woman, the hour cometh </i>(in) <i>which, neither in
this mountain, nor in Jerusalem shall they worship the Father.&quot; </i>And,
after a few other things, He said : &quot;<i>The hour cometh, and now is, (in)
which the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for
the Father seeketh even such as these to worship Him. God is a, spirit, and it
is right that those who worship Him, should worship him in spirit and in truth</i><A HREF="#81"><SUP>81</SUP></A>.&quot;
<i>And, </i>by these things also, He fully proved that His foreknowledge was not
small. For formerly, in the days of Tiberius the Roman Emperor,--in whose times
these things were said,--the Jews were particularly collected together in
Jerusalem, for the observance of the precepts of their Law; and the Samaritans,
on the mount called Gerizim which they honoured, on the side of Neapolis,
affirming that it was right the Law of Moses should there be observed. Now,
these mounts are, as it were, anathemas of God. With both, certain parts were
honoured; and of both, the Scripture of each bears record ; that of Moses,
respecting Gerizim ; and those of the Hebrew Prophets, respecting Jerusalem<A HREF="#82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>.
The sentence of judgment therefore, put forth in the Divine enouncement of our
Saviour was, That no more, either in Jerusalem, or on mount Gerizim, should
those henceforth worship, who then adhered so pertinaciously to these places :
which came to pass soon after. (For), in the days of Titus Vespasian, and in the
reduction which happened in those of Hadrian, both these mounts were, according
to His words, desolated. That on the side of the city Neapolis, was defiled by
unbecoming Images, by Idols, <A HREF="#258"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|258</SPAN></A> by Sacrifices, and the shedding of blood, and (thus) rendered abominable. The
Temple also of Jerusalem was rased to the foundations, and has remained, during
the whole of the time mentioned, in utter desolation and (destruction by)
burning. And, from that time and even until now, has the prediction of our
Saviour been fulfilled, which declared, &quot; <i>The hour cometh, </i>(in) <i>which
neither in this mount, nor in Jerusalem shall they worship,&quot; </i>He terms
the time (meant) <i>&quot;the hour;&quot; </i>which was not yet at hand, but was
about to be. And, speaking to His Disciples on the rational service to be
completed by Himself, He added, &quot; <i>The hour cometh, and now is, that the
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth</i>.&quot;<i> </i>He
necessarily added therefore here, <i>It </i>&quot;<i>now is.&quot; </i>For
immediately, from the very hour (in) which he said these words, (viz.) &quot; <i>The
true worshippers&quot;--</i>of whom He was the Head and Teacher,--His
Disciples, who received the rational service,--from Him, did perform the
service of God, <i>&quot;in spirit and in truth.&quot; </i>But the thing, above
all (others) prophesied of in these words, implies, that no more on any mount,
nor in any distinct corner of the earth, but throughout the whole creation,
should those &quot; <i>true worshippers</i>&quot;<i> </i>worship the God who is
above all, and should present to Him the Divine services, which should be
performed without blood, <i>&quot;in spirit and truth.&quot; </i>Not by
similitude, nor by those things of which He was the antitype, as were those of
Moses observed by both Jews and Samaritans, in slaughter, sacrifices, incense,
fire, and many other bodily modes;--that all of these should be abolished
through the things now before us, did THE WORD OF GOD here predict. He also
said, henceforth &quot;<i>in spirit and truth.&quot; </i>That is, &quot;<i>the
true worshippers&quot; </i>shall render to God, the service which is worthy of
Him, in a manner divine and with both the soul and mind.

known me, so know I the Father....And I</i> <i>lay down my life </i>(lit.
self) <i>for my sheep. And I have other sheep, those who were not of this fold;
and it is necessary that I should bring in these, and that they should hear my
voice. And there shall be one flock and one shepherd.&quot; </i>By other words
(too) He taught and said, &quot;<i>I am not come, but to the sheep that have
strayed of the house of Israel</i><A HREF="#84"><SUP>84</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>It was the Jewish
people then, that He named under this figure; but, by the things before us, He
predicted, that it was not those only who had become His disciples from among
the Jews, that were considered (as) of the number of His flock; but those also
who were without this fold. For thus, the word (Scripture) usually names at one
time, the whole Jewish people; at another, Jerusalem, and the service there
performed according to the Law of Moses.--That &quot;<i>He would collect other
sheep which were not of that fold&quot; </i>implies the whole creation; and He
foretold by these things, that out of them (this) rational flock should be so
brought together to Him, that to the one and self-same worship of God, all,
(both) Jews<A HREF="#85"><SUP>85</SUP></A> and Idolaters believing in Him, should come over; and,
that there should be &quot; <i>one flock and one Shepherd.&quot;<sup> </sup></i>This
is His Church, which has been established both from among the Jews, and
Gentiles. And thus, has it come to pass ! For at once, at the outset of the
preaching of the Gospel, great multitudes of the Jews were convinced that He was
the Christ of God, who had been preached of by the Prophets. And with these,
(those), who believed on Him from among the Gentiles, were brought together in
one Church, under the hand of the one Shepherd,--of Him who is THE WORD or GOD.
For in Jerusalem itself arose, from among the Jews, one after another fifteen
bishops of the Church there, from James who was the first<A HREF="#86"><SUP>86</SUP></A>. There
were too thousands, at once both of Jews and Gentiles there, who had been
brought together, even to the time of <A HREF="#260"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|260</SPAN></A>
its reduction in the days of Hadrian. And, that He was the (good) Shepherd
who had been many times preached of in the words of the Prophets, it is obvious
to us: the words (I say), which mention THE WORD OF GOD and teach, that He is
the Shepherd of the souls of men, as of rational flocks. For it is thus said on
one occasion by the Prophets: &quot; <i>The Lord feedeth me </i>(as a shepherd),
<i>and I shall lack nothing</i><A HREF="#87"><SUP>87</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>And on another; <i>&quot;Shepherd
of Israel look, </i>(thou) <i>who leadest Joseph as a flock</i><A HREF="#88"><SUP>88</SUP></A><i>:&quot;
</i>and, on another, He introduces (one) saying, <i>&quot;He is the Lord, and
the Shepherd of the sheep</i><A HREF="#89"><SUP>89</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>He therefore alone, is
truly declared to be the Shepherd of rational souls. For, just as the case is
among men, the nature of the sheep is one, and that of the shepherd another;
and, (as) the rational nature rules and leads that which is irrational; so also
is it with respect to the superiority of the Shepherd (here), THE WORD OF GOD,
the nature far excels that of man. We indeed are His flock, and, as compared
with His power, we are less rational than any sheep. But He is in truth the good
and pure Shepherd, who does not so neglect His flock, that it may be devoured by
the wolves; that is to say, by the wicked demons, the corrupters of souls. This
constrains us to look to His word which declared, with great power and might,
&quot;<i>I</i> <i>am the good Shepherd</i>;&quot; and which also said, &quot;<i>I
lay down my life for my sheep.&quot; </i>(This) He said in a mystery respecting
His death. He also taught at the same time the cause; viz. that it was for the
redemption of the souls of the rational flocks, that He (so) gave His life. And
this also: &quot;<i>I</i> <i>have other sheep,&quot; </i>shews, that the Jews
were not His only possession; but also, that the whole of the nations had been
given to Him of His Father, according to this (declaration), &quot;<i>Ask of me,
and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance.&quot; </i><A HREF="#261"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|261</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p><b>25.</b> He was often with the Jews, because to them were known the predictions of
the Prophets respecting Him. But, because the Greeks upon one occasion also
approached His Disciples, desiring to see Him,--it is written, that, when they
had told Him this, He said: &quot;<A HREF="#90"><SUP>90</SUP></A><i>The hour is come, that the Son
of Man should be glorified. I say unto you, that unless the grain of wheat fall
into the earth and die, it will remain alone; but if it </i>(so) <i>die, it will
bring forth much fruit.&quot; </i>By these things also) He obviously declared in
a mystery, that, among the Greeks, among foreign nations and the children of a
different generation, those things which comprehended the praises of His Godhead
should be embraced. For it was not when He was among the Jews that he said,
&quot;<i>His hour had come that He should be glorified,&quot; </i>but, when the
Greeks<A HREF="#91"><SUP>91</SUP></A><sup> </sup>drew near to Him. After this, he necessarily continued
shewing of His own death, His resurrection, and of the calling of the people,
among whom He then was. For, just as the grain of wheat, before it falls into
the earth, remains alone, but contains the life-producing-power, with the
energies<A HREF="#92"><SUP>92</SUP></A> of the seed included within it, (and) which the ears shall
produce; but, after falling into the earth,--just as that which lives after
death,--it will increase, and, from the power vested within it, produce many
ears of corn; so did He also declare respecting Himself, that the things should
be. And this indeed, the result of them has plainly evinced. <A HREF="#262"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|262</SPAN></A>
For, it was not the Greeks alone who, after His death, received of His power
and of the provisions of His Godhead, but also many nations. He was therefore,
that seed which fell, and sprang up again, &quot;<i>He who was dead, but is
alive</i><A HREF="#93"><SUP>93</SUP></A>.&quot; He, who after His fall which was by death,
increased greatly, is He who has, by His resurrection, filled the lands of the
heathen, as it were cultivated fields, with the Divine unutterable power. On
this account He said, &quot;<i>The harvest</i><A HREF="#94"><SUP>94</SUP></A> <i>is great, but the
labourers are few.&quot; </i>And again, <i>&quot;Lift</i><A HREF="#95"><SUP>95</SUP></A><i> up your eyes
and see the fields, that they are white for the harvest.&quot; </i>These things
He also foretold (figuratively), of those who should after His death establish
themselves in Him, through the pure faith which is by Him; the multitude of whom
should, throughout the whole creation both of Greeks and Barbarians, constitute
the Church to be established in myriads of congregations ;--collected together,
as it were, (the produce of) rational well-cultured fields, into one place ;
(that is) the souls of men, into the granaries of His Church. Hence it has been
said, <i>&quot;He</i><A HREF="#96"><SUP>96</SUP></A><i> whose fan is in His hand, and who will
cleanse His floor, and collect the wheat into </i>(His) <i>treasuries: but the
straw He will burn with fire unquenchable.&quot;</i>

Peter: &quot;<A HREF="#99"><SUP>99</SUP></A><i>I</i> <i>say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
girdedst thy loins, and wentest whither</i> <A HREF="#263"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|263</SPAN></A>
<i>thou wouldest ; but, when thou shalt have become old, thou shalt stretch
forth thy hands, and others shall gird thy loins for thee, and shall lead thee
whither thou shalt not be willing. And these things which He said </i>(were) <i>to
shew, by what death he should glorify God. And, when He had said this, He said
to him, Follow me&quot; </i>And, Who is not astonished, that, when He said these
things to His Disciples, they should be prepared and ready to adhere to Him even
to death ? For He did not deceive them by intimating, or promising to them, the
things considered good in this life ; nor did He by any such means, allure them
to give their adhesion to Him ; but, He simply foretold those obvious tortures
which should, on His account, befall them. And (so) He previously shewed to
Simon the mode of crucifixion, by which he afterwards closed his life in the
city of Rome, in this which He said, &quot;<i>When thou shalt have become old,
thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and others shall gird thy loins for
thee.&quot; </i>And similarly, He also shewed mystically in this which He said,
&quot;<i>Whither I go. thou canst not now come; but, after a time, thou shalt
come.&quot; </i>Now, these things were not said to them all, but only to Peter ;
because it is he alone, who, in the Scripture, (is said) should end his life
after the manner of the suffering of our Saviour.

this, (viz.) the additional word here saying, <i>&quot;for my sake.&quot; </i>For
it was not sufficient, that He should only foreknow and foretel the persecutions
<A HREF="#264"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|264</SPAN></A> which should arise against His Disciples; but, that He might also shew the
cause of these, He said, <i>they should suffer these things for His sake. </i>Nor
was it on account of any evil practices, nor yet for any other fault;
but,--(as) He previously testified,--that every thing (of this sort) should
befall them <i>for His sake: </i>which is present in the fact for our
information ! For if any one, during the time of the persecutions, denied only
that he was a Christian, he was released from all blame and cause of accusation.
But, so irreprehensible and sinless were the lives of His Disciples to be, that
they should suffer every sort of calamity for no other cause, except only their
confessing, and giving testimony to, Him. He did indeed, fully stir up and
make'them ready (for this), by comparing them with the ancient Prophets and
Friends of God ; <i>for</i><A HREF="#102"><SUP>102</SUP></A>,<i> </i>(said He), <i>even as they
persecuted the Prophets who were before you, so shall they, without cause, drive
you out; and, after the manner of the Prophets, shall ye be punished, because ye
worship the God who is over all; on which account, they also persecuted the
Prophets. </i>Now that He should foretel, that even governours and kings should
be moved by these things; that the time was then at hand; that He should (so)
speak with His Disciples; and that His words should so come to pass and remain
in fact, How greatly does it exceed (all) wonder ? For there have been many
others, both Barbarians and Greeks, who have said and promised many wise things
to their Disciples. Of these, some supposed that there was no God; others
annihilated every consideration about Providence; and others (received) those
who were thought Gods by the many: others arose (as) the leaders of vicious
factions; others (who thought), that <i>Rest</i><A HREF="#103"><SUP>103</SUP></A> was the extreme
(good) : and others, that <i>Rest </i>indiscriminately was; and who indeed
talked just as they might be circumstanced. But never did any one of these, <A HREF="#265"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|265</SPAN></A>
previously determine such things for His Disciples. Nor do we know of any
persecutions that opposed them, such as those were that opposed the teaching of
our Saviour. How then shall we not wonder, and confess, that these are indeed
the words of God ?--these (I say), which not only previously attested, through
the Divine foreknowledge, the persecutions which should come upon His Disciples;
but also, previously pointed out the cause of these, by this which He said, that
<i>these things should happen to them, for His sake?</i>

things have, even to the present time, been fulfilled in fact, What need is
there that we should shew at length, since these facts are superior to all
report ? We have seen too with our own eyes, how many things of this sort took
place, both during the persecutions, and in our own times. Nor do you simply
hear this, that &quot;<i>the brother should deliver his brother to death</i>;&quot;
for even this might have been as any mere matter of opinion. But we can
investigate (the case), and inform ourselves how it was, that &quot;<i>the
brother delivered his brother to death.&quot;-- </i>When one surrenders himself
to fraternal affection, and chooses the love of life, and denies God, and
particularly with respect to his brother, whom he will solicit and persuade to
worship idols; will excite and inveigle, putting forth (his) fraternal
affection, so as to make him disregard the command of our Saviour; then indeed,
will <i>the</i> <A HREF="#266"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|266</SPAN></A> <i>brother deliver up his brother to the death of his soul. </i>In like
manner also, will the father cause his son to err (by enticing), and will

<i>the children, their parents: </i>they will, through their affection for them,

than that which is with God; and will (so) become the cause, both of the death
and perdition of the soul of their parents<A HREF="#105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>. And many such things as
these, did we witness with our own eyes, during the times of the persecutions ;
so that in them was fulfilled the (prediction) : &quot;<i>Ye shall be hated of
all men for my name's sake.&quot; </i>In this place also was this addition
carefully made, teaching the Disciples that, it should not be for any hateful
deed, but for <i>His name's sake, they should be hated.</i>

a figure for the word,-- and which is woven (as it were) from the various mind
of the old and new Scriptures, He names His own doctrine : the fluctuating life

attending it, &quot;<i>the sea.&quot; </i>Out of this (sort of) life, as from
the sea, the &quot;<i>net,&quot; </i>so foretold, was to catch up tens of
thousands. And under it were to be (taken), the various multitudes of those
opposed <A HREF="#267"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|267</SPAN></A> to each other in their characters; and of these, the good and bad in their
dispositions. Of these too he spoke mystically, as being caught up from the sea
after the manner of fish, when He said in the first calling of His Disciples,
&quot;<i>Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men</i><A HREF="#107"><SUP>107</SUP></A><i>.&quot;
</i>This collecting together therefore of such men, bad and good, in His
Church,--assembled (as they are) to this very time,-- was not unknown to Him :
for He taught, that these same should at last be separated by the Angels, who
should be appointed to this (work) ; and (so) should the punishment, due to the
disposition of each one, be awarded.

not gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles. So every good tree
produceth good fruit, but an evil tree giveth forth evil fruit.&quot; </i>He
(here) counselled (them) by His foreknowledge, to beware of those ungodly
persons, who, availing themselves of the <A HREF="#109"><SUP>109</SUP></A>opinions of others, and of
the words of the Scriptures of His Divinity, should in after times formally
assume the name of Christianity. He also shews the marks and vouchers of the
evil concealed within them, and which should deceive the many, when saying,
&quot;<i>By their fruits ye shall know them</i>.&quot; Now the fruits of such
are these ; the ungodly words uttered by them; their unrighteous and perverse
manner of life. These things then, when uttered and foretold by our Saviour,
afforded at that time no visible testimony whatever to those who heard them, (as
to their truth) ; but, in after times, the facts (so) declared became openly
visible to all: the followers accordingly of <A HREF="#268"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|268</SPAN></A>
Marcion<A HREF="#110"><SUP>110</SUP></A>, Valentinus<A HREF="#111"><SUP>111</SUP></A>, Basilides<A HREF="#112"><SUP>112</SUP></A>, and those
other corrupters of souls, sprang up, (viz.) Bardesanes<A HREF="#113"><SUP>113</SUP></A>, and that
madman in opinion of yesterday, and of our own times, whose name became the
titular badge of the Manichean<A HREF="#114"><SUP>114</SUP></A> <A HREF="#269"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|269</SPAN></A>
heresy; who all became the sources of lying and ungodly doctrine. Nor did
they otherwise come to light, but as outwardly clothed with the skins of our
Saviour's lambs. And He plainly styled His Disciples <i>&quot;sheep;&quot; </i>saying,
<i>&quot;My sheep hear my voice</i><A HREF="#115"><SUP>115</SUP></A>:<i>&quot; </i>and again, &quot;<i>Behold,
I send you as sheep among wolves</i><A HREF="#116"><SUP>116</SUP></A>.&quot; Of these then they
outwardly assumed the manner, while in themselves they were <i>&quot;rapacious
wolves.&quot; </i>(And), How many thousands of the sheep of our Saviour, did
these Deceivers snatch away ? Who, presenting their persons in form as to
Christ, attached themselves to His instruction, and to the terms of the
doctrines relating to His Godhead, and exhibited themselves as (His) lambs !
But, that ungodly bitterness<A HREF="#117"><SUP>117</SUP></A> which lay (as) in ambush within them,
adhered secretly to those who had been ensnared by them. These, therefore, who
were now thought to be &quot;<i>sheep,&quot; </i>because of their (thus) drawing
near (to Him), openly appeared afterwards to be <i>&quot;rapacious wolves.&quot;
</i><A HREF="#270"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|270</SPAN></A> And hence, our Saviour taught us previously to beware of them, when He said
by way of instruction, &quot;<i>By their fruits ye shall know them.&quot;</i>

an evil Demon, and prince of the Demons: they blasphemed our Saviour
accordingly, (affirming) that by the power of this, He expelled the rest of the
Demons from men <A HREF="#119"><SUP>119</SUP></A>. But, He returned the true answer to those who
thought this, which is also written among His words. He foretold too, to His Disciples, that they
also should be thought to overcome men, through intercourse with Demons and
Magicians: which very thing, now affirmed by the many, has sealed and confirmed
the prediction of our Saviour. He also gave His testimony, that this notion,
(so) ascribed to them, should come to nothing, from (the consideration) of their
lives, and conduct; their purity of doctrine, and that (inculcating) <A HREF="#271"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|271</SPAN></A>
the worship of God. He said therefore, &quot;<i>Fear them not; for there is
nothing hidden that shall not be revealed, nor concealed that shall not be made
known.&quot; </i>He therefore reproved these (Disciples), for a considerable
time, because the things formerly escaping the many, had, on this account, been
supposed (by them) to be incapable of publication; as also those, belonging to
the doctrines of the (true) worship of God, of being made openly known. But, His
ordinances and precepts have now been made known to every man ; and He has
extinguished that (injurious) opinion respecting them, (His Disciples) which had
formerly been held by the many<A HREF="#120"><SUP>120</SUP></A>.

</i>It is evident from the context of the Scriptures, that there never was among
men, and particularly among the Jews, any one who uttered by revelation any
thing like this ; or, who did any thing like it: or that, throughout the whole

multitudes, not of men (only), but also of women, who <A HREF="#272"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|272</SPAN></A>
kept<A HREF="#122"><SUP>122</SUP></A> themselves in perfect holiness, and the state of virginity,
through the hope and expectation of the kingdom of heaven. We have seen in the
very experiment itself,<sub> </sub>that they learned they should soon be
prepared for this. The fulfilment however, of the claim to foreknowledge, was
not simply (realized here); for we have seen many men, well known to us, who
(actually) availed themselves of the iron (knife,) and made eunuchs of
themselves for no other cause, except that of the hope of the kingdom of heaven:
who neither hesitated, nor were weak in the doctrine of our Saviour, but simply
and boldly betook themselves to the thing itself<A HREF="#123"><SUP>123</SUP></A>. So that the
foreknowledge of our Saviour, even respecting these things, sets to its seal,
that His word was in truth the word of God. <A HREF="#273"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|273</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<blockquote>
<p><i>On the distinction of those who should not worthily receive the seed of
His doctrine. </i>From the Gospel of Matthew.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>33.</b> When a great multitude of men had come near Him, He thus foretold by a
parable what those should be, who should receive the seed of His doctrine,
saying : &quot;<A HREF="#124"><SUP>124</SUP></A><i>Behold, a sower went forth to sow: and, as he
sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of heaven came and devoured it:
and some fell on the rock, where there was not much earth, and immediately it
sprang forth ; and, because there was no depth of earth beneath its root, it
dried up. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up, and choked it:
and some fell upon good ground, and it gave forth fruit, some an hundred, some
sixty, and some thirty-fold. </i>After these things He cried out and said, <i>He
that hath ears to hear, let him hear&quot; </i>After this also, He was asked by
His Disciples, what the interpretation of the parable should be; and He taught
them, saying, &quot; <i>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. Every one
that heareth the word of the kingdom, but understandeth it not,--the Evil one
cometh, and snatcheth the seed out of his heart. This is that which is sown by
the ivay side. And that which is sown upon the rock, is he who heareth the word,
and with readiness receiveth it: but, not being confirmed therein, he is
offended by a little affliction. And that which fell among the thorns, is he who
heareth the word, but the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
choke the word, and it remaineth without fruit. But that which is sown on good
ground, is he who heareth the word, and understandeth it, and produceth fruit,
some an hundred, some sixty, and some thirty-fold.&quot; </i>Now, Whence could
it have happened to human nature, not only to declare bv (one's) foreknowledge
something that should come into being; but also, to determine the kinds and
sorts of persons (who should), unless indeed He were truly THE WORD of God
?--He (I say), who at that time (so) prophesied and taught;--of whom it is
said, &quot;<i>The WORD OF GOD is lively </i>(energetic), <i>and more sharp and
cutting than the two-edged sword, and passeth even to the parts of the</i> <A HREF="#274"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|274</SPAN></A>
<i>soul and of the body, and of the joints and marrow; and is the Judge of
the thoughts and intentions of the heart, and from whom no creature is hidden</i><A HREF="#125"><SUP>125</SUP></A><i>?</i>&quot;
He well declared therefore, the distinguishing marks of those who should
afterwards receive His doctrines; and He also foretold, that those who should in
impurity receive the seed of His instruction, should be of three kinds; as
should in like manner the good, who should like good ground hear much, and give
great increase to the word itself. Of those corrupters of the seed too, which
should fall into their souls, He declared there should be three (moving) causes
: Either from the considerations of life, and the care of things not
(absolutely) necessary, and from riches and pleasures, immersing (as it were)
the seed sown within them, and making it resemble the seed choked by thorns: or,
others not receiving it into the depth of the mind, but immediately
extinguishing it when affliction overtakes them: or, the third cause may be,
that the source of the destructions of the seed within them is, the surrendering
of a lax and ready hearing to (men) wishing to seduce them, and to snatch away
the seed that had fallen into their souls. And these same are, in no other way
cut off from bearing the fruit that is of God, except as by one or other of the
means just mentioned. But those who are opposed to these, and receive the seed
of salvation into a soul that is pure, and a mind that is devoted, do again, as
their power may be, greatly increase their fruits. He moreover assimilates the
distinctions of these, to those of good and excellent lands which bring forth
some thirty, some sixty, and some an hundred-fold. For such as these powers are,
are those occasionally found in the souls of men. These things therefore, He
prophesied on these matters. But, of the <A HREF="#275"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|275</SPAN></A>
multitude of those who should in after-times bear (much) fruit, through the
instruction of His words, He thus cried out and said, &quot;<i>The harvest is
great, but the labourers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
that He would send forth labourers into His harvest</i><A HREF="#126"><SUP>126</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>And
again, of these same He said on another occasion : &quot;<i>Do not ye yourselves
say, that there are yet four months, and the harvest cometh ? Lift up your eyes,
and see the fields that they are white for the harvest</i><A HREF="#127"><SUP>127</SUP></A><i>!&quot;&nbsp;
</i>And, Who does not
wonder, that He should shew even the fewness of those who should in purity be
the chiefs of His word, for He said, &quot;<i>The labourers are few</i>?&quot;
And, as prayer was necessary for the obtaining of these, He said therefore,
&quot;<i>Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that He send forth labourers into His
harvest.&quot; </i>When He said therefore, &quot;<i>The sower went out to
sow,&quot; </i>He also said, that there was another sower, and another seed ;
and He also shewed and taught, whence, and whither, he went forth by the things
said in the parable immediately following this, which is in this form:--
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>On the teaching of Heterodoxy</i><A HREF="#128"><SUP>128</SUP></A>,<i> which should be sown
together with His word in the souls of men. </i>From the Gospel of Matthew.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>34.</b> He added another Parable, and said: &quot;<i>The kingdom of heaven is
like to a man, who sowed good seed in his field. But, when men slept, the Enemy
came and sowed Tares among the wheat, and departed. When therefore, the wheat
sprang forth and produced fruit, the Tares appeared in like manner. And his
servants drew near and said to him : Our Lord, Didst not thou sow good seed in
thy field? Whence are there Tares in it ? But he said to them, The man (who is)
the Enemy hath done this. They say to him: Is it thy will therefore, that we go
(and) gather them ? But he</i> <A HREF="#276"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|276</SPAN></A> <i>said to them, No; lest, while ye gather the Tares, ye also root up the
wheat with them. Let them both grow until the harvest. And at the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the Tares, and bind them in
bundles for burning; but gather ye the wheat into the granaries</i><A HREF="#129"><SUP>129</SUP></A>&quot;<i>
</i>(lit. treasuries). This same Parable too, He explained to His Disciples in
the house, when they drew near to Him and said, &quot;<i>Explain to us the
Parable of the Tares of the field. And He answered them, and said:</i> <i>The sower of the good seed is the Son of man; and the
field is the world. (As
to) the good seed, these are the children of the kingdom; and the Tares, those
are the children of the wicked one; and the Enemy, who sowed them, is the
Accuser. And the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the
Angels. Even therefore, as the Tares are gathered up, and fall into the fire; so
shall it be at the end of this world. The Son of man shall send His Angels, and
they shall gather out of His kingdom all offences, and those that do evil, and
shall cast them into the Gehenna</i><A HREF="#130"><SUP>130</SUP></A><i> of fire: there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. And then shall the righteous shine in the kingdom
of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear</i>.&quot;<i> </i>Our
Saviour shewed therefore, by His explanation of the Parable, these things
(viz.), who the sower that went out to sow the seed was, and what the seed was
which He cast forth, in the expressions: &quot;<i>The sower of the good seed is
the Son of man ; and the field is the world.&quot; </i>For He usually called
Himself the &quot;<i>Son of man,&quot; </i>on account of His going about among
men<A HREF="#131"><SUP>131</SUP></A>. He therefore <i>went forth </i>from <A HREF="#277"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|277</SPAN></A>
within<A HREF="#132"><SUP>132</SUP></A>, and came out. Where then was He <i>within, </i>but above
the world ? where (indeed) He existed; and in the end of the world<A HREF="#133"><SUP>133</SUP></A> <i>He
came forth, </i>and came down to us, who were <i>without </i>(out of) the
kingdom of heaven. And with Him He brought the heavenly seed, which He sowed in
the souls of men as in distinguished lands. For the Parable placed before us
teaches respecting the field, as of what sort it is, into which He cast the
seed;--which says, &quot;<i>The field is the world</i>;&quot; and it shews of
this field, that it belongs to none but Himself;--to Him who came forth from <i>the
inner part of His kingdom, </i>to those who were &quot;<i>without</i>&quot; (out
of it), when saying, &quot;<i>the servants drew near and said to Him, &quot;Our
Lord, didst not thou sow good seed in </i>THY<i> field</i>?&quot; He therefore
taught plainly, that even this field is His own : and this He interpreted and
shewed, was the world. In the former Parable therefore, He shewed His
foreknowledge as to what the distinctions of those would be, who should receive
the seed into their souls; but in this, which is placed before us, the perverse
doctrines and errors of the ungodly Hereticks: when not one of them had yet so
established himself among men! Nevertheless, it was not unknown to Him that this
should come to pass. For, as false scriptures were scattered as seed in
succeeding times throughout the whole earth, with enouncements assimilated to
those of His doctrine, by an opposing nature, not unlike the Tares (sown) among
His pure words and life-giving doctrines<A HREF="#134"><SUP>134</SUP></A>;--and there are myriads
even to this time, some of whom make their boast of Manes, some of Marcion, and
some of others, of those (I say) who put forth ungodly heterodoxy, and &quot;<i>Tares&quot;
</i>(as it were), assimilated to the doctrine of our Saviour; making use of His
name, and holding false books of the Gospels:--but he who was the Father of
these things; <A HREF="#278"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|278</SPAN></A> --he who first sowed them in the souls of those who received him, was the
Accuser himself: so He (our Saviour) well evinced, by the Divine power, the
foreknowledge of what should come to pass; and these things He previously
testified, which have been thus fulfilled in fact; and accordingly their
fulfilment was, as His words (had foreshewn). As He therefore truly shewed forth
these things, and as we see in the facts themselves, the fulfilment of these
predictions of our Saviour; so ought we also to think, that the rest shall come
to pass. And these are, <i>&quot;the harvest,&quot;&quot; &quot;the end,&quot; </i>and
<i>&quot;the angels the reapers:&quot; </i>also that the Tares shall be
gathered, and shall fall into the fire:--the extreme good things too of those,
who shall have preserved and multiplied the living, pure, and life-giving seed ;
of whom it is said, &quot;<i>Then shall the righteous shine as the sun, in the
kingdom of their Father.&quot;</i>

saying between themselves and Him, Tell us, When shall these things be ? and

these things and said, &quot;<A HREF="#138"><SUP>138</SUP></A><i>I</i> <i>am come in the name of my
Father, and ye receive me not; but, if another come in his own name, him ye will
receive.&quot; </i>These things He foretold when warning His Disciples against
the lying Antichrist, whom they were expecting: and one (of these) shewed of
another in the Epistle to the Thessalonians, who (should be) in (the time of) <i>the
end</i><A HREF="#139"><SUP>139</SUP></A>. But, that others also should be before this, our Saviour
Himself foretold in several places: &quot;<i>For many,&quot; </i>said He, &quot;<i>shall
come in my name, and shall say, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many.&quot; </i>And
there were many (such) after (these) His words. And so the Samaritans were
forthwith persuaded that Dositheus<A HREF="#140"><SUP>140</SUP></A>, who was after the times of our
Saviour, was the prophet of whom <A HREF="#280"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|280</SPAN></A> Moses predicted
<A HREF="#141"><SUP>141</SUP></A>. And he so deceived them, that they declared he
was the Christ. Others again, in the times of the Apostles, named Simon Magus
&quot;<i>the great power of God</i><A HREF="#142"><SUP>142</SUP></A>&quot;<i> </i>and thought that he
was the Christ. Others (thought the same) of Montanus<A HREF="#143"><SUP>143</SUP></A> in Phrygia:
and others again, of others, in another place. Nor did the deceivers cease. And
it is necessary we should suppose, that there were many such as these; so that
even from them, testimony may be had, as to the reality of our Saviour's
foreknowledge. Our Saviour taught moreover, that His glorious second coming
should not again be, as it was at the first, in some one place, so that it may
be supposed to be visible in some corner of the earth: and, that no one should
thus think, He said, &quot;<i>If any one shall say to you, Behold, the Christ is
here, or is there, believe ye not.&quot; </i>For opinions such as these comport
by no means with Him, but with those false Christs and false Prophets. He indeed
appeared once in the form of man, and in a certain district. But, of what sort
his glorious second coming from heaven should be, He taught and said, &quot;<i>For,
as the lightning</i> <i>goeth forth</i><A HREF="#144"><SUP>144</SUP></A><sup> </sup><A HREF="#281"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|281</SPAN></A>

acts, but <i>&quot;for my name's sake</i><A HREF="#148"><SUP>148</SUP></A>.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>37.</b> These proofs of the Divine manifestation of our Saviour, which we have
thus far seen, are at the same time demonstrative, that both the words and deeds
(had in view) are Divine. For in former times, the words were simply heard; but
now, in our times, the fulfilment of these words is openly visible in deed,
together with powers eclipsing those of all mortal nature. And, if men will not
be persuaded by these, we ought not to wonder: because it is usual with man <i>so
</i>to resist things the most plain, as even to dare to oppose by his words the
existence of an universal Providence; and hence also, to deny God himself! And
thus also, will he disingenuously contend against many other things, to which
the truth bears testimony. But, as the injurious conduct of these detracts in no
respect from the word, which is in its own nature true; so also will the wicked
unbelief of men, in no way injure the evident excellency of the Godhead of our
Saviour. But, if it is right <A HREF="#284"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|284</SPAN></A> that we should compose, for these also, a form (of prescription) conducing to
intellectual health ; it is time that we should here again present, for their
use, (other) proofs of the (truth of the) Gospel, and now also recite the
things, which have formerly been investigated with reference to other
(objectors), as to those who will not be persuaded by the things (hitherto)
said.

Matt, viii. 5. seq. with the addition of <i>&quot;beloved,&quot; </i>(Syr.
[Syriac]) from the parallel passage in Luke vii. 2. It differs considerably from
the Peschito, and is probably the rendering of our Syriac Translator, with the
words of the Peschito, however, in his memory. The greatest variety consists in
this, that our text has here, <i>Chiliarch </i>(Syr. [Syriac]) <i>Captain of a
thousand, </i>instead of <i>Centurion </i>of the Greek and Syriac Scriptures. I
have accordingly given <i>Chiliarch </i>in my translation. This reading is

any preeminence to Peter in the work of evangelizing the world, this place would

</p>
<p><A NAME="#23"></A>23.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> The place here referred to is Deut. xxxii. 8, as given in the
Version of the Septuagint: where we have, [Greek]<i> </i>Out of this seems to
have originated the notion of Angels presiding over the several regions of the
Earth: and, thence, among the heathen, of <i>Demons </i>doing this: a notion
prevailing far and wide in the East at this very day. The Hebrew has here,
&quot;<i>Children of Israel;&quot; </i>whence the notion among the Jews, that
there were 72 nations on the earth, and as many languages; because this was the
number supposed to have gone down with Jacob into Egypt. The whole however, is a
gross mistake, which has arisen out of a false interpretation of the Hebrew term
[Hebrew], signifying <i>enumeration, as </i>well as <i>number. </i>The sense of
the place will then be, <i>according to the enumeration, (account </i>or <i>statement)
of the children of Israel: </i>i. e. as found in their Scriptures. This
Scripture is also quoted, Demonstr. Evang. Lib. iv. cap. vii; but the reasoning
differs. See also ib. cap. x. p. 163. See also Origen contra Cels. Lib. v. p.
250, &amp;c. An extract is given from the <i>Theophania, </i>in the
&quot;Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio,&quot; Tom. viii. p. 91, by Signior
Angelo Mai in these words: [Greek]<i> </i>If this extract belongs to any part of
this work, it must, I suppose, be to this; as I know of no other place at all
like it, From the letter <i>Beta </i>being attached to the extract, one would imagine that the <i>second </i>Book was meant; but certainly, our
second Book contains no such matter. All I can see in it, I must confess, is,
that the writer of the Codex mentioned by Signior Mai only intended to give a
sort of Comment on this place of the Theophania, and one which seems to have
come originally from the Jews: it being much of a piece with the traditionary
nonsense entertained by that people, but quite foreign to the manner of
Eusebius, who never indulges in cabbalistic reasoning of this sort. Nor is the
Signior (now Cardinal) correct when he says:--&quot;<i>Theophania, </i>seu
publica Christi vita, (Luc. cap. 3 )&quot;: neither the term, nor the contents
of the work, nor the Scripture cited, justifying such an assertion. Nor does the
word <font face="SPIonic"> a0nefa&amp;nh|</font>,<i> </i>referred to, even hint at the existence of this
work. All the passage in the Chronicon intends evidently is, that our Lord <i>appeared
</i>(<font face="SPIonic">a0nefa&amp;nh|</font>)<i> </i>in the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar. The
Cardinal tells us moreover, that he has discovered xviii. other fragments of
this work, which he has printed in the second edition of his first volume. But
this edition I have not yet been able to find in this country; I can say nothing
therefore about these extracts.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#24"></A>24.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> A very common term, used to designate the true religion: it is
also frequently used in the Hebrew Bible in this sense.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#25"></A>25.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Alluding to the denial of Peter. Matt. xxvi. 74.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#26"></A>26.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Luke xxiv. 44. seq.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#27"></A>27.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The phraseology of the Syriac deserves notice here. It runs
thus, literally, <i>In the whole hearing </i>(i. e. understanding) <i>therefore
of all the nations has He made these His words ; being varied and translated, </i>&amp;c.
The term [Syriac] is used here, and signifies, as it does also above, Book
in. sect. 39, the understanding of languages.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#28"></A>28.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Matt. xxvi. 13, &amp;c. cited by Theodoret. Gr. affect. curat.

</p>
<p><A NAME="#29"></A>29.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The term <i>this </i>(Syr. [Syriac]) may, indeed, here refer to <i>the
</i>woman just named : I am disposed rather to think that it refers to <i>this </i>gospel,
or doctrine, termed [Syriac] above.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#30"></A>30.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Matt. xvi. 15. seq. As this passage is important, I give the
Syriac of it here, which stands thus: [Syriac]. Justin Martyr takes this passage in the same way :
(Dialog. cum Tryphone. p.
255. 48. Ed. Sylburg,) [Greek]. Euthymius gives the sense thus: Thou art Peter, as about to be a rock of the
faith, after the denial (of Christ); or, as already being <i>firm in mind: </i>thence,
<i>upon this firmness </i>I will build my Church,, or, I will lay thee (as) a
foundation of the Believers. For the Church are the Believers, &amp;c. [Greek]<i>
</i>See Hammond's admirable note on this place. It is also thus given in the
Syriac, (in this MS.) in the work of Titus Bishop of Bozrah on the Manicheans,
near the end. [Syriac] That is: &quot; <i>On this rock do I build my Church, and the
gate-bars of Hull shall not prevail against it.&quot; </i>'He calls every thing
therefore <i>gate-bars, </i>by means of which those, who should take upon
themselves a complete readiness to encounter the death of martyrdom, for the
sake of the fear of God. And, after a few other things, when Simon said to Him,'
&quot; <i>Thou art the Christ</i>,&quot; '<i>He </i>returned the answer,' &quot;
<i>Upon this rock do I build my Church.&quot; -- </i>'Upon what? Upon this
faith, that' &quot;<i>Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God.&quot; -- </i>He
goes on to say, not as the mad Manes affirms of Him, that the Messiah is the
five elements. -- He might have added, -- and probably would, had the thing
existed in his days, -- nor as the arrogant Papists do, that by
&quot;Cephas&quot; (Peter), is here meant the Popes of Rome.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#31"></A>31.&nbsp;<sup>1 </sup>Matt. x. 34. seq.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#32"></A>32.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Luke xii. 51. seq.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#33"></A>33.&nbsp; <sup>1</sup> Eusebius has, in his Eccl. Hist. occasionally mentioned this
Gospel: e. g. as apocryphal, Lib. iii. cap. xxv. [Greek]. &quot; Sed et in eundem ordinem (i.e. apocr.) jam a quibusdam relatum est
Evangelium secundum Hebraeos, quo maxime delectantur Hebraei illi qui Christi
fidem susceperunt.&quot; Again, as retained by the Ebionites and their
followers, ib. cap. xxvii. And again, as spoken of by Papias, and said by him to
have been written by Matthew, and to have contained the history of the
adulteress (John viii.) ib. cap. xxxix. And again, (Lib. iv. cap. xxii.)
Hegesippus is said to have cited some things from the Gospel of the Hebrews, and
also the Syriac one. This last however was, no doubt, one and the same with the
Hebrew one, and so called because written in the Syro-Chaldaic dialect in Hebrew
letters. It was by Jerome translated, into both the Greek and Latin languages :
a copy of the original being, in his days, preserved in the Library of Caesarea,
which had been formed by Pamphilus the Martyr and Friend of Eusebius. See Jerome
on Isaiah, cap. xi. and Matt. xviii. And the note of Valesius, p. 47. See also
Jones on the Canon of the New Testament, Vol. i. pt. 2. cap. xxv. seq. -- As
this passage of the Gospel (so called) of the Hebrews, does not appear to have
been cited by any ecclesiastical or other writer, 1 have thought it right to
give it as it stands in the Syriac.<img border="0" src="eusebius_theophania_book4.gif" width="1118" height="67"><br>
It may be remarked, that Eusebius does here cite this passage as worthy of
credit, although he does not ascribe any divine authority directly to it. Mr
Jones has, in his very excellent work on the Canon of the New Testament, affimed
that Eusebius had never so cited this Gospel--which, indeed, had not appeared
in the then known works of Eusebius. Still, this cannot be adduced, as in any
way affecting the character of our acknowledged Gospels. I am very much disposed
to think with Grotius, &amp;c. that this was the original Gospel of St. Matthew,
greatly interpolated by the heretical Jews who had received it. See Jones, l. c.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#34"></A>34.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> The passage differs here from the citation above, in the
omission of [Syriac], <i>these things; </i>which might have been omitted as
unnecessary to the argument.

</p>
<p><A NAME="#67"></A>67.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Our author might have added much, if he had chosen to do so,
from the Prophets, confirmatory of this position. I will supply an instance or
two. In Isaiah xxiv. 1. we are told that &quot; <i>the. Lord maketh the earth </i>(read,
<i>the land, </i>i.e. of Judea) <i>empty, and maketh it waste...and scattereth
abroad the inhabitants thereof.&quot; </i>3. &quot; <i>The land shall be utterly
emptied, and utterly spoiled.&quot;...5 because they have transgressed the
laws,... broken the everlasting covenant.&quot; </i>6. &quot;<i>Therefore hath
the curse devoured the earth (the land).. .therefore the inhabitants of the
earth (land) are burned </i>(comp. Deut. xxxii. 22--27) . . . 20. &quot;<i>And
it shall fall, and </i>NOT RISE AGAIN.&quot; Verse 23. identifies this
prediction with those here cited by Eusebius, viz. Matt. xxiv. and Luke xxi. The
conversion of the Gentiles is, moreover, beautifully touched upon ib. ver.
13-16. Comp. ch. xxv. 1. seq. In ch. xxvi. the same subject is taken up, and in
ver. 5, 6, we have literally described, the TRAMPLING DOWN <i>of this impious
city. </i>See also xxvi. ver. 10, 11, and xxviii. 18, also xxix. 1--7: 9--20,
which are all obvious and direct predictions of these times: and to these many
similar ones might be added. Let those who hold a restoration of the Jews look
to this. See also Ezek. v, vi, vii, throughout with the parallel places, as
given in the margins of the common Bibles. A large number of passages to this
effect are cited from Isaiah, by our author, Demonstr. Evang. Lib. ii.

restoration of the Jews to satisfy this ! See Demonstr. Evang. Lib. vii. p. 321.

Daniel's fourth monarchy, in which it is foretold they should have the rule.
After this, during the fifth kingdom the saints are to have the rule, these
therefore, must be <i>their </i>times, not, scripturally speaking, <i>&quot;the

in the times of Anicetus the eleventh Bishop of Rome. He enlarged upon the
errors of Cerdon his immediate predecessor, who had espoused and laboured to
propagate the opinions of Simon Magus. Marcion was an open blasphemer of God,
and corrupter of the Scriptures. He was one of those <i>who forbade marriage, </i>and
urged the <i>abstaining from certain meats, </i>and in this, he seems to have
agreed with the Manicheans and Saturninians: in many things with the Simonians,
Basilidians, Bogomilians, Audeans, &amp;c. This heresy had, in the times of
Epiphanius, extended itself to Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Syria, Cyprus,
and Persia. See Grabe's Irenaeus, p. 104, with the notes and references.

<p><A NAME="#111"></A>111.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Syr. [Syriac]. So called after their leader Valentinus, who came
to Rome in the times of Hyginus, and lived during those of Pius, and to those of
Anicetus. His doctrines had originated in Simon Magus, which he very gradually
and cautiously endeavoured to introduce into the Church. For which he was
eventually deprived of communion. See Euseb. Hist. Eccl. Index. It. Grabe.
</p>

was forbidden, </i>and <i>the abstaining from certain meats was urged. </i>See
Grabe's Irenaeus, p. 96, with the notes and I ndex.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#113"></A>113.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> He was a native of Mesopotamia, and flourished in the times of
M. Aurelius and L. Verus. He first attached himself to Valentinus<i>; </i>but
afterwards wrote against him and his doctrines. He is said to have been a very
elegant and acute writer: but he never purged himself, as it should seem, from
the Gnostic heresy. See Euseb. Eccl. Hist. Lib. iv. cap. xxx. Asseman. Bible.

<p><A NAME="#114"></A>114.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Manes, (or, as the modern Persians name him, [Persian], <i>Mani,
</i>the Syrians [Syriac] <i>Manni</i>,)<i> </i>was a Persian by birth, and, according
to the Chronicon of Edessa (Asseman. Bibl. Orient. Tom. i. p. 393, note) was
born A. D. 240. He entered Mesopotamia in A. D. 261, when he came to Archelaus
Bishop of the Caschari, for the purpose of disputing on the subject of religion:
but, being overcome, he secretly withdrew himself to Persia. He was there taken
by the king, flayed alive, and exposed to dogs. He was strenuous in advancing
the old oriental doctrine of the <i>two Principles, good, </i>and <i>bad, </i>among
Christians; of which marked traces remain to this day among the Mohammedans of
Persia, as may be seen in the celebrated work of Kuleini, under the figures of <i>Intellect </i>and <i>Folly,
</i>(see my Persian Controversies, p. 175, and note,) as also in the <i>Dabistan,
</i>ascribed to Mohsin Fani. He held with the Gnostics, that Christ was a mere
Phantom; he put it forth that himself was the Christ, and the Comforter
(Paraclete): and his twelve Disciples accordingly proscribed marriage as being
of the Devil, &amp;c. See Theodoret, Haeret. Fab. i. xxvi. Tom. iv. with the
Index. Epiphan. de Mens. et Pond. as cited by Asseman. A Syriac translation of
the work of Titus, Bishop of Bozra, against this heresy, is to be found in the
volume from which I take this work of Eusebius. All these, according to
Hegesippus, as preserved by Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. Lib. iv. cap. xxii.)
originated from Thebuthis, who, being mortified because not made a Bishop, set
about secretly to corrupt the Church. He was of one of the seven sects then
spread abroad among the Jews. Out of which also arose Simon, whence the
Simonians: also Cleobius, Dositheus, Gortheus, Masbotheus; whence also Menander,
Marcion, Carpocrates, Valentinus, Basilides, &amp;c. &amp;c. Hence also the
false Christs, false Apostles, false Prophets, &amp;c. See the notes of

among both the Jews and heathens, than the accusation of Magic against the
miraculous powers of Christ, and of His immediate followers. (See Wetstein on
Matt. xii. 24.) &quot;The Heathen,&quot; says Bingham,...&quot;because our
Saviour and his followers did many miracles, which they imputed to evil arts,
and the power of magic,....therefore generally declaimed against them as
magicians, and under that character exposed them to the fury of the
vulgar,&quot; &amp;c. From the prevalence of a belief in magic still in the
East, the Mohammedans strongly object to the manner in which we speak of
miracles; because, say they, it might still follow, that such miracles proceeded
from skill in magic. See my Persian Controversies, Camb. 1824, sect. ii. p. 191.

long with the ignorance of His disciples, seeing as they did His divine power,

foretold this, its coming to pass-- a thing most unnatural and unheard of, --
was sufficient to shew His foreknowledge. In his Ecclesiastical History (Lib.
vi. cap. viii.) he has mentioned this, as the daring act of an inexperienced
young man, resulting from a simple and juvenile method of interpreting the
passage referred to : which he says was, nevertheless, a proof of continence and
of a strong faith ; and this is perhaps, a main part of his object here. See

this passage to Christ, just as Eusebius does here; and, it must be confessed,
the matter contained in the 13th verse, powerfully supports this view. The
exegetical sense however, comes to the same under either view: for, whether we
take the <i>word of Christ, </i>with the moderns; or, the <i>Word, Christ, </i>with
the ancients, the effects, here spoken of, must all be eventually referred to
Him. I prefer the former view, as being the more obvious and simple.

<p><A NAME="#140"></A>140.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> He was, according to some, as ancient as the times of
Sennacherib ; which appears to be quite visionary. Jerome places him before the
times of our Lord, and makes him the author of the sect of the Pharisees. Origen
however affirms, that he was contemporary with the Apostles, and that he
declared himself to be the Christ. This, Origen probably grounded on a passage
in the Recognitions ascribed to Clemens Romanus, which informs us, that upon the
death of John the Baptist Dositheus set up his claim ; appointed thirty
disciples, and took a woman whom he named <i>the moon -- </i>(considering the
Sun probably as his own representative). To this man Simon Magus attached
himself, and obtained a place among the thirty, on the first vacancy that
afterwards occurred ; and soon after he fell in love with this woman. Hegesippus
too, makes Dositheus contemporary with the Apostles, as also does Eulogius,
Patriarch of Alexandria. See the note of Valesius to the Eccl. Hist. Lib. iv.

Ardaba, situate on the borders of Phrygia. He took to him two women, named
Priscilla and Maximilla; gave out that he was the Paraclete, and that his women
were Prophetesses. His sect, which was the Cataphrygian, was large, and, at one
time, reckoned Tertullian among its supporters. Among other things, the
dissolution of marriages and new sorts of fastings were inculcated as necessary.

<p><A NAME="#144"></A>144.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> As these citations were probably all made from memory, the
reader must not be surprised in finding that they occasionally differ, even in
the same context.--These passages would, one would think, be sufficient to
satisfy those who are so intent on the personal reign of Christ on earth, that
their notions are perfectly groundless. For, if He is not to be seen either <i>here,
there; </i>either, in <i>the desert, </i>or in the <i>secret chamber, </i>as the
false Christs were; but, whose coming was rather to be as the lightning in
rapidity and effect,--as indeed was the case in the overthrow of the Jews, the
spread of Christianity, and the fall of the Roman Empire; and as particularly
foretold in Dan. vii. 13,14: comp. Matt. xxiv. 24, 30; xxvi. 64. Ephes. i. 22.
Col. i. 23, also Zech. ix. 14, with the preceding context from ver. 9;--then
must all speculations about a personal reign on earth be visionary and false. Our author however, seems to
understand this, as referring to our Lord's coming to judgment at the last day.
If so, I have no doubt he is wrong.&nbsp;

<p><A NAME="#146"></A>146.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Cited by Origen (contra Cels. Lib. ii. p. 68.), with this
remark: [Greek] &quot;Quis item non mirabitur, ascendens contemplatione ad illud
vaticinium.....cum vidcat juxta illam pradictionem jam praedicatum in omnibus,
quae sub coelo sunt, terris Graecorum barbarorumque tum sapientibus, tum
insipientibus ?<i> </i>Omnem enim humanam naturam vicit sermo praedicatus cum
potentia, nec est videre ullum genus hominum, a quo haec doctrina recepta non
sit.&quot;
</p>
<p><A NAME="#147"></A>147.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> This argument is urged by Origen (contra Cels. Lib. ii. p. 68.
Edit. Spencer). From this reasoning of Eusebius, it is evident that he believed
that <i>the End </i>had come. And in this there can be no doubt, I think, he was
right; but as this involves a question very ill understood at this day, it may
be right to offer a few words here, as to what is meant by the <i>End. </i>This,
I think, Daniel (ix. 27.) terms the &quot;<i>consummation:&quot; </i>(comp. ver.
26 and vii. 26, 28,) that is, the <i>End </i>of his seventy weeks, (ib. ver. 24.
seq.) when <i>&quot;vision and prophecy&quot; </i>should be sealed: i.e.
completed. In chap. viii. 19, it is said, &quot;at the time appointed the <i>End
</i>shall be.&quot; Again, ib. chap. 27, 28. The <i>End </i>of the matter is
said to be, when the kingdom under the whole heaven shall have been given to the
Saints (i.e.) the Christians: in other words, when the Kings of the earth shall
have become its nursing fathers, and Queens its nursing mothers, (Is. xlix. 23.)
Again, Dan. xii. 7. When the power of the holy people shall have been scattered,
<i>&quot;all these things shall be finished:&quot; </i>i.e. when the power of
the new Church shall be spread abroad far and wide, then shall the <i>End </i>of
all these thimgs be. (Comp. Is. lxii. 12, &amp;c. Dan. viii. 24.) In Rev. x. 6,
7, which is an exact parallel of Dan. xii. 7, it is sworn by the angel, that <i>time
shall be no longer, </i>and that the mystery of God, as declared <i>by the
Prophets, shall be finished. </i>Now, our Lord has identified his predictions
(Matt. xxiv. and Luke xxi.) with these of Daniel. In the former (ver. 14.) He
says: &quot; <i>then shall the </i>END <i>come. When ye therefore shall see the
abomination... spoken of by Daniel the prophet&quot; </i>(ix. 27; xii.
11.)...&quot; <i>then shall be great tribulation&quot; </i>(ver. 21. comp. Dan.
ix. 26; xii. 1.) '<i>, </i>ver. 34, &quot;<i>This generation shall not pass
till all these things be</i>,&quot; i. e. commenced (comp. ver. 8.). In the
latter (Luke xxi. ver. 22.) &quot; <i>These be the days of vengeance, that </i>ALL
THINGS <i>which are written </i>MAY BE FULFILLED&quot; (i. e. in them). That the
terms, <i>latter days, last days, end of the world, ends of the world, </i>the <i>fulness
of time, </i>refer to the times of the Apostles, and those immediately
subsequent to these, the Concordance, with the parallels marked in our common
Bibles, will be sufficient to shew.--But the kingdom of the saints is never to
end (i. e. as far as pre-diction is concerned); it can therefore, have no <i>last
days, latter days, </i>or the like. When any such terms are referred to the last
judgment, the language is doctrinal, not prophetical. I conclude, therefore,
that this <i>End </i>did come, when the persecution of Diocletian ceased: for then all the conditions of prophecy had been fulfilled. Eusebius is therefore
right. See also my Sermons and Dissertations, London, 1831, and the Introduction
