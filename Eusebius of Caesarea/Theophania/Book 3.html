</P>
<p><b>1.</b> BECAUSE <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> then, human life had
undergone a change, through the things already mentioned, to a state henceforth
of peace and rest, and had been prepared to receive the perfect doctrine
relating to God; well again, did the common Saviour of all, the only (begotten)
WORD OF GOD, the King of all, shew forth the divine revelation of Himself by
very deeds, and at the time which was suitable. For, immediately and at once,
when He appeared in the world, those things which appertained to the ancient
service of Demons, were undone by the overthrow as it were, of (some ruinous)
war-engine; tidings announcing good things were preached to all nations, and God
who is over all, the Propitiator of the children of men, was announced. The
whole error of a plurality of Gods was also overthrown, and all the operations
of demons were forthwith cast aside. Men again were no more sacrificed ; nor
were the slaughterings of human beings, which from former times had ruined the
world, (persevered in). Nor again, were there multitudes of Rulers, Princes,
Tyrants, and Governours of <A HREF="#156"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|156</SPAN></A> the
people. Nor again, existed those things, on account of which wars, and the
reduction of cities, had been set on foot in every city and place: on the
contrary, one God was preached to all men : the one empire too of the Romans had
extended itself over all : and the peaceless and uncompromising enmity, which
had so long been the portion of the nations, came to an entire end. And, as the
knowledge of the one God, and of one just and righteous conduct resulting
therefrom, was, by the teaching of our Saviour, delivered to all men; so also
one king, at one and the same time, was established over the whole Roman empire,
and a profound peace prevailed in every thing. At once too, and at one period,
as it were at the intimation of the one God, two singular advantages sprung up
among mankind ; the Instruction that was in righteousness, and the Empire of the
Romans. For formerly, this error of the Demons had grievously enslaved the
nations: and, as the whole had been divided into many (parts), some taking Syria
by way of portion; others bearing rule in Asia; others, in Macedonia; others
cutting up and seizing upon Egypt; others, in like manner, upon the country of
Arabia: the race of the Jews again, had possession of Palestine<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.
And, in every village, city, and place, they were, as from madness (and) like
marauders and demoniacs in reality, careful (only) about warfare and contention
one against another;--of which enough has already been said.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> But (now), two great Powers sprung fully up, as (it were) out of
one stream; and they gave peace to all, and brought all together to a state of
friendship : (namely) the Roman Empire, which, from that time, appeared (as) one
kingdom ; and, the Power of the Saviour of all, whose <A HREF="#157"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|157</SPAN></A>
aid was at once extended to, and established with, every one. For, the divine
superiority of our Saviour swept away the authority of the many Demons, and many
Gods; so that the one kingdom of God was preached to all men Greeks and
Barbarians, and to those who (resided) in the extremities of the earth. The
Roman Empire too,-- since those had been previously uprooted who had been the
cause of the rule of many--soon subjugated all (others), and quickly brought
together into one state of accordance and agreement, the whole race of (man).
And, behold ! it henceforth brought together such a multitude of nations, as
soon to take possession (of all), even to the extremities of the earth; the
teaching<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> of our Saviour having, by the divine
power, already prepared all parties, and established (all) in a state of
equanimity. And this is indeed a great miracle to those, who set their minds on
the love of truth, and are unwilling to be envious against that which is good.
For at once, was the error of evil Demons put out of sight; and, at the same
time, did the enmity and contention of the nations, which had always existed,
lose its power: and again, at the same time, was the one God and the one
knowledge of Him, preached to all men through the teaching of our Saviour: at
the same time too, was the empire of the Romans<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
established among men; and, at once, was the (state or) the whole race of man
changed to (that) of peace; and all, professing a common brotherhood, betook
themselves to the instructing of their own nature. Forthwith too, they became
born, as it were, of one (common) Father, and as the children of the one God ;
of one Mother too, righteousness and truth; and so received they one another
with the salutation of peace, that henceforward the whole creation was nothing
less than as one household, and as a race governed by one law. It was (now)
practicable too, that any desiring to send, for the purposes of merchandise, and
to proceed, whithersoever he pleased, to do this with the greatest facility.
Those of the West could come without <A HREF="#158"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|158</SPAN></A>
danger to the East: and again, those who were here (in the East) could proceed
thither as to the house of their own fathers, according to the words of ancient
prophecy, and of many other burdens of the Prophets, which we have not now
leisure to mention, excepting these respecting our Saviour, the WORD OF GOD,
which proclaimed thus: &quot; <i>He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and
from the rivers to the extremities of the earth</i><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>:&quot;
and again, <i>&quot;In his days shall righteousness spring forth, and abundance
of peace</i><A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A><i> </i>:&quot; and again. &quot; <i>They
shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into reaping hooks</i><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><i>,
and nation shall not lift up the sword against nation; nor shall they learn war</i><A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><i>.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>3. </b>These things were foretold in the language of the Hebrews, (and)
have been published a very long time ago: they are now in our times witnessed in
their operation, confirming the testimonies of those ancient declarations<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>.
If then, thou desire other proofs of the excellency of the truth, (shewing) that
it is not of mortal nature, but is the word of God in truth; and (that) the <i>&quot;power
of God</i>,&quot;<i> </i>the Saviour, has been revealed in the world, not by
words (only), but by deeds; accept thou of them. <A HREF="#159"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|159</SPAN></A>
Open the eyes of thy understanding, unbar the doors of thy mind; and let thy
soul be wholly collected within thee. Consider and ask thyself, as if thou wert
interrogated by another, and thus investigate the nature of the things (to be
brought before thee).</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Who, of those that ever existed, is the mortal man, King,
Philosopher, Lawgiver, or Prophet, whether Greek or Barbarian, who bore all this
pre-eminence,--not after his death, but while he was still alive, and drew
breath;-- and could effect so<i> </i>much, that he should be preached throughout
the whole earth ? and, that his name should fill the hearing, and tongues of
every people upon the face of the whole earth ? But this, no man has done
excepting our Saviour alone, who said to his disciples by word, and fulfilled it
by deed: &quot; Go <i>and teach all nations</i><A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>.&quot;<i>
</i>He said (also) to them,--what He had foretold and previously revealed,--that
<i>it was necessary His Gospel should be preached throughout the whole creation,
for a testimony to all nations</i><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A><i>. </i>And,
with the word, He brought the deed also to pass: for, immediately,--and not at a
great distance of time,--the whole creation was filled with His words !</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Now. What can he have to say on this matter, who dares to oppose
the truth; since the testimony which is by means of the sight, is better than
that which is by any sort of words? But, if thou give up this first (sort of
proof), betake (thyself) to the latter: and now consider with thyself,--</p>
<p><b>6.</b> What mortal nature has ever appeared, which appointed like Him, by
word only and not in writing, laws that were just and pure, and sent these same
forth by the hands of His disciples, from one extremity of the creation to
another? and, Who so opened out His doctrines throughout the whole earth, that
immediately and day by day, the instructions which it was becoming should be
delivered by Him, were sufficiently preached in the hearing of all men,
Barbarians at once, and Greeks? But, if thou seek, thou shalt find no other: for
this is a work, resulting from the power of the Saviour of us all, alone.--Nor
will this <A HREF="#160"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|160</SPAN></A> persuade him who is not
to be persuaded. Let the same then say to us, for we are willing to learn--</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Who, of those who have been praised for the wisdom of their
observances, has ever so delivered the barbarous and brutal of barbarous
nations, by his merciful laws, that those who became (His) disciples among the
Scythians, feast (now) no more on human beings? nor, among the Persians, take
their own mothers (as wives) ? others too cast not their dead to the dogs? nor
do others deliver up those that are aged for strangulation ? nor are other
brutal and beastly things allied to these, done with others<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>?
But these are only small proofs of the revelation of the Godhead of the Saviour
of us all. Look now also at others, and consider with thyself:--</p>
<p><b>8.</b> What mortal man, of all the Princes at once, and Kings, and Armies,
and Companies, and Inhabitants, and Nations, ever existed during all these
periods, who added this also (to his exploits), that even those who were thought
to be Gods by the many, should wage war with Him,--and who at all times did wage
war with Him;--but, that He shewed his pre-eminence so far to exceed that of
man, that day after day there was exultation, and (that) His doctrine took
effect throughout the whole world ?</p>
<p><b>9.</b> And, Who is that other (person) who, since the life of man was set
up, ever sought to constitute a people after his own name;--a thing never yet
heard of:--and this, not in a corner, or obscurely in some part of the earth,
but in the whole earth under the sun; (and) did so settle by the power of the
rule of his Godhead, and so complete his wish, that he delivered the knowledge
of the one God who is beyond the heavens, the King of the whole world, together
with his fear, to all men on the face of the whole earth, to the nations both
Barbarian and Greek ?</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Who ever set about to teach, and, after he had so engaged himself,
brought, as in this marked instance, the matter to its right effect ? and
forthwith, through his <A HREF="#161"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|161</SPAN></A> own
efforts, so made known his undertaking, that by the love of God, he closed
rather the mouths than the doors of all; and proclaimed God who is over all ? He
commanded moreover, that all nations should truly acknowledge Him alone ? And,
because he willed that which was acceptable to God, He deigned to give His aid
and assistance to him, who was his own ambassador ? The doctrines therefore,
accompanying this preaching, were delivered; they were also received into the
hearing of all men, and they were by deeds confirmed!--How they were, see thou,
and consider;--</p>
<p><b>11.</b> What other person ever arose (as the sun) with his rational light
to the souls of men, and so prepared them to laugh at the error of the Demons of
their forefathers, that they no more attached the divine name to wood, stone,
and matter that is inanimate ?</p>
<p><b>12.</b> What other, excepting our Saviour, persuaded the Egyptians,--more
attached as they were to the fear of Demons than any other people, and from whom
came the error of a multiplicity of Gods to the Greeks,--that henceforth they
should be no more (so) infatuated, and no more give that venerable name to
beasts, reptiles, noxious and irrational animals; but should acknowledge that
one God alone who is above all, and contend for his righteousness in every sort
of death ?</p>
<p><b>13.</b> And Who invisibly, and by the powerful means and force of his
doctrine which was every where preached, drove out as evil beasts, from among
his own human flock, that injurious and destructive family of Demons, which from
ancient time had ruled the whole race of man; and, by means of the exciting
power of Idols, had put forth innumerable errors among them, so that these
Demons should no more give out their divinations at the springs and fountains ?
Nor again, should any earthly spirits, leading the world astray, implicate
mankind in error ? The fountain therefore, that was in Castalia became silent,
as <A HREF="#162"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|162</SPAN></A> did the other which was in
Colophon<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>: other fountains of divinations also
became silent; the Pythian, the Clarian, the Nemean; that in Delphos, and
Miletus; that in Colophon, and in Lebadia, of which (last) so much was boasted
from ancient times. To the doctrine of Christ did they all accede. Where are
(now) Amphilocus and Mopsus? There is not a man in (either) place! Where are
Amphiaraus and Aesculapius<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>? Where is that (Image)
of Ammon, and (which was) in the Desert of Lybia ? All these Gods have crept
under the earth, being alarmed at the name of our Saviour<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>!
not unlike those their Princes who could not, when He went about among men, bear
the rays of his Godhead<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>, but grievously
complained, crying <A HREF="#163"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|163</SPAN></A> out, &quot; <i>What
have we to do with thee, Jesus </i>&quot; (thou) &quot; <i>Son of God,&quot; </i>and
saying, &quot; <i>Art thou come before the time to torment me? We know thee who
thou art, that thou art the Holy One of God</i><A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A><i>.&quot;
</i>The Egyptian Demons therefore, when hearing that the doctrine of our Saviour
was preached in the whole of their land, confessed that they themselves were
nothing ! They gave up accordingly the places subject to their customs to be
destroyed, together with (their) Fanes and Images, and betook themselves to
flight<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> and departure; driven away as they were by
the Divine power. The divinations too of every place were destroyed ; and the
Christ of God alone, and the one only God who was preached by him to all men,
became the object of divine worship.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> What other (person) moreover, has, like this our Saviour, given
such power to those who have, in purity and sincerity, arrived at the life of
excellence and of wisdom which has been delivered by Him, that they should by
calling on Him, and by means of pure prayers offered up through Him to Almighty
God, cast out that superabundance of evil Demons from the human body ?</p>
<p><b>15.</b> What other too, except Him alone, has granted to those who draw
near to Him. that they should perform the rational and unbloody services which
are (offered) by means of prayer, and the secret (use of) the Divine <A HREF="#164"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|164</SPAN></A>
announcements ? and, on which account He has appointed, throughout the whole
creation of man, altars without fire, services worthy of God, the setting apart
of Churches, and, that intellectual and rational sacrifices should, by means of
rites becoming the Deity, be put forth to that one God alone, who is the King of
all nations ?</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Who moreover, tacitly, and by means of His invisible power, has
abolished those sacrifices which were completed with blood, impurity, smoke, and
fire ? -- those abominable shrines also for the slaughter of men ; and so
provided, that human sacrifices should no more be offered, and these things be
no more done ? -- that the writings of the Greeks also should attest, that it
was not from ancient times, but (only) after the divine teaching of our Saviour,
in the times of Hadrian<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>, that human sacrifices
ceased throughout the whole earth ?</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Since then, all these are clear proofs confirming the divine power
of the Saviour of us all, Who is he whose soul (partakes) so much of iron, as
not to give his testimony to the truth ? and to confess His divine and living
(active) power ? For it is of the living, and not of the dead, that these deeds
are. For the visual perception of something distant is, they say, (the effect)
of some thing (really) visible. <A HREF="#165"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|165</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>18.</b> The Race therefore which contended with God, disturbed the life of
man, and introduced, led on, and could effect much, has suddenly, lately, and
but a short time ago--because driven out from among men,--been cast to the
earth, as an object deserving of the utmost contempt, breathless, motionless,
speechless, and again, bereft both of utterance and of remembrance !</p>
<p><b>19.</b> This mortal nature therefore, and again that which has no proper
existence, is (as) nothing. And that which is<i> </i>(as) nothing, is likewise
inoperative. But, (as to) Him who acts at all times, and is every moment
operative, and is more potent than any living creature, How can He be supposed
to have no proper existence, although not visible to the bodily eyes? But,
discrimination is not by the senses; nor do we try the terms of art, the
perception of doctrines, nor yet the mind of man, by the bodily senses: much
less can man ever see with the eyes the person, or the power, of God.
Nevertheless, these things may be known from the effects of their (several)
operations. On this account, it is our duty to inform ourselves respecting the
unseen power of the Saviour of us all, to prove His works, and to distinguish,
whether we ought to confess that the things which have hitherto been done by
Him, are of one living; or, whether we are to affirm, that they are of some one,
who had no proper existence; or, whether this same thing be foolish, and the
question respecting it inconsistent. For, he who has no proper existence<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
in all his parts, has, it is<i> </i>clear, no proper existence at all, and is
unable either to act, or to effect any thing. Such is the nature which is dead ;
while that opposed to it is living.-- But, it is now time we should investigate
those works of our Saviour which appertain to our days, and to take a <A HREF="#166"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|166</SPAN></A>
view of the living (effective) works of the living God. For the living works of
God are life indeed. Learn (then), what those things are about which thou
enquirest, and Him (at the same time), who lives in His works.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> Some<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> of the contenders with God
did, but a little while ago, rebelliously, forcibly, and with a mighty hand, so
rase to the foundation and overthrow His houses of prayer, that the churches
disappeared: by every means too, they made war with Him who is invisible to the
eyes, attacking and reproaching (Him) with innumerable injurious expressions.
But He, while unseen, secretly avenged Himself of them. And they again (felt
this), not by one intimation from God (only). They (I say) who, but a short time
before, were delighting themselves and happy;-- they who were worshipped by all
men, as if they had been Gods, and who, during the revolutions of many years,
gloriously administered the affairs of their rule: for before they made war with
Him, they had the most perfect peace and friendship (with all) ; but when they
became changed, and dared to contend with God, and arranged their Deities before
them in battle array against Him who is our (God), in order that (these) might
be their strength;-- (then), forthwith--in one moment--and at the intimation of
God, and through the power of Him with whom they had contended, did all they who
had been thus daring, suffer punishment, so that they gave in to Him on whom
they had made war, turned their backs (in flight), and confessed His Godhead !
They allowed also, and persuaded, that (men) should boldly do the reverse of
those things which were from ancient time. He therefore quickly <A HREF="#167"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|167</SPAN></A>
established throughout the whole earth the signal mark of victory, and adorned
(it), as from the first, with Temples which were pure, and distinguished (set
apart) as for the prayers of the whole creation; so that He consecrated holy and
dedicated places, in every village, city, place, and even in the deserts of the
Barbarians, to the One God (and) King of all; -- to Him who is the Lord of all<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>;--
that He might hence dignify the things (so) set apart, with the name of Him who
was their Lord. Nor was it of man, that (this) happy appellation fell to their
lot; but it was of Him who is Lord of all, that hence they were each dignified
with the name of &quot;the House of the Lord<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>.&quot;
Let any one who wishes then, stand forth in the midst and learn, who it was
that, after all this subversion and destruction, raised up on high from the
earth, buildings such as these throughout the whole creation; and who it was,
that vouchsafed to afford to these things, of which every hope had been cut off,
a renovation far better than they formerly had! Nor was the great miracle of THE
WORD, which renewed these, delayed until after the death of those who contended
with God, but (took place) during their stay in the world. Those very persons (I
say) who rased (the churches), did by their words and writings preach the new
birth, which directly opposed their own (former) darings : and this they did,
not <A HREF="#168"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|168</SPAN></A> when enjoying rest, so that
any one should imagine that it was of the friendship of men; but when driven
forth by the stroke of God.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> He then, even after all these storms of persecution, did, by means
of sharp calamities and His divine teaching, so enlighten and set up throughout
the whole creation, men zealous of the life of wisdom, multitudes both of men
and of ministering women, and of congregations of virgins, that they (all) were
(thus) established throughout the whole of their lives in perfect holiness.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> Who moreover persuaded women, multitudes of children, and of men,
voluntarily to suffer the privation of food and of wine for many days ? to sleep
on the earth ? to have recourse to a hard and robust discipline, coupled with
chastity ? and made them exchange the food of the body, for those spiritual and
rational provisions of the soul,--the one for the other,--which are obtained by
the divine reading ?</p>
<p><b>23.</b> And, Who taught men, barbarian and rustic, as well as women,
children, and innumerable multitudes of heathen slaves, to despise death ? to be
persuaded that their souls were immortal ? that the eye of justice was open,
viewing the deeds of all men, just and unjust ? and to hope for the judgment of
God ?--That it was, on account of these things, their duty to be careful as to
the life of righteousness and temperance ? And, that if they were <A HREF="#169"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|169</SPAN></A>
not so, they could not otherwise be brought under that yoke of righteousness,
which hitherto had been brought into operation by Him alone whom we call God ?</p>
<p><b>24.</b> But, let us dismiss these things, and let us otherwise approach
him whose mind is (as) the rock; and let us interrogate him thus, with the
questions (growing) out of these things (following):--O bring thou forth the
word of reason, not from a heart implicated in error<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>,
but advancing (this) as the fruit of the intelligent and rational soul; and,
having meditated much, say between thyself and thy soul,--</p>
<p><b>25. </b>What other, of those preached of from ancient times, ever did like
Him who is called God by us, become known, established, and declared, by the
enouncements from above of the Prophets many ages ago, among those ancient
friends of God, the Hebrew family ?--those (I say), who also previously
delivered in writing, in the divine scriptures, the place of His manifestation,
the time of His advent, the manner of His life, His power, His words, and His
deeds?</p>
<p><b>26.</b> Or, Who so suddenly appeared as an executor of vengeance against
those who dared to oppose Him, that, upon the Jews acting (thus) impiously, He
forthwith dealt out punishment by means of His unseen power on their whole
nation ? and overthrew to the foundations, both their place and rule ?--For He
at once levelled to the ground, both their Temple, and their sacred (things) !</p>
<p><b>27.</b> And Who, like this our Saviour, has clearly foretold the things
that respected the impious (Jews), and respecting the Church which was
established by Himself throughout the whole creation, and in the very things
themselves? and has shewn their confirmation in their effects?--who said of the
impious (Jews), &quot;<i>Behold, your house is left desolate</i><A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A><i>;
nor shall stone remain upon</i> <A HREF="#170"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|170</SPAN></A> <i>stone
in this place, which shall not be thrown down</i><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A><i>.&quot;
</i>And of His Church He said; &quot; <i>Upon this rock I build my Church, and
the gate-bars of Hell shall not prevail against it<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
</i>?&quot;</p>
<p><b>28.</b> And this also, that He should change men poor and rustic, from the
occupation of fishing, to that of rule ? and, that He should make these into
Lawgivers, and Teachers, of the whole creation of man ? How is it to be imagined
by thee, that He then (so) made the promise by word, and brought it to pass in
deed, that He made them &quot;Fishers of men?&quot; He gave them moreover, all
this excellency and power, that they should compose and complete Books; and,
that they should give such confirmation to these, that they should be received
throughout the whole creation, in the languages of both the Greeks and
Barbarians ? and, that in all nations they should be taught, and believed, as
containing the written words of God<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>?</p>
<p><b>29.</b> And, How does it appear to thee, that He should foretel what was
about to take place ? and should previously testify to His Disciples, that,
because they should give their testimony to Him, <i>they should come before
Kings and Governours: and that they should be punished, and undergo grievous
torments</i><A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>?--</p>
<p><b>30.</b> And this also, that He should so prepare them, that they should
voluntarily suffer ? and, that they should <A HREF="#171"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|171</SPAN></A>
so firmly arm their souls with the armour of righteousness as with adamant, that
they should be seen (engaged) in conflict against those who opposed them ;--How
does not this surpass all description ?</p>
<p><b>31.</b> Nor was it only, that He impressed on the souls of those who
(immediately) followed Him such power, that when, having clone nothing worthy of
death, they willingly underwent every species of punishment and torment, for the
sake of the righteousness of that God who is overall; but also, on those who
received (it) from them; and so again, on those who came afterwards; and on
those even to this present, and (who live) in our own times;--How does this not
transcend every sort of miracle<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> ?</p>
<p><b>32.</b> Besides, Which of the kings ever remained prosperous in his rule,
throughout all this length of time ? And, Who is he, who so conquered after his
own death, and established the mark of victory over his enemies, that he subdued
every region, place, and city, both of the Greeks and Barbarians? and beat down,
by the hidden and invisible power of (his own) right hand, that which opposed
him ?</p>
<p><b>33.</b> But<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>, the chief of all the things
that have been mentioned, is that peace which was, by His power, supplied to the
whole earth; of which we have already said what was proper. And, What mouth of
the calumniator would not (the consideration) close, that love and concord so
ran together with His doctrine in (effective) operation, into all nations ? and,
that the peace which took place among the nations throughout all the world, and
the word, which was sown (as seed) by Him among all nations, had formerly been
so foretold by the Prophets of God ? But a (whole) day would be too short, were
I to attempt to collect and shew within it, the open proofs of the divine power
of the WORD OF GOD, the Saviour of all, which have been put forth up to this
time. So that there never was a man at any time, no not among the Greeks, who
has shewn forth such transcendent and divine power as He has, who has been
preached to every man, and is the Saviour of all, and the <A HREF="#172"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|172</SPAN></A>
only (begotten) WORD OF GOD who is above all. But, Why do I say &quot;of men
?&quot; when behold! no such nature as His has appeared upon earth, even of
those who have been named Gods by all nations? If (not so), let him who wishes
shew (this): let every existing Philosopher too come forward and tell us, What
God or Hero has at any period, or ever, been heard of, who delivered the
doctrine of eternal life, and of the kingdom of heaven, --a thing not of recent
occurrence,--to mankind, as this our Saviour (has done) ? who has caused
innumerable multitudes, throughout the whole creation, to be instructed in His
own doctrines of wisdom ? and has persuaded them to follow after the life which
is heavenly, and to despise that which is of time (only) ; and to hope for the
heavenly mansions, which are kept for the souls that love God?</p>
<p><b>34.</b> What <A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> God or Hero is it, that has
ever so fully arisen (like the sun) and given light from the East even to the
West by the bright rays of his doctrine, that, immediately and with the
swiftness as it were of the course of the Sun, all the nations of the earth
(thence) rendered to the one God, one and the same service?</p>
<p><b>35.</b> What<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> God or Hero is it, who ever
contended with all the gods and heroes both of the Greeks and Barbarians, and
laid down a law, that not one of them should be thought a God ? and, having so
legislated, persuaded (men of this) ? and who, when they all afterwards waged
war against Him, being one and the same, overthrew every power opposed to Him;
and shewed that He was superior to all, both gods and heroes, that ever existed,
so as to be called throughout the whole creation of man, and by all people, the
ONLY (begotten) WORD OF GOD ? <A HREF="#173"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|173</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>36.</b> What God or Hero was it, who ever delivered to all nations
dwelling on the great element of the whole earth,--to those on the land, and on
the sea<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>,--that they should make a feast in
holiness, both of the body and the soul, on the day of every week which is
called among the Greeks the Sun's day<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>? And, that
they should assemble themselves together, not that their bodies should hear--
but their souls--that it was by means of the divine teaching, they should live ?</p>
<p><b>37.</b> What<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> God or Hero was it who, when
they so made war with him, set up, as our (Saviour) has done, such a mark of
victory in opposition to his enemies ? For they ceased not to contend both with
His doctrine, and His people, from first to last: while He, being invisible,
secretly overthrew them, and advanced His own, together <A HREF="#174"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|174</SPAN></A>
with the houses of God, to great glory ! But, Why should we wish to circumscribe
by words, the divine powers of the Saviour of us all, which exceed all
description ? When behold ! should we remain silent, the things themselves would
cry out to those, whose souls have ears ?</p>
<p><b>38.</b> This<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> is strange indeed, and
something not to he imagined; at any period too, it must be a singular thing
(which) He brought to this world of mankind, and, that the only Son of God
should in truth, ever have appeared to those that are on the earth:--and that
the whole race of man should through Him, receive one who should in his own
(human) nature, so introduce him to the righteousness which is true, that
henceforth there should be set up throughout the whole creation of man, places
for instruction in the Divine enouncements and teaching ; and that men,
barbarous and fierce, should so change their minds to peacefulness, that the
rational disposition of their souls should receive of His virtue; and, by His
means, acknowledge their Father who is in heaven, with the Saviour of all, the
ONLY (begotten) <A HREF="#175"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|175</SPAN></A> WORD OF GOD, the
King of all; and that to Him, and through Him who is the Cause of every good
thing, they should <i>so </i>render the praises that are due, and the blessings
and thanksgivings which are right, that henceforth the righteous praises and
thanksgivings, which are suitable to the companies of the Angels that are in
heaven, should also be put up, day and night, by the inhabitants of this element
of earth !</p>
<p><b>39.</b> These acts, therefore,--pertaining to salvation, and advantageous
to the world, and to the Divine Manifestation of THE WORD OF GOD among men, as
well as innumerable others like them, on account of which he came into the world
of men<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>--He performed not in His usual manner,
that is, incorporeally; for, He had acted throughout the whole world secretly,
and, by these his works, shewed both to them who are in the heavens, and to them
who are on the earth, His innumerable operations. But recently, (he has done
this) in a manner foreign to His own custom. For He has, by means of a mortal
vessel,--not unlike the king, who (acts) through an Interpreter,--openly
declared His edicts and methods of government among men; in order that He might
evince His providential care for mortals, by that which was like to themselves,
(and) that they might find life. But, as it has been seen that not one, but many
were the causes, why the Saviour of all made His Divine manifestation among men;
it becomes necessary, that we should also say in a few words, in their order,
why He availed himself of this human vessel, and came for the purpose of ruling
among men. How then, could the Divine, concealed, invisible, and untangible,
Essence,--that unembodied and incorporeal mind, THE WORD OF GOD,--otherwise
exhibit himself to men immersed in the depths of evils, and the corporeal
substances (of nature), seeking God upon earth, but otherwise not finding Him;--or,
being unwilling to search after the Maker and Creator of the whole creation<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>,
--if not by means of (some) human compound, and in some form known to ourselves,
and, as it were by an <A HREF="#176"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|176</SPAN></A> Interpreter
? For otherwise, How could the eyes of the body look upon the incorporeal nature
of God ? And, How could mortal nature discover Him who is concealed, (and)
invisible, whom they knew not from the multitude of His works ? On, this account
therefore, He required a mortal vessel, a help which would comport with the
conversation (had) among men; because, this would be agreeable to them ; for
they say, &quot;Every thing loves its like <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>.&quot;
For, just as some great king might stand much in need of an Interpreter, who
could enounce his words to the inhabitants of both countries and cities, whose
understanding (of languages) was diverse; so also did THE WORD or GOD,--who was
about to be for the healing of souls,--that He should exhibit himself in a body,
and upon the earth. He would want a Mediator, not unlike an Interpreter, and a
bodily compound. And this would be some human instrument, by means of which He
could make known to men, what those concealed (properties) of the Godhead were.
Nor was it (this) alone, but also that He, the compassionate WORD OF GOD, should
exhibit Himself to those who delighted in the sense of things seen, and were
seeking God by means of inanimate Images, and carved Idols; and imagining,
through (mere) material bodies, that there was a God; but, from the infirmity
and deficiency of their minds were giving to men, mortal in their nature, the
name of Gods. On this account, He prepared for himself a Temple more holy than
all ; a bodily vessel, and sensible habitation, for the rational Power ; an
Image pure, and in every thing excellent, and more honourable than the whole of
inanimated images<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>. For that which was of
inanimate <A HREF="#177"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|177</SPAN></A> matter, and in the form
of an Image of brass, iron, gold, ivory, stone, or wood, was fabricated by the
hands of artificers of (mere) matter, altogether for the residence of Demons,
and to administer to the error of fools. But the Divine Image, variously adorned
by the wisdom of the Divine Power, partook of life and of the Essence which is
intelligent: the Image, filled with every excellence,--the Divine Image, the
habitation of THE WORD OF GOD, and the holy temple of the holy God,--was
prepared by the power of the Holy Ghost, in order that He, who resided therein,
might become known among mortal men by means of one who was their equal, as it
were by an Interpreter; but who should not fall after the manner of their
passions, nor be bound in the body, as the manner is with the soul of man : nor
yet, when appearing small (in reputation), should undergo any change on that
account as to his Godhead. For<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>, as the rays of
the sun's light suffer nothing from their filling every thing, nor when they
permeate the unclean bodies of mortals; so, in a far higher degree, the Power
which is incorporeal, THE WORD OF GOD, suffers nothing in its own Essence,
neither is it mutilated, nor is it ever diminished, when, incorporeal as it is,
it permeates that which is corporeal. In the same manner therefore, the Saviour
of all presented himself to every man (as) the helper and Saviour, by means of
the human vessel which He put forth, just as the musician<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
(does), who is willing to shew his skill by means of his lyre. History too among
the Greeks teaches (us), that Orpheus moved by his song every sort of animal,
and pacified their angry feelings by means of a hollow instrument, the strings
of which he struck. This is moreover sung in the assemblies of the Greeks; and
it is believed, that an inanimate lyre soothed both the animals and trees, and
so changed even the oaks that they became imitators of music. This (personage) <A HREF="#178"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|178</SPAN></A>
therefore, filled with all wisdom and all prudence, THE WORD OF GOD, put forth
every sort of healing for the souls of men which had been reduced to all kinds
of evil. He took into His hands the instrument of the musician, the work of His
own wisdom : this He struck with His hand, (producing) songs and sweet strains
to rational man, not to animals that are irrational; and healed<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>,
by the medicines of His heavenly teaching, every kind of the fierce, both of the
Greeks and Barbarians, as well as the rude and beastlike passions of the soul;
and did, as a skilful physician, shew by the aid<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
of one of their equals, and who was like to themselves,-- to the souls which
were implicated in disease, and seeking God among bodies and substances which
were elemental,--God in man ! Nor again, was He less careful as to the body,
than He was as to the soul. For He provided, that the things which He did by
means of the Body<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>, should be apparent to men's
bodily eyes; (that is) that they should see astonishing miracles, signs, and
(other) divine powers. And again, He preached to the hearing of the body, these
doctrines through a bodily tongue<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>. All these
things therefore, He delivered by means of the Body which he bore,--as it were
by an Interpreter,--to those who otherwise could not,--except only in this way,--be
made sensible of His Godhead. These<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A><sup> </sup>things
too, were (thus) administered by the will of His Father: He still remaining with
His Father, as He was before, immaterial, incorporeal, (and) unchanged as to His
(eternal) Essence. Nor did he suffer corruption from His <A HREF="#179"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|179</SPAN></A>
(former) nature; nor was He confined by the bonds of the body ; nor was He here,
only such as His human vessel was ; nor was He restrained from being in other
places of (this) whole: on the contrary, even then, when He conversed among men,
did He fill all things: was with His Father<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A> and
was in Him; and then also, He fully and providentially took care of all things,
whether in heaven, or on the earth. Nor was He ever, as we are, withholden from
being near to every thing; nor was He hindered from acting, after His own divine
manner. On the contrary, the things that were of Himself He gave to man; but,
those which were of man, He took not. Of His divine power too, He provided for
mortals; while from His participation with the mortal, He received nothing.
Neither<A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A> was He who was incorporeal, polluted when
born in the body. Nor again, did He who was impervious to passion, suffer in His
(eternal) Essence, even when mortal nature had been assigned to Him. For,
neither does he who strikes the lyre become in any thing subject to suffering,
although the instrument should be broken, or the strings be cut: in like manner
too, we do not say when punishment is inflicted on the person of a wise man,
that the wisdom of the wise man, or the soul which is in his body, is either cut
off, or consumed. So, much less is it right we should affirm, that the Power of
the Divine WORD can receive any thing like loss from the sufferings of the body.
Nor, does any thing forbid our affirming that,-- since, in our example, the rays<A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
of the Sun sent down from heaven to earth, permeated the clay, mire, and every
sort of impurity,--the light was therefore in no respect polluted, although
these things received light from its splendour. For the light did not (thus)
become clay, nor did the Sun become polluted, by its commixture with (such)
body; because these things are not foreign in their nature to bodies. <A HREF="#180"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|180</SPAN></A>
But<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A> He,--who is immaterial and incorporeal, THE
WORD OF GOD, who is both the life, and intelligent light,--impels, by the divine
power which is incorporeal, every thing He approaches, both to live and to
remain in this rational light. In like manner also, the body to which this is
near becomes sanctified; and quickly does He enlighten it: all diseases too,
pains and sufferings, pass away (from it) ; and that which was defective is
supplied from (His) fulness. On this account He gave up His whole life, at one
time exhibiting His image under sufferings like those common to ourselves; at
another, revealing himself, God THE WORD, in great and astonishing works and
acts, as God. And, when He foretold something by His prophetic words which
should come to pass, He likewise exhibited Him who was invisible to the many,
THE WORD OF GOD, by works, and by astonishing deeds; by signs, wonders, and
extraordinary powers (put forth) : and again, instructing the souls of men by
the divine doctrines, He prepared them to draw near to the heavenly city which
is above<A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>, and to hasten to those their
fellow-citizens there, as to their own brothers and equals : also, to know their
Father who is in heaven, and the excellency of their kind, which is of the
Essence that is intellectual and rational: teaching them also, that they should
no more err, but henceforth so live in all purity and holiness,--so (I say),
that they might make their departure hence to that place easy, and without
hindrance; and, that they should be prepared to receive forthwith, with the
companies of the holy Angels, everlasting life with God the King of all, and the
light which cannot be described, and the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p><b>40.</b> Thus therefore, the ONLY (begotten) WORD or GOD, who availed
Himself of a human instrument, and set up His own Interpreter, administered
every thing for the healing of men by the will of His Father; still remaining
immaterial and incorporeal, just as He formerly was, with His Father<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>.
By means of a man also. He shewed forth <A HREF="#181"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|181</SPAN></A>
God<i> </i>to man, through mighty acts and wonderful works. In the divine Power
and in true Wisdom, He scattered His doctrine (as seed); and taught these
things, with others allied to them. Nor became He inferior, from what He did:
nor, (as so) doing, became He the less dignified from what He taught and
delivered.--The doctrines of life and words of light, He laid not down in any
book of paper, nor in the perishing skins of animals; but He inscribed on the
very souls of His disciples, as upon intellectual tablets, the doctrines
respecting the kingdom of God. In the whole of His instructions on heavenly
things, hidden enouncements, and which had never before been heard, were
delivered. It was also by means of these things, that He taught that the souls
which were on the earth, were beloved of God; delivered the memorial of the life
that is with God the Father, in heaven; and also, stirred (men) up to cry in
prayer and to say, &quot;<i>Our Father who art in heaven</i>,&quot;<i> </i>and,
that they should be cognizant of their family which is above. If then, thou art
desirous of being a partaker in the contemplation of these things, there is no
feeling of jealousy hindering thy approach to the hearing of the Scriptures of
His Disciples, and to the knowing of His record in all its parts, both as to His
deeds and words ; so that thou mayest in truth, view God, and THE WORD OF GOD ;
and see, how He existed by means of an Interpreter with men, in the example of
(His) sufferings ; how He, who was immortal, conversed with mortals; how the
Image (of God), which is incorporeal, became vested with the nature which is
human: and, how the Image of God, which was in Him, moved (Him): how He sent
forth enouncements, and made public the Divine teaching; and (how) the Saviour
of all, healed every sort of disease and infirmity: and, how ready He was, in
whom there was no sin, to good works; and, how those things which eyes had <A HREF="#182"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|182</SPAN></A>
not seen, and which had not entered into the hearing of men, He delivered in
mighty deeds; and thus made His Disciples to approach the very summit of
excellency with God; made them wise through the power which cannot be described,
and constituted them true preachers of His Godhead. Thus again He healed those,
whose souls were corrupted by every sort of sin; at one time, inflicting the
sufferings (which were) helpful and right<A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>; at
another, delivering a view of the mystery and doctrine of His Godhead to those
who were able to receive it. And, What need is there we should say, how easily
and well, and with (what) just rebuke, He received those who were enemies to the
truth : at once healing and instructing even these, by the open enouncement of
His words ? and, how meekly he presented His person to all as a helper, and as
long suffering and passive ? as a Physician also, not of souls only, but also of
bodies ? On this account, the name of JESUS was previously imposed on our
Saviour<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>;--which is a Hebrew word, designating
JESUS as the Physician<A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A> of all. Now, the
(propriety of the) imposition of the name designating <i>healing </i>on Jesus,
He evinced by the works (which He did); for He instructed the souls of men by
the Heavenly doctrine, while he healed the Body of all sufferings, pains, and
infirmities, by the power of the healing WORD. At one time, He cleansed the
leprous in body<A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>: at another, He cast out by (His)
command the Demons that (possessed) men<A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>: and,
again at another, He freely healed those who had been reduced by disease ! At
one time also, to him-- whose body was debilitated, and all his limbs powerless,--
<A HREF="#183"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|183</SPAN></A> He said by word only, &quot;<i>Arise,
take up thy bed, and walk</i><A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>;&quot; and this
(man) did what He commanded ! And again at another time, He gave the perception
of light to the Blind<A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>! And thus again, at
another, a woman<A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>,--who had been afflicted with an
issue of blood, and had during the revolution of many years been reduced by her
complaint, seeing that great companies were round about Him, and not allowing
her to kneel and pray that she might be healed of her complaint,--thought, that
if she could but touch the border of His garment, (she should be healed) ; she
accordingly pressed in, and touched the border of his garment; and at once, she
was both healed of the evil, and immediately became healthy; bearing (away with
her) a mighty proof of the power of THE WORD OF GOD ! Another man<A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
also, the servant of a king,--because his child was grievously afflicted,--fell
down before Him, and He forthwith took and healed him ! There was another again,
the chief of a synagogue<A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A> of the Jews, whose
daughter (He restored) ; but this was after she was dead ! And, What need can
there be, that we should tell how another arose<A HREF="#65"><SUP>65</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>by the power of the Saviour of all, who had been dead four days, hearing
only the voice of the all life-giving WORD which called him ? Or, how He made
His paths upon the sea as upon dry land, causing His Vessel to traverse the back
of the waters<A HREF="#66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>? Or, how<A HREF="#67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>
when His Disciples were sailing and the storm was against them, He rebuked the
sea, the storm, and the winds;--gave the commandment by word; and they were
instantly silent, so that they were wrought upon, as by the voice of their Lord
? (How) He so filled<A HREF="#68"><SUP>68</SUP></A> and satisfied five thousand
men,--when there was with them a company of many women and children,--with five
loaves, that they took up an entire remainder which would suffice to fill twelve
baskets ! To Whom is not this astonishing ? and Does it (not) likewise challenge
the inquiry which relates to his unseen power ? <A HREF="#184"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|184</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>41.</b> Let any one therefore who will, take up the true faith, together
with the open proof of the revelation of our Saviour's Divinity, from many other
great miracles; and particularly from this,--if he will also consider,--that He
foreknew by the divine power what should come to pass, and openly foretold the
great change to His better (doctrine) which should take place among men
throughout the world; and also predicted, that He himself would be the doer of
this: and from these very deeds, let such place faith in (this) His promise.
Many other great and evident proofs of His Godhead moreover, (afforded) in many
things similar to these, will any one, carefully enquiring, find from His
predictions with their fulfilment: which we ourselves shall also examine in this
work at the proper time. But, that which we now have before our eyes,--that our
discourse may not lengthen itself greatly out, so as to detain thee upon all His
mighty works--is the death, which (His) Interpreter,--the clothing of THE WORD
OF GOD, and the Image that was openly revealed,--underwent, and which (event)
every one acknowledges.</p>
<p><b>42.</b> This His death therefore, which has been made public, was (so)
accompanied by the miracle, that it was unlike that of the rest of mankind. For
it was not, that He perished by disease, by strangulation, or by fire; or was,
even on the cross itself, cut off by the sword, as a mark of victory, in the
manner of others who are evil-doers; nor yet, did he suffer less than any one of
those whom they usually put to death; for He suffered a death of violence: but
He himself alone, by his own will, delivered up His Vessel to those (his)
accusers; and forthwith He raised Himself from the earth ;--</p>
<p><b>43.</b> For said (the Evangelist,) &quot;<i>He cried out greatly, and gave
up His Spirit to His Father</i><A HREF="#69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>: and (so)
effected a release from His soul, and made His departure from the body. On this
account, He had previously delivered this same His death to his disciples, when
teaching (them) and saying; &quot;<i>No man taketh my life from me;&quot; </i>and,
&quot;<i>I</i> <i>have power to lay it down:&quot; </i>and again, &quot;<i>I</i>
<i>have power</i> <A HREF="#185"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|185</SPAN></A> <i>to take it up</i><A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A><i>:
</i>and again, &quot;<i>I</i> <i>am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my
own know me; and I lay down my life for my sheep</i><A HREF="#71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>.&quot;<i>
</i>The cause of His death too, He establishes in a few words, when saying,
that, <i>&quot;Unless the grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it
remaineth alone ; but, if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit</i><A HREF="#72"><SUP>72</SUP></A>.&quot;</p>
<p><b>44.</b> Having then, delivered representations of this sort respecting His
own death, He effected the release from his soul, and made (His) departure from
the body. After this, His body was taken up by his acquaintances, and was
consigned to (its) due interment. Again on the third day, He resumed that
(being) from which He had before, by the exertion of His own will, departed. And
again, He shewed to his Disciples the selfsame person, both in body and
substance, just as it formerly was:-- to them (I say) with whom He conversed a
little, and with whom He remained a short time. He was then taken up whither He
was before : and, before their eyes, did He make his departure and ascension to
heaven, in order that they, to whom He had delivered (His) pledge as to deeds,
might be made the Teachers of the fear of God who is above, to all nations.</p>
<p><b>45.</b> Now<A HREF="#73"><SUP>73</SUP></A>, What can be wanting after
these things, except that we should state the cause of THIS, which was the chief
of all ? I (now) speak of the close of His life, which has been spoken of by
all; of the manner of His passion, and of the great miracle of His resurrection
after <A HREF="#186"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|186</SPAN></A> death. After viewing these
things then, let us now come again to our proofs; and let us confirm these same
by open testimonies. He availed Himself therefore, of a mortal Vessel,--for the
reasons already given,--as of an Image becoming the Deity; and this He both put
forth into life, and by means of this, as some great king by means of an
interpreter, He performed every thing that was worthy of the Divine Power.</p>
<p><b>46.</b> For, if He had done otherwise,--after His dealings among men,--so
as not to have been seen, and had suddenly taken flight, and secretly stolen
away His Interpreter; or had, in escaping, been careful to convey away His Image
from death; or again, had led on that mortal (being) by means of His person, to
corruption and perishing ; He would have seemed to the many (but) as a spectre.</p>
<p><b>47.</b> Nor could He have done any thing, which it was right He should do,
as being the LIFE, the WORD and the POWER of God; having given up His
Interpreter to corruption and ruin.</p>
<p><b>48.</b> Nor, could those things which He did against the Demons, (or) in
His contention with death, have been worthy of completion.</p>
<p><b>49.</b> Nor could it have been known, where He remained.</p>
<p><b>50.</b> Nor could it have been believed by those, to whom He had not
delivered (it) ;--nor had it been seen,--that His nature was superior to death.</p>
<p><b>51.</b> Nor, could He have delivered mortality from its own (mortal)
nature.</p>
<p><b>52.</b> Nor, could He have persuaded His disciples to despise death. <A HREF="#187"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|187</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>53.</b> Nor, could He have established a hope of the life that is with God
after death, with those who drew near for (the reception of) His doctrine.</p>
<p><b>54.</b> Nor, could He have fulfilled the promises of His own words; nor
have given to the prophecies, which went before respecting Him, a due
fulfilment.</p>
<p><b>55.</b> Nor<A HREF="#74"><SUP>74</SUP></A>, could He have overcome in the
last conflict of all, which was opposed to the death that exists in all these
things. For it was above all things right, that this mortal vessel should, after
it had completed the service which it rendered to THE WORD OF GOD, obtain to
itself an end worthy of God, (and that this) be through this same ordinance of
death. For, there were two things resting upon (this) consummation ; (viz.)
either, that He should deliver up (His vessel) to entire corruption and
destruction, and (so) make His whole conflict, and egress from this world,
matter of shame; or, that He should afford proof, that this same was superior to
death; and (so), by the divine power, make immortal that which was mortal. The
first however, was incompatible with the promise. For, it is not the property of
fire, to be cold; nor, of light, that it be dark : neither is it of life, that
it should die; nor, of THE WORD OF GoD, that He should act with impropriety.
For, What cause could He have, who promised life to others, for being unmindful
of His own vessel when subject to corruption:--for delivering up His Image to
destruction, and for surrendering the Interpreter of His own Godhead, to the
corruption of death ?--for Him to do so, who had <A HREF="#188"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|188</SPAN></A>
previously promised to those, who should take refuge in Him, the life which is
impervious death ? This (one) then, of two things was necessary :--this, I say,
that He should shew him (His Interpreter) to be superior to death. And, How was
it, that it was necessary He should do this ? Secretly, and by stealth ? or,
openly before all men, and manifestly? But, if this fact had taken place
covertly and secretly; it would then have remained unknown, and unprofitable to
man. But, as it was preached (to all), and heard of by all; it afforded to all,
the advantage which (grew) out of the miracle. Well therefore,--because it was
necessary He should shew His vessel to be superior to death,-- did He also do
this, not secretly, but before the eyes of (all) men. He escaped not from death;
for this would have been pusillanimous, and it would have been thought that He
was inferior to death. But, by this contention with Death as with a
contemporary, He established the immortality of that which was mortal; and, this
last conflict which was for the salvation of all, secured (for all) the life
which is immortal. For this was done, in the first place, against the Demons,
for the destruction of the error of a multitude of Gods, when He began to be
known among men. It also appeared particularly necessary to Him, that, as He was
to make His circuits among the flocks of men, He should immediately, (and) in
the presence of all, drive out the enemies and haters of mankind,--as being the
princes of wickedness, and like to cruel and fierce beasts, those (I say),--who
had, from former times and falsely, been esteemed Gods. He therefore, <A HREF="#189"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|189</SPAN></A>
THE WORD OF GOD, immediately led out His Vessel into the land of these enemies
and haters,--that (land I say), which the words of mystery style &quot;<i>The
Desert&quot; </i>as (being) destitute of every good thing; and there <i>&quot;forty
days, and as many nights</i><A HREF="#75"><SUP>75</SUP></A><i>,&quot; </i>He
wrought and performed those things of which no mortal knew, and which the eyes
of man did not see. The testimonies however of prophecy teach, that to these
things the declarations of the prophetical Scriptures agree, where it is
written, that &quot;<i>Jesus was led of the Holy Ghost into the desert, that he
might be tempted of Satan. And He was there forty days and forty nights</i><A HREF="#76"><SUP>76</SUP></A><i>,
and was with the wild beasts</i><A HREF="#77"><SUP>77</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>And,
What are these but the <A HREF="#190"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|190</SPAN></A> princes of
the Demons, whom the Holy Ghost has said are,--and has named by way of figure,--&quot;<i>Serpents&quot;
&quot;Adders&quot; </i>&quot;<i>Lions&quot; and &quot;Dragons&quot; </i>on
account, of the similitude to the viciousness of each of these: (saying) &quot;<i>Thou
shalt tread on the serpent and adder, and shalt trample on the lion and the
dragon</i><A HREF="#78"><SUP>78</SUP></A>?&quot;<i> </i>The other things also
which were done in the desert, this declaration intimates, saying thus in the
person of the Vessel which He bore, &quot; <i>His truth shall gird thee </i>(as)
<i>a weapon: neither shalt thou be afraid of the fear of the night, nor of the
arrow that flieth by day; nor of the thing that walketh in darkness: nor of the
wind that bloweth at noon. Thousands shall fall at thy side, and tens of
thousands at thy right hand: but they shall not touch thee</i><A HREF="#79"><SUP>79</SUP></A><i>.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>56.</b> These things have been said in parables and mystically, on the
conflict which (took place) in the desert between the Vessel of salvation, and
the invisible spirits. During all these nights therefore, and days in like
number, He contended with the whole race (of Demons) that was beneath the air.
Nor was it tardily that THE WORD OF GOD drove these out, nor, that He pursued
the whole congregation of the enemy; nor, that (He did this) as God in his
abstract and unembodied power, but, by means of the body which He took. Because
the whole race of man had, from ancient times, been subjected to these as to
Gods: on this account therefore, principally, He subjected all the families of
the Demons to this (His Vessel). For it was right, that He should make him who
had been conquered, and iniquitously subdued to his enemies, not only (man's)
Deliverer, but also the Conqueror of his enemies; and that He (THE WORD) should
shew, <A HREF="#191"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|191</SPAN></A> that His Friend, whom He had
made in His own Image and similitude, was, on account of his participation in
THE WORD, superior to the Demons who were formerly thought to be Gods; just as
it is written in the words of mystery<A HREF="#80"><SUP>80</SUP></A> (the
Scriptures).</p>
<p><b>57.</b> Because then, the Saviour of us all had completed the conflict
which was opposed to these (spirits), He went up thence, clothed (as it were)
with victory, entered upon the life common to men, and delivered their souls:
having relieved them from the bonds of the Demons: and, having revealed to His
Disciples those other secret things,--as well as these which he performed in
opposition to the enemies that are unseen,--He thus spoke, and He established
(it), <i>&quot;Be of good courage, I have overcome the world</i><A HREF="#81"><SUP>81</SUP></A><i>.&quot;
</i>The manner too of His victory, He taught by those things which He said to
His Disciples in parables (viz.): &quot;<i>No man can enter the house of a
strong man and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the. strong man; and then
he shall spoil his house</i><A HREF="#82"><SUP>82</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>He
therefore bound the strong man, and drove out the whole race of Demons. And
forthwith, He (so) wrought on the souls of those who were His, that He freed
them from the bitter state, slavery, and errror, of a multiplicity of Gods. This
His first conflict however against the Demons, was completed at the outset of
His manifestation among men. But the last (His crucifixion), was the
commencement of His sovereignty over Death. <A HREF="#192"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|192</SPAN></A>
For it was right that He,--who was superior to (that which was) no God, and to
the error of Demons, and, had been attached to GOD THE WORD,--should receive the
honour compatible with this His deed (viz.) the victory over Death. For the
Demons, which had assembled together against Him, with their Head, and with the
spirits residing above the earth in the air, (and) invisible to mortal eyes,
turned their backs (in flight) in His first conflict (with them) ; directing
their view to the second, and waiting for His last egress, and departure by
death, from the world, which they expected would be like that of other men. For,
they had no notion that the mortal nature could ever exist, which should be
superior to death ; or, that Death was (not) the common king of all those, who
had once experienced the birth of mortals. They thought too, that this was, of
all evils, that which no man could either avoid, or evade. But, immediately
after the signal mark of His first victory over the Demons, He engaged also in
conflict with Death. And<A HREF="#83"><SUP>83</SUP></A>, just as one wishing to
shew that some vessel was incombustible and its nature superior to fire, could
in no other way establish this astonishing fact, except by placing the one which
he held in his hand in the fire, and then taking it out of the fire, safe and
sound; so also THE WORD OF GOD, the life-giver of all, willing to make it known
that the mortal Vessel, of which He had availed Himself for the redemption of
man, was superior to death, and, to shew that He made it to participate in His
own life, conducted the matter both well and virtuously as it was most
convenient. He left the body for a short time, and consigned mortality to death,
for the rebuking of its (sinful) nature ; and again, <A HREF="#193"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|193</SPAN></A>
He soon raised up the same from death, for the purpose of proving that the
Divine power, which was by Him,-- that eternal life, (I say) which was preached
by Him,-- was superior to every kind of death.</p>
<p><b>58.</b> This<A HREF="#84"><SUP>84</SUP></A> therefore was the first cause.
The second was, to shew that the Divine power resided in the human body. Because
men had formerly made gods for themselves of those who were men mortal in
reality, had been overcome by death, (and) in whom the last common extremity had
been witnessed ; and had named those heroes and gods, who had been taken away by
death; on this account therefore, He happily shewed Himself; and for this cause,
the same compassionate WORD OF GOD exhibited to men, the nature which was
superior to death, and brought in mortality--after its dissolution--to a second
life. He also afforded to all, the means of viewing the signal victory of life
immortal over mortality; and taught (them) by (His) death to confess Him alone
to be the God of truth, who had (so) bound the crown<A HREF="#85"><SUP>85</SUP></A>
of victory over death, about His own head.</p>
<p><b>59.</b> The third cause of (His) death was, the redemption that is
(taught) in hidden (mystical) terms, which are these in effect: He was the
sacrifice which was consigned to death, for the souls of the whole race (of man)
: the sacrifice (I say) which was slain for the whole flock of <A HREF="#194"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|194</SPAN></A>
mankind: the sacrifice turning (men) back from the error of Demons. The
sacrifice therefore,--the great offering, and that which was superior to all
(other) sacrifices,--was the Body of our Saviour which was sacrificed as a Lamb,
for the whole race of mankind: and it came up for the souls of all the nations
that had been held in the impiety of their forefathers, the error of the Demons.
And thence, the whole impure and unholy power of Demons was destroyed ; this
whole vain and earthly system of error, was instantly dissolved and ruined by a
superior power! He therefore who was, from among men, the sacrifice of
Redemption,--the bodily Vessel of THE WORD OF GOD,-- was sacrificed for the
flock of all mankind. And this is He, who was, by the accusation of men,
delivered up as a sacrifice to death; of whom the Divine words exclaim, speaking
at one time thus: <i>&quot;Behold! The Lamb of God: behold! He </i>(it is) <i>who
taketh away the sins of the world</i><A HREF="#86"><SUP>86</SUP></A><i>.&quot; </i>And
at another, thus previously enouncing: &quot;<i>As a Lamb He was led to the
slaughter; and, as a sheep before the shearer, He was silent</i><A HREF="#87"><SUP>87</SUP></A><i>.&quot;
</i>And the same (Divine word) teaches the cause, saying: &quot; <i>Truly He
underwent our sufferings, and bore our pains; but we considered Him bruised and
stricken of God, and humiliated. He was slain because of our sins, and was
humbled because of our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and
by His stripes are we healed. All we have strayed like sheep, and (each) man has
turned to his part; and the Lord has made to meet in him the sins of us all</i><A HREF="#88"><SUP>88</SUP></A>.&quot;
This bodily vessel therefore of THE WORD <A HREF="#195"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|195</SPAN></A>
OF GOD, was, for these reasons, sacrificed. But He, the great High Priest who
officiates as Priest to God, the King of all, and Lord of all, is another
distinct from the sacrifice, (viz.) THE WORD OF GOD, THE POWER OF GOD, and THE
WISDOM OF GOD : He too, after no long time, raised mortality from death, making
him (so raised) by participation, the beginning of the redemption of us all, and
of that immortal life which is with God. Him too, (thus) vested with the mark of
victory over death, and the deeds of the Demons; of those human sacrifices which
had been delivered down from ancient times, did He constitute the Destroyer, for
the sake of all mankind. Hence also was the name of <i>Messiah </i>(Christ)
given to Him; which, among the Hebrews, attaches<A HREF="#89"><SUP>89</SUP></A>
in like manner to the chief priest. He therefore received the two names: the
name of <i>Jesus, </i>implying the sacrifice of <i>salvation; </i>and that of
High Priest, the WORD OF GOD, who officiates as Priest for us all:--the custom
of the Hebrews intimating (this) of the Messiah (Christ.)</p>
<p><b>60.</b> After the things which have been said, the latter was the great
cause of (His) death, viz. the Redemption spoken of<A HREF="#90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>:
because, it was necessary to the disciples that <A HREF="#196"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|196</SPAN></A>
they should see, with their own eyes, the life which was after death, He (thus)
openly taught them to place their hope in this second birth. And, because He
also encouraged them to be strong in the yoke of righteousness, He well
delivered this, in order that they might, with their own eyes, see it. For it
was necessary for these, who were about to be brought to the life of
righteousness, that, first of all, they should receive this most necessary
doctrine by means of open view; and much more, for those who were soon to preach
it throughout the whole creation, and to cause the knowledge of God, (so) given
by them, to arise (as the sun) in all nations, (and) among all men. It was
necessary, that these men should receive the strongest persuasion of the life
which is after death, so that they might accept fearlessly, and unmoved in their
minds<i><sup> </sup></i>by death, the conflict against the error of many gods.
For, if they had not been taught to despise death, neither would they have ever
been prepared to approach afflictions. On this account, He the more particularly
armed them against the power of death. Nor was it by precepts and words (only),
that He delivered to them this doctrine: nor, in persuasive terms or
similitudes, that He composed (his discourses) as men do, on the immortality of
the soul; but He shewed them in the deed itself, the signal mark of the victory
(obtained) over death.</p>
<p><b>61.</b> For death had been, from ancient times, fearful to all men as the
destroyer of our mortal race; its power being considered the undoing of the
whole nature of man, both soul and body. Nor was there ever a man, who could
relieve human nature from this fearful being. All were pierced, <A HREF="#197"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|197</SPAN></A>
(as it were,) small and great, Princes and Subjects, Kings at once and People,
as well as the Inhabitants and Societies of all nations and families, by the
fear of death. Nor had mankind any solace for this evil, either in word, or
form, or manner of life, opinion of the wise, writing of the Ancients, prophecy
of the Prophets, or revelation of Angels. He was superior to all, supreme over
all, and victorious over all! Death, like an inflated boaster,--who had
subjected to himself the whole mortal race,--was conversant with every species
of iniquity, both the impurities of blood-shedding, and the deeds which were
unrighteous; with the error also of every sort of vile (and) ungodly impiety.
For, of all these things he was the Cause; and, as if there were again no
existence after death, the many did in their conduct the things which deserved
death, and as if unsubdued by (the fear of) any impending punishment. On account
of this dissoluteness (resulting) from death, they lived a life which (in
reality) was no life: they entertained not God in their thoughts, nor the
righteous judgment of God : nor did they cherish the remembrance of the rational
Essence of their own souls. They were conversant (only) with the one hard Ruler,
Death; and were reconciled to the corruption resulting from this, which was the
undoing of their whole soul. On this account it was, that they gave the name of
Pluto<A HREF="#91"><SUP>91</SUP></A>,-- the god of riches,--to Death : and Death
became their god ! And not he alone, but also those precious things which were
in his presence, and contributed to a life of lust, became their Gods ! The very
lust of the body therefore, became to them a God ! the common aliments, a God !
the seed which fell into the earth, a God ! the pleasant blossoms of this, a God
! the flowers of the apples, a God ! the pleasure that was in drunkenness, a God
! the love of the body, a God ! and the very lust of these things ! Hence, the
mysteries of Demeter and of Proserpine: as also the rape of the Maid<A HREF="#92"><SUP>92</SUP></A>
to Hell; and again, her return. Hence the feasts of Dionysus (Bacchus)--and of
Hercules--who was overcome as by some great god by drunkenness ! Hence the
mysteries of the adultery of Mars and Venus ! Hence the <A HREF="#198"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|198</SPAN></A>
madness of Jupiter after women, and his love of Ganymede! the rambling stories
about Gods lovers of lust, and attached to the vilest affections! And of all
these, was Death the (originating) Cause: for they believed Death to be the end
and conclusion of all, the dissolution and corruption both of bodies and souls;
and that there was no other life, except this of the body, and which is
corporeal:--living a life worse than that of the whole irrational nature of
beasts! On these accounts, it became the desire of the universal King, THE WORD
OF GOD, at the intimation of His merciful Father, and for the purpose of
affording help to these, to hasten,--as a king great in mercy,--and to undertake
the reprehension of Death, by means of human nature; being as He was, THE LIFE,
THE WORD, and THE POWER. OF GOD. Nor was it but that help should be obtained,
that He caused that fearful being among men to be reproved: on this account, He,
who was incorporeal,--availing Himself of human armoury, and of a mortal body,--by
means of mortality overcame mortality. Hence His primary mystery, that of His
Body, was instituted; and hence, the signal mark of the victory of the Cross;
hence too, the commemoration of the life which is eternal and imniortal, He
named<sup> </sup><i>His remembrance. </i>Of the armoury which is mortal, He
availed Himself, and exhibited that greatest of miracles to all men, the mark of
victory of eternal life, which He established in opposition to Death. For, He
gave up mortality to be food for the beasts<A HREF="#93"><SUP>93</SUP></A>; and
He himself was forthwith affixed to the cross of crucifixion, in order that to
all might become known the nature of mortality. Nor was that which was done
concealed by any means; neither from men, <A HREF="#199"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|199</SPAN></A>
nor from Demons, nor from the Powers which are superior. For it was necessary,
that all should take an accurate view of mortality, as in a great theatre<A HREF="#94"><SUP>94</SUP></A>,
when He (thus) testified of the nature of His (human) person ; and afterwards
(see) Death coming in like a fierce beast: and (also see), why it was that it
slew Him : and (that) then, the Power of life came in after Death, and again
established for all the victory which is over Death, when he had thus made that
which was mortal, immortal. The Power therefore, which had taken hold of him,
(viz.) THE WORD OF GOD, left the Body for a short time; and it was suspended for
a short space on the Cross, and became a corpse. But the WORD, which gives life
to all, became not a corpse. He therefore (thus) attested the mortal nature of
his Person. This corpse too, of which Death had (so) taken possession, was now
borne by men ; and--being worthy of the usual care--was afterwards consigned,
according to the laws of men, to burial. The grave itself was a cave which had
recently been hewn out; a cave that had now been cut out in a rock, and which
had experienced (the reception of) no other body. For it was necessary that it,
which was itself a wonder, should have the care of that Corpse only. For it is
astonishing to see even this rock, standing out erect and alone in a level land,
and having only one cavern within it; lest, had there been many, the miracle of
Him who overcame Death should have been obscured. The Corpse was therefore laid
there, the Vessel of the living WORD ; and a great stone held (the entrance of)
the cave. And much did Death exult in this, as if, behold ! he had (now) taken
even this (Personage) under his power, together with those whom he had ever (so
taken). But, when the period of three days had not yet passed, the same life
shewed itself, after the rebuke which was sufficient against Death<A HREF="#95"><SUP>95</SUP></A>.
For, if He had <A HREF="#200"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|200</SPAN></A> risen earlier (and)
immediately, He would not then have been believed to have been dead. But, since
He was (thus) in reality raised, He had also in reality died; and had, for a
time, been in reality subject to Death ; then also did the all-life-giving WORD
OF GOD evince the hope that is laid up for all men, by means of the second birth
of this selfsame mortal (body) !</p>
<p><b>62.</b> What things then came to pass after these, as to their being
(actually) performed, it is not my intention henceforward to be thy teacher.
Those who saw them will be the witnesses best fitted for the truth (in this
respect); those (I say) who, from having seen the acts themselves, did, both by
their blood and persons, attest their faith in Him; and who, by the power of
Him, to whom they gave their testimony, filled the whole creation with the
righteousness which was preached by them. Those therefore, who were spectators
of the things then done, and who saw with their own eyes the Second Birth which
became theirs <A HREF="#96"><SUP>96</SUP></A>, have delivered (this) by their
own testimonies. It was not indeed, that the things done had been heard of by
them, as far as word or enunciation (went); but, they had been seen, and
accurately felt by those who testified respecting them: and on this account,
these same, who had by open vision and in reality apprehended (these things),
and had received the signal mark of victory over Death, learned well to be
daring against Death; and taught this same thing to their Disciples, (viz.) that
they had received from their Saviour, the truth pertaining to life immortal. And
thus also, was the whole mortal race thence refreshed (as freed) from the fear
of Death: because he, who had formerly been terrific, had suffered rebuke in the
presence of all; and the life which was after death, bad (now) received certain
credibility ; not from the artificial enouncements of Sophists, nor from the
discovery of persuasive words; but, by the deeds which came forth to light. Nor
again, did (men) as formerly tremble at death, but they laughed much and greatly
in the hour of this fearful being; so much so <A HREF="#201"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|201</SPAN></A>
that they even followd after death, on account of (their) desire of that
immortal life, which should succeed it.</p>
<p><b>63.</b> Hence indeed, originated the care of mankind for the life which is
holy and pure, and the diligence to attain to every (sort of) excellency : the
(constant) recollection of God, and of the many enouncements respecting the
righteousness of truth, and of the turning away from vice and ungodliness. Nor
was it this only, but also the true notion of the life which is after death, was
stirred up among all men, and (so was) the right and true state of mind,
respecting the righteous judgment of God, the King of all. On this account did
the whole race of man,--which had (now) been changed to a state of virtue by
means of enouncements not to be described,--henceforward spit in the faces of
the Idols, trample under foot the unjust laws of the Demons, and laugh at the
ancient traditionary system of error of their forefathers.</p>
<p><b>64.</b> Henceforward therefore, men became so instructed in the heavenly
doctrine, and the enouncements respecting the knowledge of God, that they no
more reverentially viewed this visible creation with the bodily eyes; nor, when
looking upwards and seeing the Sun, Moon, and Stars, did they address their
veneration to them: but they acknowledged Him who is beyond these;--Him who is
secret and invisible,--Him who is the Creator of all, and the Maker of every
thing: even as they had been taught to fear Him alone.</p>
<p><b>65.</b> Nor did he, who had been instructed in the new doctrine, again
imagine as formerly, that this nature of the body, which is<i> </i>fleeting and
corruptible, inanimate (in itself,) and irrational;--nor, that the primitive
elements, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire,--were Gods; since he had also been
taught, that the superiority of his own soul greatly excelled these.</p>
<p><b>66.</b> Nor is he as formerly, a slave to his own lusts; nor is he
overcome by the baser desires: for he was then vanquished, and could not
overcome: (nor<A HREF="#97"><SUP>97</SUP></A>) can he, who has <A HREF="#202"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|202</SPAN></A>
been commanded to be careful to root up the sin (of idolatry) from his mind and
soul, together with every evil desire and folly, again fabricate Gods to
himself, or, even dare to look upon a woman lustfully.</p>
<p><b>67.</b> Nor will he again as formerly, venerate the Interpreter <A HREF="#98"><SUP>98</SUP></A>
of his own soul, or dare to call it a God: nor will he name his own mind Minerva<A HREF="#99"><SUP>99</SUP></A>;
nor indeed, any of those other things, which are in like manner but for an hour;
but Him alone who is beyond all, the WORD OF GOD, the Artificer of all, the
WISDOM OF THE GOD OF ALL, will he recognize and bless, as his Saviour.</p>
<p><b>68.</b> Nor again as in former times, does he,--who has subscribed to the
one who alone is superior to Death; to the Conqueror, who has possessed himself
of the signal mark of Victory over the power of Death ; to his Saviour ; --give
the names and appellations of Heroes and Gods, to mortals who left this world in
shame, and surrendered their lives to the dominion of Death.</p>
<p><b>69.</b> Nor again as in former times, will he revere inanimate Idols. Nor
will he honour the nature which is irrational, and of Beasts, through that fear
of Demons which is out of nature. But, he will laugh at the error of his
forefathers, and will turn his face from their manner (of life), which was
destitute both of the knowledge of God, and of the contemplation (of this).</p>
<p><b>70.</b> Nor will he again as in former times, express terror at the images
of evil Demons, nor at the vain and erroneous phantasms of earthly spirits:--he
(I say) who <A HREF="#203"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|203</SPAN></A> is constrained by the
prevailing power of THE ONE WORD the King of all, has been taught to undo
through Him, the whole race of the accusers of men, and (so) to abolish and
expel, both from souls and bodies, these (causes of) injuries.</p>
<p><b>71.</b> Nor will he as formerly, again pollute himself with libations,
fumes, blood, and sacrifices; nor yet with the sacrifices of irrational animals:
much less will he delight himself with the slaughter of men, and with human
sacrifices. He has been taught, that God stands in need of nothing.--Nor will he
delight in bodily matter, nor in the fumes of earthly sacrifices; but only in
the enlightened mind, in purity of soul, and in holiness of life; in the
sacrifices also which are without smoke and blood: those which are in the words
of the mysteries: those (I say) which the Saviour of all has appointed to be
delivered throughout the whole creation of man, for a <i>remembrance of Himself</i><A HREF="#100"><SUP>100</SUP></A><i>.
</i><A HREF="#204"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|204</SPAN></A><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><b>72.</b> Nor again will he, who has been taught by the words of his
Saviour, to &quot;<i>mortify his members that are on the earth</i><A HREF="#101"><SUP>101</SUP></A><i>&quot;
</i>dare, as formerly, to give the title of gods to the aliments of the body,
and to drunkenness; nor yet to the lusts and passions.</p>
<p><b>73.</b> Nor again will he,--who has subscribed to the only <i>One </i>who
is above all, the life-giving WORD OF God, who is his Saviour, and the Conqueror
of Death,--be afraid of the solution of his soul, from the body which (now)
accompanies it. Nor will he call Death, God.</p>
<p><b>74.</b> With all these instructions of righteousness therefore, will he be
armed who has been taught in the new doctrine. Nor will he, in opposition to the
truth, give in <A HREF="#205"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|205</SPAN></A> to those who dare
to contend with God; but will stand up, in the mind (so) confirmed, against fire
and sword; will bear up in the presence of fierce beasts, of the depths of the
sea, and of every other terror of death. Those too, who in their natures are
(mere) children and women, will sport with that death which was formerly (so)
grievous, and the hearing about which was (so) dreadful. Barbarians at once and
Greeks, who have received the powerful persuasion respecting the life which is
immortal, by means of the resurrection of our Saviour, do follow after the life
of that better wisdom, the fear of God, the signal mark of their victory over
death, and of the eternal life which follows, having subscribed to their
Saviour.</p>
<p><b>75.</b> <A HREF="#102"><SUP>102</SUP></A><i> </i>Hence it is, that this
rational race of man,-- since it has been its lot to reside on the earth,--this
same (I say) acts henceforth according to its nature; being taught to live in
the remembrance of God, in the fulness of every good, and in accordance with the
prediction of the prophets, who, many years ago (inspired) from above, thus
previously preached : <i>&quot;All the ends of the earth shall remember
themselves, and be turned to the Lord their God; and before Him shall worship
all the families of the nations: because the kingdom is the Lord's, and He is
Governour over the Gentiles</i><A HREF="#103"><SUP>103</SUP></A>.&quot;</p>
<p><b>76.</b> Hence, places of instruction have been established throughout the
whole creation of man ; so that the words of God, the doctrine of purity of life
and of the fear of God, are preached in the hearing of all nations.</p>
<p><b>77.</b> Hence, in every city and place, congregations (assembled) from
among all, ascribe, in songs of victory, honour to the all-life-giving WORD of
God.</p>
<p><b>78.</b> Hence, the hymns which are suitable to the assemblies of Angels in
heaven, even the race of mankind tenders to God the King of all. And henceforth,--together
<A HREF="#206"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|206</SPAN></A> with those spirits, the
intelligent and unembodied powers that are with God who is above all; those
also, whose lot it is to reside below on this element of earth, as also the
rational souls of the just,--do, by means of the body, as by an instrument of
music, send forth the hymns which are becoming, and the blessings which are due,
to their one Saviour, the cause of every good. And that, which never (before)
existed, the fruit which is due to God the universal King, is now daily rendered
(to Him) throughout the whole creation of man, by every race as by one general
agreement, and at the same befitting hours and seasons<A HREF="#104"><SUP>104</SUP></A>.</p>
<p><b>79.</b> Those genealogies of the Demons, and stories about the Gods, which
are now superannuated, perished when (so) consigned to oblivion. But, the word
of Christ is renewed, and in (vigorous) youth with all. Now are the Divine Laws
and Lessons preached throughout the whole earth, and they succeed in purifying
all men. The instruction too, of the fear of God in truth, has filled all
places, both of the Barbarians and the Greeks. Now do those of foreign, as well
as those of many, languages, send forth in one manner of life, and with one
consent, the ascriptions of blessing which are becoming, to the Creator of all:--one
enouncement, the same Law, and one mystery<A HREF="#105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>,
suitable to God: and to this same conduct do they adhere. Now has there been
established, throughout the whole creation, one combination of souls, and one
accordance of doctrine. And hence, at one moment of time do those whose lot it
is to reside together in the east, along with those at the setting of the Sun,
glorify, by means of the same doctrines, the One God who is beyond all, the Lord
of the whole world. Nor do they subscribe to any other, except only to the
Christ of God, who is the cause of their happiness. Those also, who have
possession of the northern parts, together with those who are in the south, at
once call Him THE SAVIOUR. And, so do they honour God in the same (forms of)
words, that no difference will <A HREF="#207"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|207</SPAN></A>
again soon be made--although it might be imagined as to speech,--between the
Barbarian and the Greek<A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>; nor, that the Greek be
a person to be distinguished from the Barbarian; for with God &quot;<i>there is
neither Barbarian nor Greek</i><A HREF="#107"><SUP>107</SUP></A>.&quot; For
every one fearing God, is (here) a wise man. And now Egyptians, Syrians,
Scythians, Italians, Moors<A HREF="#108"><SUP>108</SUP></A>, Persians, and
Hindoos, all and at once, have be-become wise by the doctrines of Christ. In
these things too are they all, at once made wise, and (so) instructed, as to be
intrepid against Death; to despise the things of this life, and to put forth the
one good hope, which is in the promise of the word of our Saviour. But they also
learn, that they shall receive that life of the soul which is immortal, and
which has henceforth been promised to them as a deposit, in the habitation of
the circle of the heavens, and in the kingdom of God. This promise, their
Saviour confirmed by deeds in His conflict with Death ; by which He proved to
his Disciples, that Death which had (hitherto) been so fearful to all men, was
nothing. The life moreover, which had been promised by Him, He established by
open view to their very eyes; so that they should even see it; and made this His
Image (body), by its resurrection, the commencement of our hope,--of the
imperishable life of our bodies, of the soul as being immortal, and of our
greatness as like to that of the Angels.</p>
<p><b>80.</b> The deeds therefore, pertaining to Redemption and affording aid to
the world, as to the Revelation of THE WORD OF GOD among men, are these. If
however, any one require a greater abundance, so as to be supplied with many
other proofs of the Divine power (in this respect), personal leisure will be
requisite, for the examination of the things which have been written respecting
Him. Of these I will select a few from the writings <A HREF="#208"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|208</SPAN></A>
of His Disciples,--which he previously preached as predicting the things which
should be done by Him,--in proof of his Godhead: and will so lay before those,
who do not acknowledge the conclusiveness of my former statements, this as the
last (and greatest).</p>

C...[Greek]<i> </i>The Syriac speaks here much stronger on the divinity of our
Lord. His words are, [Syriac], which is rendered sufficiently literal above.
These Demons were considered as constituting various classes among the Greeks:
the first residing in the Stars: the second consisting of those who had
benefited mankind by their labours, and were termed Heroes, as Hercules, the
Tyndarides, Bacchus, &amp;c.; the third consisted of those fabulous beings which
had, under the garb of philosophy, been deified by the Poets. The fourth
contained, Venus, Mercury, &amp;c. The fifth contained those said to be famous
for art, as Vulcan, Mars, &amp;c. To these they added a sixth and seventh, who
took at one time the forms of Gods, at another, those of Ghosts (manium). These
all again, were divided into two classes, the one consisting of good, the other
of evil Demons. Prep. Evang. Lib. v. in. p. 182. seq. It is added, from the
authority of Plutarch that, from this last sort, all the Grecian oracles were
given out. See also, ib. Lib. iii. cap. v. p. 141. Of all these,&#8212;according to

Mark xv. 42.) It could not have recurred, therefore <i>every seventh day : </i>that
was impossible. The Jews do however, observe every seventh day. They have
therefore, lost the sabbath of Moses entirely. While the Christians actually

<p><A NAME="#75"></A>75.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> The various methods had recourse to
for the purpose of explaining this portion of scripture, may he seen in
Kuinoel's commentary on Matt. iv. 1. Poole's Synopsis, ib. and on the parallel
places. The comment given by Eusebius here is, certainly, a bold one. It is
nevertheless, as I think, very much superior to that preferred by Kuinoel; viz.
that the Devil here represents the high Priest of the Jews, who sent out his
emissaries to Christ for the purpose of securing <i>his </i>influence, if
possible, in favour of their policy. See the commentators on Matt. iv. with its
parallel places. As I do not see any necessity here for departing from the
simple and obvious declarations of the Evangelists, I will only remark, that our
Lord seems to have been led to this, for the express purpose of being tempted,
or tried, by Satan, [Greek] says St Matthew. Comp. Mark i. 13, Luke iv. 2. And,
as Demoniacal influence is repeatedly and positively taught in the New
Testament, I do not see why this should be doubted. It is certain moreover, that
this Demoniacal influence was restrained by our Lord, and that these Demons knew
Him. See Matt. viii. 28-32; xii. 22-29; xvii. 18-21. Mark i. 23-26, 34, &amp;c.
with their parallels. He also gave power to His disciples over these unclean
spirits, Matt. x. 1. Luke ix. 1: and over all the power of the enemy, ib. x. 19.
Ib. ver. 18, He speaks of Satan falling from heaven. Again, these spirits could
not have been ignorant of the birth of Christ, as announced by the Angels and
others, Luke ii. 9-15. ib. ver. 25. seq. comp. ib. xxi. 14-22. From all which it
must appear, that these were <i>real beings, </i>at once <i>intelligent and
potent; </i>and that our Lord actually restrained, and otherwise overcame, them.
The temptation in the desert was therefore probably intended, among other
things, to shew them that the Redeemer was now come, and that Jesus was that
very person. Eusebius is therefore, in the main, right; although it does not
appear necessary to have recourse to all the figures which he has introduced.</p>

must be an error, for [Syriac]. I have, therefore, translated it accordingly by <i>attaches.
</i>In the Hebrew, the signification of Messiah, [Hebrew] <i>anointed. </i>The
priests, kings, and others, were so styled, because consecrated to their offices
by <i>the anointing of oil, </i>as our Lord was by an extraordinary portion of
the Spirit. (See Is. LXI.). <i>Christ </i>in the Greek signifies the same thing.
See also Demonstr. Evang. Lib. iv. cap. xi. ib. xvi. p. 184.</p>
<p><A NAME="#90"></A>90.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Our author seems, in this article, to
have had strongly impressed on his mind the distinction made by the Apostle,
when he speaks of Christ in his human character only; e. g. &quot;Since <i>by
man </i>came death, <i>by man </i>came also the resurrection of the dead.&quot;
1 Cor. xv. 21. So ib. ver. 47. &quot;The <i>first man </i>is of the earth.. .the
<i>second man </i>is the Lord,&quot; &amp;c. So 1 Tim. ii. 5. &quot; <i>The man </i>Christ
Jesus:&quot;...&quot;who gave himself a ransom,&quot; &amp;c. Again, Heb. viii.
3; x. 12. &quot;<i>This man,&quot; </i>speaking of Christ as a Priest, comp. ib.
iii. 3; vii. 4, 24, &amp;c. and of His Body, ib. x. 5, 10. The Apostle however,
makes no such distinction in his names : nor was it necessary he should. This
distinction in Eusebius is, nevertheless, valuable.--Orat. de laudd. Constant.
ib. p. 541. C. where the Greek leaves us; but has the following matter, ib. p.
540. A. B. seq. See also Demonstr. Evang. Lib. iv. cap. x. p. 164. D.</p>

<p><A NAME="#93"></A>93.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup><i> </i>Allusion seems here to be made
to P.s. lxxiv. 14, in which we are told, that God brake the <i>heads of the
Leviathan, and gave him to be meat to the </i>people inhabiting the wilderness.
(Gr. <font face="SPIonic">Ai0qi/oyi</font> ),<i> </i>taking the Leviathan as
representing the evil principle which had corrupted mortality. Comp. Is. xxvii.
1, and see my notes on Job xli. 1. Our author probably means, that He gave up
His body to men, &amp;c. who might be termed beasts, because of the fierceness
of their nature. Comp. Ps. xxii. 12, 13, 16, 21.</p>
<p><A NAME="#94"></A>94.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> So Paul, Col. ii. 15. &quot;And
having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a shew of them openly,
triumphing over them in it&quot; (His cross).</p>
<p><A NAME="#95"></A>95.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> I. e. to prove that he really died.
This was, no doubt, intended to have its force against the Docetae, who held
that it was a phantom only of Christ which had been affixed to the cross, and <i>appeared
</i>to die, (which the Mohammedans, after these, still hold)--and thus virtually
denying a vital point in the faith of a Christian.</p>
<p><A NAME="#96"></A>96.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Syr. [Syriac] lit. <i>which
apprehended them: </i>alluding perhaps, to Philip, iii. 12<i>, </i>where the
text of the Peschito uses this word in the same way.</p>
<p><A NAME="#97"></A>97.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> I think it highly probable that the
Syriac negative, [Syriac] has in this place been lost, by the mistake of some
copyist.</p>
<p><A NAME="#98"></A>98.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Applying this term, as on several

<p><A NAME="#99"></A>99.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Syr. [Syriac],<i> </i>the Greek <font face="SPIonic">0Aqh&amp;nh</font>,

<p><A NAME="#100"></A>100.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> As this place is extremely
important on the question of the Eucharist, I shall give the Syriac, which runs
thus : [Syriac]. Nothing can be more certain, I think, than that the <i>bodily
and bloody sacrifice </i>of the Mass of the Romanists could not have been
intended here. On the opinions of the Syrian Fathers respecting this mystery,
sec my Visitation Sermon, (Cambridge, 1839,) with the notes. It is my intention,
Deo volente, to publish a more detailed account of the opinions of the Syrian
Fathers on this subject, as soon as I can ; and for this, I have collected
considerable materials. I will now give a sentence or two from the celebrated
Bar Salibi, -- a great favourite with the Romanists, -- on John vi. 63. &quot; <i>It
is the spirit that quickeeneth,&quot; </i>&amp;c. This Father says, [Syriac]
i.e. It is necessary that the words said by me should <i>be spiritually </i>received,
so that you may inherit eternal life. But, if you receive them <i>bodily, </i>you
shall not be profited. For, <i>bodily </i>is, that a man doubt and say, How can
He have descended from heaven, when we think him to be the son of Joseph? and,
How can this man give his body ?--Good Dr Wiseman however, the indefatigable
propugner of the Roman Catholic doctrines, has no doubt, that the Jews <i>were
right </i>in giving the interpretation which this Father reprobates! and also,
that Bar Salibi was an upholder of his own opinions! (See my Sermon, pp. 89,
100, 135--6.) Eusebius himself has, moreover, given his view of the nature of
the Eucharist, in his Demonstratio Evangelica, (Lib. i. x. 39. A.) in the
following words: speaking of the XL. Psalm, he says, [Greek]<i>. </i>Much the
same is said a little higher up (ib. p. 37.) on Is. liii. Again, (ib. p. 39,) he
terms these sacrifices, [Greek] See the rest of this Book to the end, where he
admirably shews, that it was this sort of sacrifice which was constantly
foretold under the Old Testament. So also Origen contra Cels. Lib. viii. p. 416,
[Greek]<i> </i>But the most remarkable passage to this effect occurs in
Theodoret. Dialog. ii. &quot;Inconfusus.&quot; Tom. iv. p. 85. B. [Greek] See my
Visitation Sermon, notes, p. 155, and the opinions of the Syrian Fathers, ib. p.
136. seq.</p>

however, I have succeeded in giving its meaning.</p>
<p><A NAME="#103"></A>103.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Ps. xxii. 27, 28. Differing from
the Peschito only in the addition of [Syriac], <i>their God. </i>Cited also
Demonstr. Evang. Lib. ii. cap. i. v. p. 40. Where our author has, and in the
