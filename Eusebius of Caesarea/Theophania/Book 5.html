</P>
<p><b>1.</b>  SUCH as these (then), are the proofs of the Divine manifestation
of the common Saviour of all, Jesus the Christ, which have been thus far visible
to the eyes, shewing forth at once the Divine words and deeds. For in ancient
times, the words, of which we have already spoken, as to things which should
come to pass, were simply heard ; those (I say) which He prophesied to His
disciples when He was near, (and) in their presence. But now, in our times, the
fulfilment of these words is openly viewed in fact, with powers eclipsing that
of all mortal nature. And, if men will not be persuaded of these things, we
ought not to wonder: because man is accustomed so to resist the clearest things
(possible,) as to dare to oppose in his assertions even the existence of an
universal Providence, and thus also even to deny God Himself! And thus
disingenuously, will he also contend against many other things, to which the
truth (itself) bears testimony. But, as the injurious conduct of these detracts
in no respect from the word, which is in (its own) nature true; so also will the
wickedness of the unbelief of men, injure in no respect the evident excellency
of the Godhead of our Saviour. Let us not deign therefore, even in word to
attach ourselves to these. For those, whom the works of God will not persuade,
the word of man will be (too) abject to move. Nevertheless, let us again take up
the more vigorously, those things against such, which we formerly investigated
by questions<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, in proof of the Gospels. If therefore
ally one should, after all this, impugn the truth and dare disingenuously to
affirm, that the Christ of God was not (such) as we believe He was, but was a
magician, seducer, and <A HREF="#286"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|286</SPAN></A> impostor;
we would present to him, as an infant in mind, those things which we also
formerly investigated:--
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Against those who suppose that the Christ of God was a magician and
  deceiver.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>2.</b> <sup><A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> </sup>Let us now ask then,
Whether there ever was a man heard of at any period, who (as) a magician and
deceiver, was (also) a teacher of humility, meekness, purity, and of every other
virtue? And, Whether it is just to call by these names, Him who would not allow,
that (men) should even look upon women with evil desire? And, Whether he could
be a magician, who delivered the chief philosophy by teaching His disciples,
that the indigent should of their wealth<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> adhere to
Him, and that compassion and liberality should abound with them? And, Whether He
could be a magician, who forbade the assembling together of ferocious and
tumultuous inhabitants, and taught them to love the retirement only, which
devotes itself to the word of God ? How could He,--who deterred from every
species of falsehood, and commanded that men should so honour truth above all
things, that they should not stand in need of a true oath, much less of a false
one,--be justly named a magician? But, What need can there be, that I should now
say many <A HREF="#287"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|287</SPAN></A> things (on this point,)
since we may readily inform ourselves from His own words,--which have, even to
this day, been preached throughout the whole earth,--what the sort of conduct
was, which was disseminated by Him in the world ? Every one who loves the truth
will confess of Him, not only that He was neither magician nor deceiver, but was
THE WORD OF GOD in truth, and the teacher of the divine philosophy and
righteousness; and not of this common philosophy of the world ;--</p>
<p><b>3.</b> But the things pertaining to His form of doctrine were such as
these.--Come then, let us enquire whether this His error, consisted in (any of)
the many things of His teaching. Observe then, <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>Was
it not God, the King of all, Him alone, of whom it is written that He is the
cause of every good thing, that He taught and presented to His disciples ? And,
Do not the words of His doctrine to this very time, raise the mind of every
Greek and Barbarian in existence, to the God who is supreme, to Him (I say) who
is the maker of the heavens and of the earth, and of the whole world; making
(them) overleap all visible nature, and every thing fabricated ? Was this then
His error ? or, Was it, that He did not allow those to worship many gods,--to
whom it had been made clear, from this worship of God only, that He could not be
convicted of falsehood:--(and) who had fallen after their Head, on account of
this real error? But this was not new, nor was it His word (only), but that of
those Hebrews, friends of God, who arose in ancient times. And from them it was,
that these recent (true) philosophers were aided in these great (performances),
and gave in to their doctrines: the wise men of Greece too, glorying in the
divinations of their <A HREF="#288"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|288</SPAN></A> deities, have
put it thus on record of the Hebrews, that &quot;<i>wisdom came to the Chaldeans
alone, and the Hebrews purely worshipped the Essence of the person of God, the
King of all</i><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>.&quot;</p>
<p><b>4.</b> If then those ancient friends of God,--those to whom (these)
divinations have more particularly home testimony,--did raise the act of worship
(directing it) to the God who is over all; How should we confess of Him, that He
was a deceiver, and not a most wonderful teacher, who has extended this worship
of God--as to the things which were known only in former times to these
descendants of the Heads of the Hebrew fathers,--to all mankind ! And this to
such a degree, that no more, as in those times, a few, and those easy to be
numbered, hold the orthodox<sup> </sup>faith respecting God; but thousands of
congregations of barbarians at once, and of those who in ancient times were
perfectly savage, also of the wise, and men of Greece,--of those (I say) who
now, like the prophets and just men of old, have been taught in the worship of
God, solely by means of His power, and of His instruction !</p>
<p><b>5.</b> But, let us also investigate this third (consideration). Was it
then for this, that they called Him a deceiver (viz.), because He taught, that
men should no more honour God with the slaughter of bulls, or with the
sacrifices of irrational animals ? Neither with blood and fire, nor with <A HREF="#289"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|289</SPAN></A>
incense, which are of the earth, because these things are of small value and
earthly ; and shewed that they never could comport with the nature which is
immortal and incorporeal?-- determined also that to keep the commandments of
God, and by their means to purify both the soul and body, was more acceptable
and becoming to God, than any sort of sacrifice ?--inculcated too that men
should be careful to become like God, both in enlightenment of mind, and in the
knowledge of his worship ? And, should any one of the Greeks find fault with
these things, let him know that it is not to be imagined, that the things (so)
received are against (even) those of His own teachers, who have put much
together on this (matter,) viz.; That (men) should not suppose they honoured God
by means of blood and the sacrifices of irrational animals, or by those of fire,
smoke, and the fumes of fat<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> We know too that we are, after these things, taught by Him that the
world was made; and that these Heavens, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, are
the work of God; and that it is not right we should worship these, and not Him
who is the Maker and Creator of them all. It may be well therefore for us to
see, how He could have deceived men, from whom we have learned to think that
this system (of things) is nothing new, but is that of the Hebrews, the ancient
friends of God. Even this sentiment was also from these famous philosophers;--they
delivered these same (particulars), affirming that these beavens, the sun, the
moon, the stars, and the whole world, were also made by Him, who is the Creator
of all things. He also taught us to believe, that the soul which we possess is
immortal, and that it is in no respect like the animals that are irrational, but
that (the faculties) within it resemble the powers of God. He likewise taught,
that all those who were barbarian and ignorant, should (at once) make this their
own, and be, and know. And, How was it, that we were not made wise by those
sages among the Egyptians, <A HREF="#290"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|290</SPAN></A> or by
those Greeks who made broad their foreheads<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>; those
who said that the soul which was in man, was in no respect better in its essence
than were gnats, fleas, worms, or reptiles; nor even, than the soul of the
serpent, the viper, the bear, or the panther? and that swine, as to their soul,
differed in no respect, (from men) ?--</p>
<p><b>7.</b> And, that after these things, He perseveringly admonished (men) of
the judgment of God, and of the punishments and vengeance,--things from which we
cannot be exempt,--which are recorded against the wicked; also, of the promises
of eternal life, of the kingdom of heaven, and of the life of happiness with
God, respecting the just. Whom then did He deceive ? Did He not rather stimulate
(men) to hasten on to virtue, because of the victories reserved for the
righteous ? and, to flee from, and repel from them, every vice, because of the
punishments to be inflicted on the wicked ? Such then, being the instructions
contained in the doctrinal ordinances of our Saviour; What room does there
remain for imagining, that we should suppose Him to have been a Deceiver and
Magician ?--But, let us also investigate these things.--</p>
<p><b>8.</b> When a magician associates his companions with the things of this
vice, Like to what men does he make <A HREF="#291"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|291</SPAN></A>
them ? Is it not to magicians, deceivers, and fabricators of magical drugs,--in
all respects like himself ? Was there ever, then, a man found among the whole
Christian race, who fabricated magical rites or drugs, from the doctrine of our
Saviour ? There is no (such thing) existing for any man to say; but, the
contrary to this, that they have been seen passing over to the precepts of the
philosophy which is Divine. How then, can He be justly styled other, in truth,
than the Teacher of the life which worships God, the common Saviour of all,--who
became throughout the whole habitable world, and to all nations, the (sole)
cause of purity and of holiness of life, and of the knowledge (inculcating) the
worship of the Creator of all things <i>?</i></p>
<p><b>9.</b> Those too, who adhered to Him from the first, as well as those who
afterwards received the traditionary account of the manner of their
conversation, were, as to all these matters, so far removed from suspicion of
evil and bitterness, that they did not even allow the sick to do many things
which the many dared to do; either, that they should write (charms) upon
tablets, or make use of amulets; or, that they should in their minds have
respect to those who promised to use enchantments; or, that they should
prescribe for the persons (of the sick), as cures for complaints, either the
fumes of roots, or of apples, or of any other similar things. All these things
were therefore, excluded from the doctrine of our Saviour: nor was there ever a
Christian to be found who used amulets, or <A HREF="#292"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|292</SPAN></A>
enchantments, or the means of written tablets, or, indeed, any other forms
allied to these; the indiscriminate use of which was in repute among the many.
What then can be said against the men who had been instructed in these things,
so as to cast the imputation on them, of their having been the disciples of a
master who was a magician ? when, behold, the association of any one among the
disciples, who promised any (new) doctrine, was severely reprehended! Those men
therefore both of art and science, to whom He was the cause of their (christian)
instruction, fully confessed of Him, that He was much their superior (in these
respects). For, even as physicians are witnesses of the goodness of the doctrine
of their master ; so, of geometricians, Who has assigned any other instructing
heads, except geometricians ? and of arithmeticians, except arithmeticians ? And
in like manner, of the magician, the best witnesses as to these things have been
His disciples, who have (always) fully resembled their Master, and have done (as
he did). But no man has ever been found, during all these years, a magician and
(at the same time a) Disciple of our Saviour; when, behold, kings and governours
have, during the whole of these times, made the most careful inquiries into
(these) things by means of the worst of torments !</p>
<p><b>10.</b> And thus indeed, neither was there (ever) any magician His
Disciple, so as to be left free and exempt from every (sort) of condemnation;
being only reduced by them (the persecuting emperors) to sacrifice<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> But, that our discourse may not wander from Scripture, take the
proof of these things even from the writings of those primitive acquaintances
and Disciples of our Saviour, (as found) in the book of their own &quot;<i>Acts.&quot;
</i>They so wrought upon those of the Gentiles who received their doctrine, that
many of these,--who formerly accused them of magic,--so entirely changed their
conduct, that they boldly brought forward the abominable books which they had
formerly kept secret, to them into the midst of the <A HREF="#293"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|293</SPAN></A>
assemblies, and threw them into the fire in the presence of all. Hear then the
statement of these things, which runs thus:--</p>
<p><b>12.</b> &quot;<i>The</i><A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><i> greater part then
of those who practised magic brought in their books, and burnt them in the
presence of all men; and they reckoned their price, and it was found, that they
were worth fifty thousand&quot; </i>(pieces of silver).</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Such<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> therefore were the Disciples
of our Saviour, and such was the entire power of the word, which they put forth
in their discourses with (their) hearers, that it became fixed in the depths of
their souls;--were so struck and inclined, that every one took up the resolution
no more to suffer those things to remain hidden, by which the many had formerly
been implicated in error, but that these secret things should be brought out
into the light, and that they should become witnesses against themselves, of
their own former wickedness. Such also were those who became their Disciples, so
pure, noble in soul, and abundant in love, that they allowed nothing impure to
remain concealed within them, but, on the contrary, they gloried and exulted in
their change from vice to virtue. Since<sup><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> </sup>therefore,
the Disciples of our Saviour were seen to be such, Must not their Master have
first been much more excellent? But, if you wish to know from those who are
Disciples, of what sort their Master was, you have tens of thousands of the
Disciples of the precepts of our Saviour even to this time; of whom there are
multitudes of congregations of men, who have armed themselves against the lusts
of the nature of the body, and have accustomed themselves to preserve their
minds uninjured by any of the evil passions : those (I say), who have passed
their whole lives, (and) grown old in purity ; and have put forth, from the
provisions of His word, the most brilliant examples (to others).</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Nor<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> was it that men only were in
this manner (attached) to Him, and became Philosophers; but also <A HREF="#294"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|294</SPAN></A>
tens of thousands of women throughout the whole creation; those (I say), who
like Priestesses of the supreme God, attached themselves to the most exalted
service, and applied themselves to the love of the wisdom which is heavenly. On
the generation of the body they cast contempt, giving all care to their soul,
keeping themselves in purity from every thing sordid and unclean, and extending
their desires<sup> </sup>to all holiness and to virginity<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>.
The Greeks, indeed, sing of one shepherd who left his place for the sake of
philosophy, and him they hawk about here and there. This was Democritus<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>.
They also express their astonishment at one Crates<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>,
who gave his possessions to his citizens. He then <A HREF="#295"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|295</SPAN></A>
took with him himself alone, and boasted in the provisions of liberty. But these
counterparts of the word of our Saviour, are tens of thousands in number; nor
was it one, or two (only), who sold their possessions and distributed them to
the poor and needy: indeed we ourselves are witnesses, that these were even such
among men ; and, in the effects themselves, we have seen the righteousness of
the doctrine of our Saviour. And, What need can there be that we should say, how
many myriads even of the barbarians themselves, and not (of these) only, but
also of the Greeks, have, by the doctrine of the words of our Saviour, been
raised above every error of a plurality of gods, and have recognized and
confessed the one only God, the Father and Creator of this whole world? Him (I
say), whom one Plato formerly knew, but confessed that he durst not speak of Him
before all men; because such power as all this of God's worship was not with
him: but to these the Disciples of our Saviour it was, through the help of their
Lord, easy to acknowledge Him, and to find Him (at hand as) the Father and
Creator of all. To every race of men did they reveal Him, and so preached the
knowledge of Him to all, throughout the whole creation, that, from their
teaching, there are even to this time, among all nations, tens of thousands of
congregations, not only of men, but also of women, children, slaves, and
villagers! All this (then accrued to them) from this philosopher, so that <A HREF="#296"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|296</SPAN></A>
they were not wanting, not only to make Him known (as) the Maker and Creator of
this whole world, but they also became his ambassadors in every place. Such were
the victories of the common Saviour of all; these, the deceptions of Him who was
thought to be a Deceiver<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>! While, behold, such
alone were His Disciples and acquaintances; from whom it was (but) right, we
should learn of what sort their Master was.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Come<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> then, let us again try the
matter thus,-- You say of Him that He was a magician; and not (only so,) but,
that He was a maker of magicians. You style Him cunning, and a deceiver. How
then was it, that He was the first, and the only one, who has arisen capable of
this matter? Or, Is it (not) right we should, according to custom, ascribe the
cause to the Teachers ? If then He was the first and only one capable of this;--no
one having taught Him, and He having never learned any thing from others, nor
yet derived it from the ancients;-- How is it not then incumbent on us to
confess of Him, that His nature was Divine? He (I say), who without book,
without precepts, and without teachers, (so) learned of Himself, and was seen to
know from Himself, the Maker of all these things? when, observe, it is
impossible for any one to acquire a knowledge of the art of the goldsmith, of
logic, or of the primitive elements (of the world), without some one to instruct
and teach him. But, if He was out of nature;--and no one ever, (so) taught of
himself, came out a teacher of grammar, or of rhetoric; not having previously
been taught; nor, has there been a physician, or builder, or practitioner of any
other art: these things being but small, and belonging to men; but this, one
might say, is of the Teacher of the whole habitable world; (viz.) that He
performed the miracles recorded in the Scriptures, (and) <A HREF="#297"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|297</SPAN></A>
whose Disciples (taught) by Himself were such; having received nothing from the
ancients, neither having had any help from those moderns who performed things
not unlike what others had done, who had preceded Him;--What other thing can we
testify or confess, but that the matter is in truth Divine, and such as exceeds
all human nature<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>?</p>
<p><b>16.</b> But. you say of Him that He had deceiving teachers, and that
neither the sciences of the Egyptians, nor those mysteries which were formerly
preached among them, escaped Him: that from these He collected together (His
doctrines), and that He seems to have been a man of this description<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>.--If
then others, His superiors, appeared before Him, and were His teachers, whether
in Egypt or elsewhere<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>; Why did not the fame of
these also run forth, prior to His name among all men, just as His has done?
and, Why is not the praise of them also proclaimed, even to this time, just as
His has been ? and, Who is the magician, of those who arose at any time,
Barbarian or Greek, who was the teacher of such disciples; the originator of all
such laws and precepts as these are; and has shewed forth the power of (this)
the common Saviour of all ? and, of Whom has it ever been written, that He did
such cures as those which have been recorded of our Saviour?--The knowledge too
of something to come to pass, with all those <A HREF="#298"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|298</SPAN></A>
predictions ? those too, which like these, have by their means been laid down as
principles, What other has, either before, or after Him, been memorialized as
having delivered ? and, Who is it that has promised that he would effect those
things, throughout the whole habitable world, which he had (so) predicted, and
has, in fact, so confirmed His words, that, even to these our times, the
fulfilment of His predictions is visible to our own eyes ? And, Whose disciples
and eye-witnesses of the things themselves (here had in view), have ever so
sealed the truth regarding those which they attested of their Lord, by the trial
of both fire and sword, as these Disciples of our Saviour have done ?--who
(indeed) bore the reproach of all men, for the sake of the things which they had
seen and witnessed of Him, and submitted to every species of torment; while the
end of their testimony respecting Him was, as that of the Son of God ! How much
less would magicians seal with their blood their testimonies? And, Which of the
magicians, even if it ever came into his mind to set up a new people in his own
name, did not only think of doing this, but also gave effect to his project ?
How would not this eclipse all human nature, that he should also frame laws
opposed to the error of a plurality of Gods, and adverse to the ordinances of
Kings, Legislators, Philosophers, Poets, and Theologians? and, that he should
send these forth and shew, through the period of a long life, that they were (at
once) triumphant and faultless?</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Which<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> of the magicians is it, who
ever projected that which our Saviour did ? But, if one did so project; still he
dared not to advance this. But, if one so dared; still he brought not the matter
to effect. He (the Saviour) said in one word and enouncement to His Disciples,
&quot;Go <i>and make disciples of all nations in my name, and teach ye them
every thing that I have commanded you</i><A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>.&quot;<i>
</i>And the deed He made to follow the word. For thence, every race of the
Greeks and Barbarians became at once, and in a short space of time, (His)
Disciples: The laws too of our <A HREF="#299"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|299</SPAN></A>
Saviour were not written in any Book of His; but, without book<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>,
were disseminated at His command among all nations; (and) these were opposed to
the ancient worship of a plurality of Gods:--laws at enmity with the Demons, and
unfriendly to every error of a multitude of Deities :--laws purifying the
Scythians, the Persians, and other Barbarians, and converting (them) from every
savage, and lawless sort of life:--laws subversive of the customs, which had
obtained from ancient times among the Greeks, and teaching the new and genuine
worship of God. How then have they dared so (to advance) such things as these,
that one should say of Him, that He was probably aided (in) this magic by
others,--the ancient magicians,--who were before His times<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>?
But, if there was no other person, whom any one could say resembled Him ;
neither was there consequently, who could have been the cause of His possessing
all this superiority.--It is now time therefore that we should confess, that an
extraordinary and Divine Nature came into the world, which first and alone
performed the things which had never before been commemorated among men.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> Let us again ask, after these things, Whether any one ever saw
with his eyes, or learned by hearing, that there were magicians such as He was,
and composers of <A HREF="#300"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|300</SPAN></A> (magical) drugs,
who, without libations, sacrifices, and invocations of Demons, performed the
rites of magic ? When, behold, it is well known and clear to every one, that the
whole process of magic is usually effected by these things. For, How can any one
bring an accusation of this sort either against our Saviour, or against his
Disciples, or against those who are, even to these times led by His doctrine ?
Is there a man who can bring such an accusation as this against them? Is it not
evident, even to the blind, that we are prepared for every thing the reverse of
these things ? And that we dare to surrender up ourselves to death in an instant
? but that we will not sacrifice to Demons :--that we instantly submit to be put
out of life; but do not submit to be subjected to Demons! And, Who is he who
knows not how delightful it is to us, that, through the name of our Saviour,
(coupled) with prayers that are pure, we cast out every kind of Demon ? And thus
the word of our Saviour, and the doctrine which is from Him, have made us all to
be greatly superior to the power which is invisible, and impervious to inquiry;
and, (such) that we are ready to be enemies and haters of the Demons, but not
that we should be friends, or followers, of (their) customs; much less be
subjected and obedient (to them). How then could He have been a slave to the
Demons, who delivered such things as these, to those who were devoted to
Himself? And, How could He have sacrificed to evil spirits? Or, How could He
have called upon the Demons (as His) assistants and helpers, when all the Demons
and impure spirits have been agitated, as by some torment or punishment even to
this very time, at the mention of His name ? (and) have departed and fled before
His power, as it was the case in former times, when He conversed with men, when
they could not bear to see Him ; (one and) another, crying out from another
place, and saying, &quot; <i>What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God ? Art
thou come to torment us before the time?&quot;</i> <A HREF="#301"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|301</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Now, Is not the man whose mind is intent on magic only,--and is
wholly addicted to things (thus) base,-- in his character openly odious, vile,
corrupt, iniquitous, ungodly, and impious ? And being such, Whence, and How, can
he teach others, either the things which pertain to the worship of God, or which
respect purity ? or, which concern the knowledge of God ? or, which are on the
immortality of the soul ? or, which inculcate righteousness, and the judgment of
God who is over all? Would he not be an ambassador of the things which are
opposed to all these? persevering in those that attend on hatred, and the denial
of God ? and rooting up as fabulous the (doctrine of a) general providence of
God ? and laughing at the words which treat of virtue, and (affirm) of the soul
that it is immortal ? If indeed, such things as these had been witnessed (of
Him), then would there have been nothing, even respecting this our (Teacher),
which we could have said to the contrary<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>. But, if
in all His words and His deeds, He was seen to call upon God who is over all,
and King of all; and prepared his Disciples to be such; and, if He was Himself
temperate, and a Teacher of temperance ; if too, He was a doer and a preacher of
righteousness, of truth, of mercy, and of every virtue; and, if He shewed forth
the worship of God, the King of all; How does it indeed not follow upon these
things that we should think of Him, that not one of those wonderful acts which
He did was done by magic ? and confess that it was, in truth, by the unseen
power of God<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> ?</p>
<p><b>20.</b> These things then, are directed (against) those who dare, with
ungodly mouths, to blaspheme against Him. But if they change and confess of Him,
that He was a teacher of purity and sobriety of life, and a bringer in of the
doctrine of the (true) worship of God; still, that He was no doer of those
wonderful, powerful, and miraculous works which are recorded of Him, or of those
divine deeds which are superior to man; and, that His Disciples <A HREF="#302"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|302</SPAN></A>
have fabricated these same; it is now time that we should also meet this
accusation.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Against those who do not believe the testimony of the Disciples of our
  Saviour, respecting His miraculous deeds.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>21.</b> If <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> then (these) should say of Him, that He wrought no
complete miracle, nor yet any of those wonderful works of which His disciples
bore testimony, but that His disciples have otherwise falsely stated them, and
have lied for the purpose of putting forth miraculous relations about Him ; let
us see whether the word of these is to be taken as satisfactory: there being no
(earthly) cause that they can assign, why they the Disciples, and He their
master, went forth into the world. For He who teaches, gives a promise of some
doctrine: and they again, the Disciples, love both the precepts and doctrines,
as if (conveying) some (valuable) art<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>, and give themselves up
(accordingly) to the Teacher. What ground therefore, can there be for any one to
speak against the disciples of our Saviour, on account of their conversation
with Him ? And, What could have pressed them to this care respecting Him, and
that they should have recorded Him (as) the teacher of such doctrines to
themselves ? Or, Is (not) this clear ? For the things which they learned of Him,
they also declared fully to others: and these were the appointments of this His
philosophy. They<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> were too, the first ambassadors of God
<A HREF="#303"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|303</SPAN></A> who is over all, of the providence of God, of the righteous judgment (of
God,) of the soul's being immortal, of the distinction between the life of the
good and the bad, and of other things of this kind, which are written in their
Scripture. It was also a precept pertaining to the life of this philosophy,
which He laid down for them when He said, &quot;<i>Possess ye neither gold nor
silver in your purses, neither scrip for the way</i><A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A><i>,''? </i>with other similar
things: but (His great precept was), that they should give up their souls, only
to the providential care of the Governour of all, and not be anxious on account
of want. And He so instructed them, that they should consider (His precepts)
much better than those which Moses delivered to the Jews. For he laid down a law
for them, --as for men to whom murder would be easy,--that they should not kill.
And in like manner, that they should not commit adultery, as to men dissolute
and adulterous. And again, that they should not steal, as to men to whom slavery
would be suitable; and, that they should not injure, as to men who were
fraudulent<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>. But of these, He knew that it was desirable they should stand
in need of no such laws; but that this should above all things be precious in
their sight, (viz.) that their soul should be subject to no (evil) passion; and
that they should root up and expel from the bottom of their heart, as from its
root, the germ of (every) vice; (and,) that they should be superior to wrath,
and every base desire: that is to say, that they should not even be angry,
because of the superiority of their soul, as being free from passion ; that they
should not look upon a woman with evil desire; that they should so labour
against theft, that they should give of their own to them that needed; and
further, that they should not glory in this, that they injured none, <A HREF="#304"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|304</SPAN></A>
but (rather) in this, that those who wished to injure them, they bore with
without anger<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>. But, What need is there that I should collect
together all the things which He, and they, taught ? He also counselled them,--together,
with all these things,--that they should be so confirmed in the truth, as not to
be under the necessity of giving even a true oath, much less a false one: but
that they should so form their character, that in it, apart from every sort of
oath, they should appear as true, and should proceed no farther than <i>&quot;yea</i><A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>&quot;<i>
</i>(yea), and should in their conversation truly apply this.
</p>
<p><b>22.</b> We<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> may ask therefore, whether there is any thing--whatever it
might be--against those who were the hearers of these things, and who forthwith
arose as teachers of them to other Disciples, (out) of which we may suppose they
fabricated all the things, which they attested their Master had done. And, What
is there in this leading us to suppose, that they all thoroughly lied ? They
were, in number, the Twelve who had been chosen, and the remaining Seventy of
whom it is said, that He sent them before Him, two and two, into every place and
part to which He was about to go. But, there is not so much as a word that can
be said of this whole company, (shewing) that they belied Him :--of men, who
loved the life that was pure, and the worship of the (true) God ; who cared but
little for all the children of their own families; and who instead of their
friends, their wives I say, their children and all belonging to them, took to
the life which had no possessions; and fully gave their testimony to their Lord, as from one
mouth, among all mankind.
</p>
<p><b>23.</b> This<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> is therefore, the leading, primary, and true reason. Let
us then, also investigate that which is opposed (to it). Let Him therefore be
(considered) the Teacher, and them the Disciples ; and so, as it were in a
relation of <A HREF="#305"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|305</SPAN></A> hypothesis that He taught none of the things already mentioned, but those
opposed to them (viz.); that they should forthwith be transgressors of the Law;
should act impiously, iniquitously, fraudulently, and falsely; should swear
falsely, and do (many) hateful things, and if there be any other vice that can
be named. Now, all these things are wholly foreign to the doctrines of our
Saviour; they are opposed (to them,) and would be the (offspring) of arrogance
and impudence. Nor, are they only opposed to His words and doctrines, but also
to the mode of life which has hitherto been delivered to all nations; that which
is practised in all His Churches. But, even if the matter be (wholly) false,
then cannot its like be advanced; (viz.) that we should have been a race so
negligent, as not even to have examined the things now before us!--Let Him then
be (supposed to have been) the Teacher of every vice, and iniquity; and that the
chief care was, that they should after all these things remain concealed. And
such custom is most wisely concealed under the form of a doctrine which is pure,
and putting forth a new (mode) of worship. These then, were led by such things,
and by others still worse. For vice previously ensnares, and it
constitutes the teaching of itself. They would (then,) exalt their Master to a
state of greatness by lying words, and spare not even one expression of
falsehood; and falsely ascribe to Him every sort of miracle and wonderful work,
that (men) might <A HREF="#306"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|306</SPAN></A> wonder at them and felicitate them, that they were dignified by being the
Disciples of such a Master.
</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Come then, let us now see,--if they really were such, --whether it was
possible that could have been established, which they endeavoured to do for Him.
For they say, that &quot;<i>Evil is friendly to evil, but not to good</i><A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>.&quot;<i>
</i>Whence then, is this agreement in vice to be discovered in the multitudes of
all these men ? And, Whence this testimony respecting them (viz.), that the
object of them all was in unison ? And, Whence this doctrine about the Divine
appointments, and the teaching of the (true) Philosophy ? Whence also, the mind
(intent) on the life of virtue ? And, Whence the doctrine (inculcating) flight
from every vice ? Whence also, the knowledge and recording of precepts such as
these ? And, Whence the glory of the conduct and conversation which was
delivered by them, throughout the whole creation of man ? Whence too, all this
power ? Whence this courage ? Whence this confidence ? Whence this resignation
even to death?--But, Who would at the first, even in opinion, have had respect
to the man who taught vice and bitterness,--as it is (here) said of Him,-- and
who promised such things ? They would surely say (such were the deeds) of a
Magician. But, the Disciples of this Leader were in nothing vicious. And, Must
not they have understood these things at the end of their Master ? and, by what
sort of Death he was affected ? Why then, after such an end of shame, did they
continue in these things ? and affirm of Him who was then among the dead, that
He was God, unless they thought it a thing of no moment, that they themselves
should suffer similar things ? Now, Who is it that has voluntarily and openly
ever chosen punishment for the sake of nothing profitable ? For, had they been
desirous of possessions, so would they also of <A HREF="#307"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|307</SPAN></A>
profit: and, if they had been abominable in character, they would have been
lustful. We may then think of them perhaps, that they had thus dealt with the
matter for the sake of these things, and intrepidly exposed<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
themselves even to death ! But, if they preached what was adverse to these, and
fully proclaimed (it) in the hearing of all the congregations (of Christians);
and also, immediately instructed (men) in the doctrine of the Scriptures, (viz.)
that they should flee from every vicious and base desire; should avoid every
thing fraudulent; should overcome every sort of lust, and the love of money; and
that they did moreover, so teach those who became their disciples; it will be
likely that they carried on no merchandize, collected no wealth, and took no
part in a life either of ease, or of pleasure. Since therefore, they were led by
none of these things; How could they have been induced to suffer, for no object,
the worst of punishments and of vengeance, for the testimony given of their
Master, which, again, had no foundation in fact? <A HREF="#308"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|308</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>25.</b> But let it be granted, that they honoured Him while He was yet with them,
and had His conversation among them, and led them astray by deception, as it has
been affirmed; How<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> was it then, that even after His death, and then
much more strenuously than before, they went on calling Him God ? Because, while
He was yet among men, it is said that they even forsook and denied Him, at the
time when His deceivers were ready (to take Him); but, after His departure from
among men, they joyfully chose death, rather than relinquish the good testimony
they had given respecting Him ! Those (Disciples) therefore, who formerly knew
no good thing of their Master, neither the life, deed, doctrine, nor work, that
was worthy of praise; and, who had received no advantage from Him, except indeed
vice, and the leading astray of men; How was it, that they so easily gave
themselves up to death, not, because they were in any respect guilty, but
because they had attested things so glorious and praise-worthy of Him; when
behold, it was in the power of every one of them to live in safety, and to lead
a life of comfort at home with his friends<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>? But, How could men, who
were themselves deceived and deceiving, submit willingly to death for another,
who, as they knew with certainty, (and) better than all others, had not been in
any one thing the cause of good to them, but--as men say,--the Teacher of every
evil ? A man endued with mind and virtue, may indeed for some noble conquest, or
for some excellent person, occasionally with propriety, and even with glory,
submit to death. But he, who is so base in character as to have been in pursuit
only of the things of a temporal life, and the enjoyment of lusts, has never
chosen death rather than life; nor has suffered severe punishment for the sake
of his friends, much less for one convicted of vice. How then, could the
Disciples of the (Person) mentioned,--who could not have been ignorant that He
was a deceiver and magician, if He really had been such, and even retaining in <A HREF="#309"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|309</SPAN></A>
themselves every vice that was hateful,--have willingly undergone every
species of torment and of punishment from their countrymen, on account of the
testimony they had given of Him ? But this is by no means, the disposition of
the vicious. For<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> I myself have seen many, who have faithfully kept
society and oath with the living; but who, as soon as these died, dissolved
every compact of this sort entered into between them. And we all know accurately
how the Sophists,--brought together in the cities (generally), and in glorious
repute for their erudition and display of words,--load with praises the
governors, and those vested with great power and rule, just so long as they
retain this; but, as soon as any change (in this respect) happens to them, these
also change their words; and no more will they willingly memorialize those whom
they formerly did, purely from the fear of those (now) in power.
</p>
<p><b>26.</b> If<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> then, these Disciples of our Saviour were deceived and
deceiving, I would add this also: They were unlearned, and altogether
illiterate; that is, they were even barbarians, and understood no language
except the Syriac. How then did they, after the departure of their Lord from
among men, go forth into the whole creation, and give their testimony to His
Godhead ? And, by What sort of advice were they prevailed on to attempt this ?
By What power too, did they effect that which they undertook? It might have
happened indeed, that some rustics at their own homes would be perverted and led
astray. But, that they (the Disciples) should be sent forth into foreign
countries, and should not relinquish their object through remissness, but should
preach the name of our Saviour to every man<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>, together with His deeds
of wonder; and not this only, but should also teach His commandments both in the
villages and cities;--some of them to the Roman power (itself), and (so)
apportion to themselves this city of the empire: others also, to the Persians;
others, to those among the Armenians; others, to the nation of the Parthians;
and again, to that also of the Scythians: (that) some of these <A HREF="#310"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|310</SPAN></A>
should go forth, even as far as the extremities of the creation, and arrive
at the country of the Hindoos; others pass over to the Islands beyond the ocean,
and which are called Britain;--could not, I think, have been the things of men;
How much less, of those who were deficient and illiterate? How much still less,
of deceivers and magicians?
</p>
<p><b>27.</b> How then could those, whose experience of their Master was, that He was
vicious and a perverter,-- and who had with their own eyes witnessed His
departure by death,--have used such terms with each other, for this (viz.), that
they should unanimously lie respecting Him ? For they all attested as with one
mouth, the cleansing of lepers, the casting out of Demons, the raising of the
dead, (the restoring of) sight to the blind, and many other instances of cure,
which were effected by Him :--
</p>
<p><b>28.</b> And after these things, His resurrection after the death which they had
previously witnessed? For, to such things, not happening, nor even being heard
of in their times, How could they, with one mouth, have given testimony, and
convinced (themselves) that they came to pass ? and have continued to place
faith in (this) their testimony, even to death ? Was it, either that they were
brought together, and that they swore to do this ? and that they entered into
compact with one another, to fabricate, and falsely to put forth, things which
never came to pass? And shall we say, that they used terms to this effect as the
pretence for such compact? or, such as these? Men, our friends!--Him who was,
(as it were) yesterday or the day before, a Deceiver and Teacher of error,--who
suffered extreme punishment before the eyes of us all,--we know better and more
accurately than any other, how far He excelled, because we were the Disciples of
His secret mysteries. He appeared as pure to the many, and thought that He
possessed something better than the many. But <A HREF="#311"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|311</SPAN></A>
He possessed nothing great, nor yet any thing worthy of (that) His
resurrection ; unless one might say, that He was cunning and impure in
character, and that those were perversions which He taught us, and the false
boastings which was favourable to such things;--come, let us give the right hand
to one another, and let us all at once enter into compact among ourselves, that
we will unanimously put forth, among all mankind, falsehood respecting Him, and
will say, that we saw &quot; <i>Him give sight to the blind,'' </i>a thing which
no one (of us) ever heard of; and that &quot; <i>He cleansed the lepers&quot; </i>and
<i>&quot;Raised the dead.&quot; </i>And we will in a body affirm, that things
were done by Him which we (indeed) never saw; and were said (by Him) which we
likewise never heard. Those things too which were done, as it were in reality,
we will contend for (as such). And, if this His last end has been published, and
He so openly received His death that no one can conceal it, we will
nevertheless, impudently make this of no effect; attesting pertinaciously that
He rose from the dead; was also with all of us, and accompanied us both in
conversation and in the usual meals. Let this then, be pertinaciously and
shamelessly retained in all these things, and so remain with us, that we persist
in it even to death !--For, Why might we (not) expose ourselves to death for
nothing<sup>7</sup> ? And, Why should it molest us, willingly to receive stripes
and torments in our persons, for nothing that is necessary ? And, if it be
required that we should suffer imprisonment, injury, and affliction, for nothing
that is true; should submit instantaneously to this; should all of us together
lie by consent, and put forth falsehood for no profit whatever, either to
ourselves or to those who may be deceived by us; or, to Him, of whom these lies
have been told by us; affirming that He was God: and that we should extend this
falsehood, not only to our own people, but should also go out among all mankind,
and fill the whole creation with the <A HREF="#312"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|312</SPAN></A>
things we have (thus) laid down respecting Him; and should thence proceed
forthwith, to make laws for all nations, subversive of the opinions respecting
the Gods of their forefathers; those (I say), which had from ancient times been
established among them : and, that we should first of all lay our commands upon
the Romans, not to worship those whom their forefathers supposed to be Gods;
that we should then also pass off<i> </i>to the Greeks, and preach that which is
also adverse to their wise men : that we should not neglect the Egyptians, but
contend also with their Deities, but should not draw out against them the things
of Moses, which were in former times adverse to them, but place against them the
Death of our Teacher as something terrific: and should destroy that fame
respecting the Gods, which formerly went out from among them to all mankind, not
by mere words, and stories, but by the power of our Lord, of Him who was
crucified; and, that we should again proceed even to the extremities of the land
of the Barbarians, and subvert the things (prevailing) with all men: and for
this purpose not one of us should be wanting : For the reward pertaining to the
things which we (so) attempted, would not be small, since the triumphs<sup> </sup>to
which we should present ourselves, would not be simple ones; but, as it is
likely, (would be) punishments awarded by the laws of every place; open bonds,
torments, imprisonments, fire, sword, (death by) the cross and (by) wild beasts:
but, because we would acquire a likeness to our Teacher, we would willingly
rather, and with joyfulness one and all, continue (partaking) in these
calamities! For, What can there be better than this, that we should be found
enemies to both God and man, for no one thing profitable ? And also, that we
should obtain nothing of ease ? neither should see our friends, nor in any way
increase our wealth ? nor even possess the hope of any good to perfection ? but
should, on the contrary, vainly and without any object err <A HREF="#313"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|313</SPAN></A>
ourselves, and lead others (also) astray ? For this is the helpful thing (had
in view), that we should both be opposed to all nations, and also engaged in
contention with those Gods, whom all men have from ancient times confessed: and,
that we should preach of Him who was our Teacher, and who died before our eyes,
that He was God, and the Son of God : and that we ourselves should be ready to
die for Him, having learned from him nothing true, and nothing advantageous! And
that we should particularly honour Him, because He aided us in nothing
excellent: and should moreover do every thing in order to glorify His name;
suffer every sort of injury and vengeance, and willingly receive every form of
punishment for nothing that is true! For, evil certainly is truth, and falsehood
has that which is opposed to vice. On this account we say, that &quot;<i>He even
raised the dead, also cleansed the lepers, also cast out Demons, and was the
doer of other wonderful works</i>,&quot;<i> </i>when we know of no such things
done by Him, but have fabricated all these things for ourselves; and (thus) led
all astray, on whom we could prevail to do so ! But, if any one would not be
(so) persuaded, still we ourselves should,-- for the sake of the things which we
had (so) bargained upon among ourselves,--have brought forth upon ourselves the
things worthy of such a system of error.
</p>
<p><b>29.</b> And Do these things appear to you as convincing ? And, Can you so far
persuade yourself, that they (His Disciples) did falsely put forth such things
as these ? And, that men so deficient and unlettered, did actually make (such)
compact among themselves, and (triumphantly) walk over the power of the Romans ?
Could human nature, possessed as it is with the love of life, have ever
submitted, for no object and of its own will, to death ? Or, Could the Disciples
of our Saviour have been carried on to such an excess of madness, that they
should at once,--when they had seen no act of a miraculous character performed
by Him, --have falsely put forth by compact such things as these? <A HREF="#314"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|314</SPAN></A>
And again, Could they have put together such lying statements respecting Him,
and then have readily submitted to death in support of them?
</p>
<p><b>30.</b> But they went not forth by compact, to this (work of) preaching
respecting Him; nor did they make (any compact) among themselves. Whence then,
had they this perfect agreement of testimony respecting His deeds ? Is it (not)
likely, from seeing the things which were done by Him ?--For one of (these) two
things must be the fact: (viz.) Either, they made compact among themselves, and
lied; or else, they attested (what) they had seen with their eyes. If then, they
really saw (the things), and preached (them) to all men; they were worthy of
credit when they said of our Saviour, that He was God; and, that He permitted
them to see with their eyes, (the putting forth of) Divine powers, Miracles, and
wonderful Works. If however they really saw none of the things (so) recorded,
but put together false statements; and accordingly made oath, and sworn
covenant, on this, (viz.) that they would say nothing true, and (then) lied, and
attested of their Lord what was false; How could they in reality have submitted
to death, for nothing true ? and, that neither fire, nor sword, nor fierce
beasts, nor the depth of the sea, could make them falsify the accounts, which
they had (thus) falsely put forth respecting their Lord ?
</p>
<p><b>31.</b> But, How can you say that they neither expected nor hoped, that they
should suffer any calamity from this their testimony respecting Him; and, that
they therefore went out, even boldly, to the (work of) preaching about Him ? On
the contrary, it was impossible they should not have hoped, that they should
suffer every sort of calamity: superinducing as they did the destruction of the
Gods, at once of the Romans, the Greeks, and the Barbarians. Now the Book
itself, which (speaks) of them, shews plainly, that after the death of their
Lord certain men, enemies of the word and who lay in wait for it, laid hands on
them; delivering them first to imprisonment, and then strictly <A HREF="#315"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|315</SPAN></A>
commanding them, that they should speak to none in the name of Jesus<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>.
And, when they found them afterwards openly teaching the multitudes the things
respecting Him, they violently seized, and scourged (them), and forbade them
(so) to teach ; Simon Peter answering said to them, &quot;<i>It is right that we
should rather hearken to God, and not to men</i><A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>.&quot;<i> </i>After
these things too, Stephen was stoned with stones, and died; because he had
openly spoken (of Him) in the assembly of the Jews<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>. And there arose
no small persecution<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> against those, who were the ambassadors of the
name of Jesus. And again at another time, when Herod the king of the Jews slew
James the brother of John with the sword, he, the same, confined Simon Peter in
bonds, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>. And, while
these suffered such things, the rest of the Disciples persevered, grew strong,
and remained in the doctrine of our Saviour ; and again preached to all men more
particularly respecting Him, and His wonderful works. After these things, James--whom
those who formerly resided at Jerusalem called <i>&quot;the Just&quot; </i>on
account of his great excellence,--was interrogated of the chief priests and
doctors of the Jewish people, as to what he thought of Jesus; and, when he
returned answer to them, that &quot; <i>He was the Son of </i>God<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>,&quot;
he was also stoned with stones by them<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>. Simon Peter too, was, after
his<A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A> Head (i.e. Christ), crucified at Rome. Paul also was taken off<A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
(slain,) and John was committed to the island (Patmos in banishment). And, while
these suffered such things, not so much as one of the <A HREF="#316"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|316</SPAN></A>
rest forsook His (Christ's) doctrine; and (indeed) all of them prayed, that
such things might befall them, in order that they might, for the sake of the
worship of God, be like to those already mentioned. And, on this account again,
they openly gave their testimony of our Saviour, and of His wonderful works, the
more abundantly.
</p>
<p><b>32. </b> And observe, If the things which they preached respecting Him were lies,
and they had fabricated them by compact; we ought to wonder how this whole
company could have observed this agreement, in what they had fabricated, even to
death. And no one of them ever betrayed any fear, on account of the things that
had happened to those who had previously been slain; or left their society; or
preached that which opposed what his companion had; or brought to light the
things they had (so) agreed upon. But even he, who,--filled with the love of
money,--dared to deliver Him up to (His) enemies, did forthwith, and with his
own hands, inflict punishment on himself<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A> !
</p>
<p><b>33.</b> Now, Is not this replete with wonder, that men, who were deceivers and
unlettered<A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>, knowing neither how to speak, or understand, any
language beyond that of their fathers, should not only undertake to go forth and
to pass into all nations, but should also (so) go forth and effect (their)
purpose ? And, let this also be considered, that not even one of them ever
uttered a word adverse to the marvellous deeds of their Lord ! If then, the
agreement of witnesses is sufficient to settle any of those things, about which
there is doubt, and which is commonly brought into dispute in the courts of law;--and
the law of God has declared that<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> &quot;<i>in the mouth of two or
three witnesses, every matter shall be established</i><A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A><i>,&quot;--</i>Shall
not the truth also be established by these, who were the chosen twelve, and <A HREF="#317"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|317</SPAN></A>
the Disciples seventy in number, and thousands of others besides these, all
of whom at once exhibited (so) wonderful an agreement, and who have (so) given
their testimony to the things done by our Saviour ? This too they did, not
without affliction<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>; but in the suffering of torments, and of every
species of injury, of scourgings, imprisonment, and deaths! On this account they
were through God believed, in order that (He) might everywhere confirm the word
preached, by their means, throughout the whole habitable world, even to this day
!
</p>
<p><b>34.</b> Let<A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A> it be considered then, that we have granted these things,
by connivance at an unjust principle. For (in) this, that a man might imagine
that which is adverse to the Scripture, and, that we should say of the common
Saviour of all that He was a Teacher, not of righteous precepts, but of those of
vice, fraud, and of every sort of abomination; and, that these His Disciples
learned the same from Him, and were all lustful and vicious in every thing,
beyond all men that ever existed; we allowed, by connivance, according to the
statement (supposed), that which is of all things the most improper. For this
would be, as if one should in a similar manner, injuriously accuse Moses who
said in the law, &quot;<i>Thou shalt, not kill; neither shalt thou commit
adultery ; neither shalt thou steal</i>; <i>neither shalt thou bear false
witness</i>;&quot;<i> </i>and should say, that he uttered these things by way of
irony and in hypocrisy; for, it was his wish (nevertheless) that his hearers
should kill, commit adultery, <A HREF="#318"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|318</SPAN></A> and act in direct opposition to the things, which he himself shewed the Law
laid down; and put forth (merely) the form of an approach to purity of life!--But
there is nothing so shameless as this ! In like manner also, might any one
arraign the positions<A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A> of the Philosophers among the Greeks, whose
lives were those of patience, as were all their words, and might say, that they
were in their conduct opposed to what they wrote; and so shewed themselves to
have made a mere (hypocritical) approach to the life, which belongs to
philosophy. And thus, we affirm, might any one simply arraign all the writings
of the ancients, and shew cause against the truth which they contain; and might
Himself receive that, which is diametrically opposed to these! But, as it cannot
be difficult to any one possessed of common sense, to pronounce of this that it
would be madness; so also, of the precepts of our Saviour and of His Disciples,
should any one pervert the truth which is (found) in these, and then attempt to
fix upon Him the things diametrically opposed to His teaching.-- But, let that
be granted which the statement itself requires. How much more will it then
appear, that the assertion of the opponent cannot stand, as (being grounded) in
a connivance (concession) which it is improper to (allow) ?
</p>
<p><b>35.</b> These<A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A> things being then refuted, let us also consider the
testimony of the Scriptures of the Divinity, and the spotless and truth-loving
manner of the Disciples, of our Saviour. Any one therefore, who chooses (to
exercise) a sound mind, may hence see, that they were worthy of all dignity,
since they confessed that they were mean and unlettered in their discourse, and
betook themselves to a love for the doctrine of the worship of God, and of
philosophy. They also desired the life, capable of submitting to sufferings, and
afflicted by fasting, (by) abstinence from wine and from flesh, and (by) many
other humiliating things of the body; by prayer and supplication to God, and
more particularly by temperance, and the chief holiness of body. <A HREF="#319"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|319</SPAN></A>
and soul<sup>3</sup>. And, Who is not astonished at this, that they should,
for the sake of the excellency of wisdom, have even separated themselves from
the wives that had been lawfully given to them ? and that they were led by no
natural desire, and subdued by no love of children; since they desired not the
children that were mortal, but those which were immortal ? And, How can any one
fail to wonder at this their character, that they desired no money ? or (How)
imagine this, that they fled not from, but loved, a Teacher who despised the
possessions of gold and silver ? and the Lawgiver, who laid it down that they
should not enlarge their possessions even to two coats<A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>? which any
one hearing, would doubtless seek excuse from its severe requirements; while
they were seen to act upon it, even to the letter ! For, upon a certain occasion
a lame man--one of those who begged, on account of the extreme doubt as to
provision,--asked (alms) of those who were about Simon Peter: and, when Simon
Peter had nothing that he could give, he confessed that he was destitute (lit.
clean) of every sort of possession of silver and gold, and said, &quot;<i>Silver
and gold have I none</i><A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>.&quot;<i> </i>After this he brought forth
the precious name,--which is of all things the most precious,--and said, &quot;<i>This
which I have give I to thee. In the name of Jesus the Christ, arise and walk</i>.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>36.</b> And<A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>, when they attended to their Teacher, (Jesus) enjoined
upon them the grievous things, (which should happen to them) in these words
which He said to them, (viz.) &quot;<i>In the world ye shall have tribulation</i><A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>;&quot;<i>
</i>and again--&quot; <i>Ye shall weep and mourn, but the world shall</i> <A HREF="#320"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|320</SPAN></A>
<i>rejoice</i><A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>,&quot; How plainly did the firmness and deep
(sincerity) of their character not appear, since they fled not from these
(severe) exercises of the soul, nor betook themselves to the things of the
desires ? nor did their Lord moreover allure them by way of deception, or make
them His by promising them the things which supply ease and comfort; but, truly
and freely foretold to them those which should happen to them; and enabled them
to choose for themselves the sort of conduct, which He had laid down for them.
Of this sort were the things, which He foretold and attested, respecting the
persecutions that were to happen to them, because of His name, (viz.) &quot;<i>that
they should come before governours, and even kings</i><A HREF="#65"><SUP>65</SUP></A>;&quot;<i> </i>and,
that they should suffer every sort of punishment and vengeance, not on account
of any thing hateful, nor for any other just cause ; but for this only, (viz.),
for their testimony respecting Him; which (indeed), we have seen with our own
eyes, has happened even to this time ? His prediction moreover, is worthy of our
admiration ; for the testimony (given) respecting the name of our Saviour, and
the confessing of Him, had usually the effect of inflaming the anger of the
Rulers. And, even if nothing hateful had been perpetrated by any one confessing
Christ, they punished and injuriously treated him, on account of His name, as
evil, and more evil than any other thing: but, if any one did not confess His
name, but denied that he was a Disciple of Christ, he was immediately set at
liberty, even if he were implicated in many things which were abominable! But,
What necessity can there be, that I should collect and endeavour to record, the
many things relating to the lives of the Disciples of our Saviour, when the
things already advanced, will be sufficient proof of (all) that is before us ?
To these (however) we will again add the things (following), here in (their)
place; and with these we will conclude our discussion.
</p>
<p><b>37.</b> As to Matthew the Apostle<A HREF="#66"><SUP>66</SUP></A> his former manner
<A HREF="#321"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|321</SPAN></A> of life was not that which was excellent; on the contrary, he was one of
those whose business was tax-gathering and fraud. This however, not one of the
rest of the Apostles has laid open to us, neither John the Apostle who was with
him, nor Luke, nor Mark, the writers of the rest of the Gospels: but Matthew,
recording his own manner of life, has become his own accuser ! Hear then, how
openly he has memorialized his own name against himself in his own writing, and
has thus spoken :--
</p>
<p><b>38.</b> &quot;<A HREF="#67"><SUP>67</SUP></A><i>And, when Jesus passed from thence, He saw a man
sitting among the Tax-gatherers, whose name was Matthew; and He said to him,
Follow me: and he arose (and) followed Him. And it came to pass that when He was
sitting in the house, Behold many Tax-gatherers and Sinners were sitting with
Jesus, and with His Disciples.&quot; </i>And again, after these things, when
passing away, and reciting the number of the rest of the Disciples, He added
respecting Himself the name of Tax-gatherer, and spoke thus: &quot;<i>The</i><A HREF="#68"><SUP>68</SUP></A><i>
names of the twelve Apostles are these: The first, Simon who is called Cephas,
and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, Philip
and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew the Tax-gatherer.&quot; </i>Thus
therefore Matthew evinces, through the greatness of (his) humility, his
truth-loving character, calls himself a Tax-gatherer; conceals not his former
mode of life, and counts himself among sinners ! He also numbers himself second
to the Apostle who was with him; for he associated (himself) with Thomas, as (he
did) Simon with Andrew, James with John, and Philip with Bartholomew ; placing
Thomas first, and honouring him as the more excellent Apostle with himself;
while the rest of the Evangelists have done the reverse of this<A HREF="#69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>.
Hear therefore how Luke <A HREF="#322"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|322</SPAN></A> bears record of Matthew, not giving him the appellation of Tax-gatherer, nor
placing him after Thomas; but, because he considered him the more worthy,
numbering him first, and placing Thomas after him, just as Mark has done: His
words then, are these: <i>&quot;And</i><A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A>,<i> when it was day, He
called His Disciples, and chose twelve out of them, those whom He named
Apostles: Simon, whom He named Cephas; and </i><A HREF="#323"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|323</SPAN></A>
<i>Andrew his brother</i><sup>2</sup><i>, James and John, and Philip and
Bartholomew, and Matthew and Thomas.&quot; </i>Thus therefore Luke honoured
Matthew, just as they, who had from the first been eye-witnesses and hearers of
the word, had delivered to him<A HREF="#71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>. <A HREF="#72"><SUP>72</SUP></A>And thus Matthew,
through his humility, made little of himself, confessed that he was a
Tax-gatherer, and numbered himself the second (in order), after the Apostle who
was (named) with him.
</p>
<p><b>39.</b> You<A HREF="#73"><SUP>73</SUP></A> will also find that John is like Matthew (in this
respect) ; for in his Epistle<A HREF="#74"><SUP>74</SUP></A> he does not so much as make mention of
himself, or call himself Elder<A HREF="#75"><SUP>75</SUP></A> or Apostle, or Evangelist. In the
Gospel too, which was written by him, he says of himself that Jesus loved him,
but he does not reveal his own name.
</p>
<p><b>40.</b> Simon Peter moreover, did not so much as attempt the writing of a Gospel,
on account of his great fear (of responsibility). But Mark, they say, who, being
well known to him and his Disciple, put on record the declarations of Simon
respecting the deeds of our Saviour. Who,--when <A HREF="#324"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|324</SPAN></A>
he betook himself to the recording of these things, (viz.) when Jesus asked
what men said of Him, and the Disciples themselves what they thought of Him;
Simon answered and said to Him, &quot;<i>Thou</i><A HREF="#76"><SUP>76</SUP></A><i> art the Christ</i>;&quot;--made
the statement that Jesus did not even answer him, or say any thing to him; but
that He forbade their telling this to any man. Now Mark committed these things
to writing, although he was not present with Jesus when He said them; but he had
heard them from Peter, when he taught them. Peter however, was unwilling to
state the things which Jesus had said either to him, or about him, by way of
testimony (favourable) to himself. But, the things which were said of him are
these, (which) Matthew has put forth in these (words): &quot;<i>But</i><A HREF="#77"><SUP>77</SUP></A><i>
you, Whom say ye that I am ? Simon said to Him, Thou art the Christ the Son of
the living God. And Jesus answered and said to him; Blessed art thou Simon son
of Jonas, since flesh and blood have not revealed (this) to thee, but my Father
who is in heaven. And I also say to thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this
rock</i><A HREF="#78"><SUP>78</SUP></A><i> will I build my Church, and the gate-bars of hell shall not
prevail against it. And I give to thee the keys</i><A HREF="#79"><SUP>79</SUP></A> <i>of the
kingdom of heaven; and every one whom thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound
in heaven; and every one whom thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in
heaven&quot; </i>When (therefore), all these things were said to Simon Peter by
Jesus, Mark did not record so much as <A HREF="#325"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|325</SPAN></A>
one of them ; because, as it is probable, neither did Peter mention them in
his teaching<A HREF="#80"><SUP>80</SUP></A>. These things therefore, Simon Peter well kept silent,
and thence Mark omitted them. But the things of his denial (of Christ), he
preached to all men; and (so) caused an accusation to be recorded against
himself! That he wept bitterly too, over this, you will find Mark to have given
the record in these (words): &quot;<i>And</i><A HREF="#81"><SUP>81</SUP></A>,<i> when Peter was in
the court, one of the maid-servants of the High Priest came to him; and, when
she saw that he was warming (himself), she looked upon him and said to him, Thou
also wast with Jesus the Nazarene. But he denied and said, I know (him) not, nor
do I perceive what thou sayest: and he went out into the outer court; and the
cock crew. And again a maid saw him, and began to say to those who were standing
(by) ;</i> <A HREF="#326"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|326</SPAN></A> <i>This (man) also is (one) of them. And he again denied. And again a little
after, those who were standing (by) said to Simon, Truly thou art (one) of them;
for thou art also a Galilean. But he began to curse and to say, I know not this
man of whom ye speak. And immediately, the cock crew the second time&quot; </i>These
things Mark wrote; and these, Simon Peter witnessed against himself. For all
these things of Mark are, they say, the memorials of the declarations of Peter
himself<A HREF="#82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p><b>41.</b> Of<A HREF="#83"><SUP>83</SUP></A> those therefore, who excused themselves from saying the
things which would contribute to their own good fame, and who recorded against
themselves accusations which can never be forgotten, charging themselves with
their own foolishness, in things which none of those who came afterwards could
have known, had they not been recorded by themselves; How (shall we not assert)
they were free from every feeling of self-love, and lying statement ? and justly
confess of them, that they openly and clearly put forth the proof of an ardent
love of truth? Those therefore, who evinced such a character as this,--of whom
men thought that they were the authors of falsehood and of lying, and whom they
endeavoured to malign as Deceivers ;--How are these not (now) found to be a
laughing-stock, lovers of hatred and envy, and enemies to the truth ? For, How
should not those be such, who (insisted) on the things which were guileless, and
of no hateful observance; these same (I say), whose characters were true and
pure, and who shewed forth their habitual dispositions by their words ?--(not)
that (men) should say of them, that they were cunning and wily Sophists, and
fabricators of things that had no existence, and laid upon their Lord, by way of
favour, things which He never did. It does appear to me, that we may well put
the question to these, Whether<A HREF="#84"><SUP>84</SUP></A> it be right we should give credence
to the Disciples of our Saviour, or not ? And, if we are not <A HREF="#327"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|327</SPAN></A>
to give credence to these only, Whether we should to all those also, who have
long ago preached the memorial of their conduct and precepts, (both) among the
Greeks and the Barbarians; and have committed to writing time after time the
victories attending this ? And also, Whether it be just to extend credence to
others; but to withhold it from them only?--How clearly then, does not the
malice of such (opponents) appear!
</p>
<p><b>42.</b> But<A HREF="#85"><SUP>85</SUP></A>, Why should these have lied respecting their Lord ? and
have delivered down, in their writings, things of Him which had no existence, as
if they had really happened ? Why too, should they have falsely stated of Him
the sufferings, and (other) grievous things (which He bore) ? His betrayal by
one word of His Disciple (Judas) ? the accusation of those who criminated Him ?
the ridicule ? the contempt of the judgment (passed on Him) ? the reproach ? the
smitings on the face ? the scourges laid upon His loins ? the crown of thorns
which was placed upon Him in reproach ? the purple robe which they put upon Him
after the manner of a cloke ? and, at last, the bearing of His cross, the signal
mark of His victory ? that He was then affixed to this? that He was pierced both
in His hands and feet ? that they gave Him vinegar to drink ? that one struck
Him on the head with a reed ? that He was derided of those who looked on Him ?
Is it right (I say), that we should suppose His Disciples to have falsely stated
even these, and many other similar things that are written about Him ? Or, that
we should believe they truly stated these (disreputable) things ? but, that we
should not give credence to those which are honourable (to Him)? But, How can
this system of contrariety be supported ? <A HREF="#328"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|328</SPAN></A>
For this, that (men) should affirm that these same persons were true; and
again this, that they were false, would be nothing else but to affirm of them,
that which is in itself contradictory ! Of What sort then, should the
reprehension of these be ? For, if this stigma is to be fixed upon them, (viz.)
that they propagated falsehood, and exalted their Lord by lying statements, and
adorned Him by means of (fabricated) miracles; they surely never would have
committed to writing the things already mentioned, which were adverse to
themselves; nor would they have made it known to those, who should come
afterwards, that He, whose ambassadors they were, was &quot;<i>oppressed </i>and
&quot; <i>exceedingly sorrowful&quot; </i>and was <i>perturbed in his soul: </i>or,
that they <i>&quot;forsook Him and fled-&quot; </i>or, that he, who was the
chosen of all the Apostles, and His Disciple, the same Simon Peter (I say),--who
is preached of,--did, without either pain (inflicted), or torment threatened,
deny Him three times! For these things, even if said by others, it was necessary
they should deny; they (I say), who betook themselves to nothing else, except
the fabrication of false statements favourable to Him, and magnifying both
themselves and their Lord.
</p>
<p><b>43.</b> If<A HREF="#86"><SUP>86</SUP></A> then, they appear to be lovers of truth in those grievous
accounts (which they give) of Him ; much more are they so in those glorious
ones. For those, who chose to lie on any one occasion, would the more
particularly avoid those things which brought difficulty with them, either by
silence or denial of them : because, those who should come after, would not have
it in their power to blame the things, which they had (so) kept silent. Why
then, did they not lie and say that Judas who betrayed Him, forthwith became a
stone, when he dared to give the kiss--the signal of betrayal? And, that he who
dared to strike Him on the cheek, had his right hand immediately withered ? And
the High Priest of the Jews, because he ran along with those who criminated Him,
became blind in his eyes? But, Why did not they all lie, (and say) that, in <A HREF="#329"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|329</SPAN></A>
truth, no grievance (whatsoever) happened to Him ? but, that He concealed
Himself from men, and laughed at their judgment-hall? and, that those who
accused Him, were deceived by spectres sent from God ; thinking that they were
doing something adverse to one who was not near them ? And, Why should not this
have been (deemed) more glorious, than their falsely stating that &quot;<i>He
raised the dead,&quot; </i>and was <i>the doer of wonderful works ? </i>This,
that they should have recorded, that nothing either human or mortal happened to
him; but, that He did every thing by the Divine power ?--That He made His
ascension to heaven in the Divine glory ? For those, who gave credence to their
other accounts, could not have with-holden their belief from these. How then,
should those be (deemed) worthy of exemption from every suspicion of vice, who
concealed nothing of the truth, as to the difficulties and calamities (so
happening); and not also worthy of all credit, as to the other miraculous deeds
which they attested respecting Him ? The testimony therefore, of these men
respecting our Saviour, is sufficient. There is nevertheless, nothing to
prohibit our availing ourselves, even the more abundantly, of the Hebrew witness
Josephus; who, in the Eighteenth Book of his Antiquities of the Jews, writing
the things that belonged to the times of Pilate, commemorates our Saviour in
these words: --
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>(The testimony) of Josephus respecting the Christ.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>44.</b> &quot; At<A HREF="#87"><SUP>87</SUP></A> this period then was Jesus, a wise man, if it be
right to call Him a man; for He was the doer of <A HREF="#330"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|330</SPAN></A>
wonderful works, and the Teacher of those men who, with pleasure, received
Him in truth. And He brought together many (both) of the Jews, and many of the
profane (Gentiles). And this was the Messiah (Christ). And, when Pilate, at the
suggestion of the principal ancient men among ourselves, laid on Him the
punishment of the Cross, those who formerly loved Him were not reduced to
silence. For He appeared again to them, on the third day, alive: things which,
with many others, the Prophets had said respecting Him : so that from thence,
and even until now, the race of the Christians has not been wanting to
Him.&quot;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b> 45.</b> If<A HREF="#88"><SUP>88</SUP></A> therefore, as (this) author attests of Him,
<A HREF="#331"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|331</SPAN></A> He was the doer of wonderful works, and that He made His Disciples,--not only
the twelve Apostles, or the seventy Disciples, but also attached to Himself,--myriads
of others both of the Jews and Gentiles; it is clear, that He possessed
something excellent beyond the rest of mankind. For, How could He have otherwise
attached to Himself the many, both of the Jews and Gentiles, unless He had made
use of miracles and astonishing deeds, and of doctrines (till then) unknown ?
The Book of the Acts of the Apostles also attests, that there were many
thousands of the Jews, who were persuaded that He was that Christ of God, who
had been preached of by the Prophets. It is also on record, that there was a
great Church of Christ at Jerusalem; which had been collected from among the
Jews, even to the times of its reduction by Hadrian. The first Bishops too who
were there, are said to have been, one after another, fifteen (in number), who
were Jews<A HREF="#89"><SUP>89</SUP></A>; the names of whom are published to the men of that place,
even until now. So that by these, every accusation against the Disciples may be
undone; since, what was prior to them, and independent of their testimony, these
attest of Him, (viz.), that He, the Christ of God, did by means of these
wondrous works which He performed, reduce many, both of the Jews and of the
Gentiles, beneath His power<A HREF="#90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p><b>46.</b> You<A HREF="#91"><SUP>91</SUP></A> will also be made acquainted with the Divinity of His
power, if you will consider of what nature He was; and how it was that all this
superiority of the Divine power (operated) in the overcoming of tilings
exceeding all description. For let it be considered, No one--who ever wished to
disseminate his laws, or any strange doctrine among all nations, and, who would
shew himself to be a Teacher of the worship of the one supreme God, to all races
of men,--would be willing to make use of those as the ministers of his will, who
were of all men the most rustic and deficient. And it is likely, one might <A HREF="#332"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|332</SPAN></A>
think, he would attempt this with the greatest impropriety. For, How could
they who could scarcely open<sup> </sup>their lips, ever be the Teachers of any
one man, much less of multitudes ? And, How could they,--destitute of every sort
of erudition,--address whole assemblies, unless this were indeed a shewing forth
of the will of God ? For He called them, as we have already shewn, and said in
the first place &quot;<i>Follow me, and I will make you Fishers of </i>men<A HREF="#92"><SUP>92</SUP></A>.&quot;
And, because He thenceforth made them His own, and they adhered to Him, He
breathed into them the Divine power<A HREF="#93"><SUP>93</SUP></A>, and filled them both with
strength and courage: and, as He was THE WORD or GOD in truth, and the Doer of
all these miracles, He made them the Fishermen of intellectual and reasonable
souls; adding, at once to the word <i>&quot;Follow me, and I will make you&quot;
</i>the Deed, making them both the Doers, and Teachers, of the worship of His
God<A HREF="#94"><SUP>94</SUP></A>. And thus He sent them forth into all nations throughout the
whole creation, and demonstrated that they were the Preachers of His doctrine.
And, Who is not astonished, and probably incredulous, as to this miracle,--
which could scarcely (indeed) have been imagined ? Since no one, of those who
have been eminent, has ever been commemorated as having had recourse to any such
thing as this; or has come up to any thing resembling it<A HREF="#95"><SUP>95</SUP></A>. For it has
been the desire of each one of these, to set up something promising to himself,
in his own land only; or, to be able to establish such laws as seemed to him
good, among some one people of his own. But observe of Him, who availed himself
of nothing either human or mortal, how, in reality, He again put forth the word
of God in the precept, which He gave <A HREF="#333"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|333</SPAN></A>
to these His powerless Disciples, (viz.) &quot;<i>Go ye and make Disciples of
all nations</i><A HREF="#96"><SUP>96</SUP></A><i>!&quot; </i>It is likely too, His Disciples would
thus address their Lord, by way of answer: How can we do this ? For, How can we
preach to the Romans ? And, How can we discourse with the Egyptians? What
diction can we use against the Greeks; being brought up in the Syrian language
only ? How can we persuade the Persians, the Armenians, the Chaldeans, the
Scythians, the Hindoos, and other nations called Barbarians, to desert the gods
of their forefathers, and to worship the one Creator of all things? And, upon
What superiority of words can we rely, that we shall succeed in this ? Or. How
can we hope, that we shall prevail in the things attempted ? (viz.) that we
shall legislate for all nations, in direct opposition to the laws laid down from
ancient times, (and this) against their gods ? And, What power have we upon
which to trust, that we shall succeed in this enterprise ? These things
therefore, the Disciples of our Saviour would either have thought, or said. But
He who was their Lord solved, by one additional word, the aggregate of the
things of which they doubted, (and) pledged them by saying, '' <i>Ye shall
conquer in my name</i>.&quot;<i> </i>For it was not that He commanded them,
simply and indiscriminately, to go and make Disciples of all nations; but with
this excellent addition which He delivered, (viz): &quot;<i>In my name.&quot; </i>Since
it was by the power of His name that all this came to pass ; as the Apostle has
said, &quot;<i>God has given Him a name, which is superior to every name: that,
at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow which is in heaven, and which is in
earth, and which is beneath the earth.&quot; </i>It is likely therefore, that He
would shew forth the excellency of the unseen power, which was <A HREF="#334"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|334</SPAN></A>
hidden from the many, by <i>His name; </i>and, (accordingly) He made the
addition, <i>&quot;In my name.&quot; </i>He thus accurately foretold moreover,
something which should come to pass, (when) He said, &quot;<i>It is expedient
that this my Gospel be preached in the whole world, for the testimony of all
nations</i><A HREF="#97"><SUP>97</SUP></A>.&quot; Now, this matter was then declared in a corner of
the earth, so that those only who were at hand could have heard it. But, How
could they have believed Him when He said this, unless they had taken experiment
as to the truth of His words, from the other Divine acts which were done by Him
? For this, you are compelled to confess when it is considered, that they gave
credence to what He said. For, when He gave them the command, not so much as one
sought to be excused; but they confided in what He had intimated : and, just as
His promises had been, so DID they make Disciples of the whole race of men !
They did go forth from their own land into all nations ; and, in a short time,
His words were seen in effect! His Gospel was therefore shortly preached,
throughout the whole creation, for the testimony of all nations, so that the
Barbarians and Greeks received the Scriptures, respecting the common Saviour of
all, in the handwriting of their Progenitors, and in the words of their
spiritual Fathers.
</p>
<p><b>47.</b> A man might therefore well stand in doubt, as to what the form of the
doctrine of our Saviour's Disciples was; how they passed on into the midst of
cities, and so proclaimed (it) in the middle of the streets; lifting up their
voices, calling to those with whom they met, and thence conversing with the
people: also, of what sort the language was in which they addressed them, so
that we can imagine the hearers were persuaded thereby: and (again), how (such)
men, inexperienced in words and far removed from every sort of erudition, could
speak before the people ; and (this), if not in large assemblies, still with the
few with <A HREF="#335"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|335</SPAN></A> whom they met, and then addressed: and, of what, and of what sort of terms,
they made use for persuading (their) hearers. Nor was their effort
small, since they by no means denied the ignominious death of Him, whom they
preached. But, even if they concealed this, and did not confess before all,
what, and how many, things He suffered of the Jews, but put forth only those
splendid and glorious things--I say indeed,--His wondrous works, His miraculous
operations, and His doctrines of the (true) Philosophy; still, the matter will
not thus be made easy, (viz.) how they could make those who heard them, easily
to give in to their declarations: because their diction would be foreign. They
would too, now be listening to declarations entirely new, (coming) from men, who
possessed nothing worthy of truth, in testimony of the things affirmed by them.
</p>
<p><b>48.</b> But<A HREF="#98"><SUP>98</SUP></A>, let it be supposed that the persuasives now put forth
were these, (viz.) that those who were His ambassadors, should at one time
preach that He was God ; that, in body, He was human ; and that, in his nature,
He was no other than THE WORD OF GOD: on which account also, He performed all
these miracles, and (put forth these) powers: but, that at another time, He
suffered reproach and infamy, and at last the capital and shameful punishment of
the Cross; which is inflicted on those (only), who are in their deeds the worst
of all men. Who then, would not (now) properly treat them with ridicule, as
affirming things opposed to each other ? And, Who is he, whose intellect would
(partake) so much of stone, as readily to believe them, when they said that they
saw Him<i> </i>after His death ? that He rose from the dead?--Him (I say), who
could not help Himself when among the living<A HREF="#99"><SUP>99</SUP></A>? And (again), Who would
ever be persuaded by men so illiterate and <A HREF="#336"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|336</SPAN></A>
deficient as these, when saying; You should despise the things of your own
forefathers; charge as folly those of the wise of ancient times; suffer
yourselves to be persuaded by us alone, and to be commanded by the precepts of
Him who was crucified: for He only is the beloved, and only (begotten) of that
God alone, who is over all ?
</p>
<p><b>49.</b> I myself however, investigating for myself with effort<A HREF="#100"><SUP>100</SUP></A>, and
in the love of truth, this same thing (singly), should perceive not one virtue
in it (making it) credible, nor even any thing great, or worthy of faith, nor so
persuasive, as adequate to the persuading of even one illiterate person, much
less men wise and intellectual. Nevertheless, when again I view its power, and
the result of its doings; how the many myriads have given their assent to it,
and how Churches of tens of thousands of men have been brought together, by
these very deficient and rustic persons; --nor that these were built in obscure
places, nor in those which are unknown, but rather in the greatest cities, I say
in the Imperial city of Rome itself, in Alexandria, in Antioch, in all Egypt, in
Libya, in Europe, in Asia, both in the villages and (other) places, and among
all nations; I am again compelled to recur to the question of (its) cause, and
to confess, that they (the Disciples) could not otherwise have undertaken this
enterprise, than by a Divine power which exceeds that of man, and by the
assistance of Him who said to them, &quot;Go<A HREF="#101"><SUP>101</SUP></A>, <i>and make Disciples
of all nations in my name.&quot; </i>And, when He had said this to them, He
attached to it the promise, by which they should be so encouraged, as readily to
give themselves up to the things commanded. For He said to them, &quot;<i>Behold</i><A HREF="#102"><SUP>102</SUP></A><i>
I am with you always, even to the end of the world.&quot; </i>It is stated, <A HREF="#337"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|337</SPAN></A>
moreover, that He breathed into them the Holy Ghost with the Divine power; (thus)
giving them the power to work miracles, saying at one time, <i>&quot;Receive ye
the Holy Ghost</i><A HREF="#103"><SUP>103</SUP></A><i>;&quot; </i>and at another, commanding them, to
&quot;<i>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out Demons:---freely ye
have received, freely give</i><A HREF="#104"><SUP>104</SUP></A><i>.&quot;</i>
</p>
<p><b>50.</b> Even you yourself see therefore, how this their word took effect; since
even the Book of their Acts attests things like to these, and which accord with
them ; how,--<i> </i>(for example,) when writing also of those by whom
miraculous deeds were done in the name of Jesus<A HREF="#105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>,--those, who were
present and saw, were astonished. They were astonished, as it should seem, at
those who had formerly seen (this power) by means of deeds ; and who then made
them (<i>i. e. </i>the chief Priests,) readily to ask, Who this was, by whose
power and name the miracle had been wrought ?--And thus, as they taught, they
found that these had in faith (even) run before their instruction. For, it was
not by words that they were persuaded; but it was by the deeds which preceded
these, that they were readily prevailed upon to accede to the things said. It is
also said, that men suddenly brought to them sacrifices and libations, as if
they had been Gods ; thinking that one of them was Mercury, the other Jupiter:
and the whole of this astonishment was, to their minds, a demonstration that the
deeds done were miraculous. And, as all those which they preached respecting our
Saviour, were such as these, they were thenceforth quickly, and with propriety,
received. Nor did they give their testimony of His resurrection from the dead,
by mere words and without proofs; but, by their power and by deeds did they
persuade, and shew forth the works of the living (God).
</p>
<p><b>51.</b> If<A HREF="#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A> then, they preached that He was God, and the Son of God,
and that He was with the Father before He came among men ; Why should they not
have especially added to this, that they believed what was adverse to have been
impossible and incredible ? For they must have justly thought it impossible,
that these acts could have been <A HREF="#338"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|338</SPAN></A> those of men ; but, on the contrary, those of God, even the more though no
one would say (this).
</p>
<p><b>52.</b> And this, and nothing else, is indeed the thing required, (viz.) by what
power the Disciples of our Saviour gained credit from those, who had from the
first heard them: and how they persuaded both Greeks and Barbarians to think of
Him, as of THE WORD OF GOD: and how they set up in the midst of the cities, and
in all villages, Houses<A HREF="#107"><SUP>107</SUP></A> (appropriated to) the Doctrine of the
worship of the supreme God. And, Who is not also astonished at this, when he
considers with himself, and feels satisfied, that this could not have been of
man ; that never at any former time, were the many nations of the whole creation
subject to the one sovereign rule of the Romans, except only since the time of
our Saviour? For it happened, immediately upon His passing about among men, that
the affairs of the Romans became great<A HREF="#108"><SUP>108</SUP></A>;--that, at that time,
Augustus was primarily the sole Sovereign of many nations; and that in his time
Cleopatra was inflamed with love; and the traditionary (kingdom) of the
Ptolemies in Egypt was dissolved<A HREF="#109"><SUP>109</SUP></A>. For, from that time, and until
now, that kingdom which was from ancient time; and of it, as one might say, the
ancient germ of men which was established in Egypt, have been rooted up. From <A HREF="#339"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|339</SPAN></A>
that period too, have the Jewish people been in subjection to the Romans; as
has that, in like manner, of the Syrians, the Cappadocians, the Macedonians, the
Bithynians, and the Greeks; and, to speak collectively, all the rest of those
subject to the rule of the Romans; and, that this did not come to pass without
regard to the Divine teaching of our Saviour, Who will not confess, when He has
considered, that it would not have been easy for His Disciples to be sent forth,
and to pass into foreign parts, when all the nations were divided one against
another ? and when there was no one uniting element among them, on account of
the many Satraps (stationed) in every place, and in every city ? But, in the
extirpation of these, they immediately, fearlessly, and with pleasure, set about
doing that which had been placed before them; because God, who is over all, had
previously made their course peaceful, and had restrained the wrath of the
worshippers of Demons in the cities, by the fear of the great Empire. Consider
then, If there had not been something to restrain those who had been stupified
with the error of a plurality of Gods, how they would have contended with the
Doctrine of Christ. For, you would doubtless have seen in every city and
village, commotions (stirred up) against each other, with persecutions and wars
of no mean description <A HREF="#110"><SUP>110</SUP></A>, had the worshippers of the Demons possessed
the sovereign rule over us. But now, this also is a work of the God who is over
all, that He might subdue <A HREF="#340"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|340</SPAN></A> the enemies of His word, by the greater fear of a superior kingdom. For it
was His will, that (His word) should daily increase and extend itself to all
mankind : and again, so, that it should not be thought, that, it was by the
connivance of the Rulers, and not by the superior power of God, it took effect.--When
any one of the tyrants was so elated by wickedness, as to set about resisting
the word of Christ, the God of all even allowed such at once to do his will;
because he would afford proof to those combatants for (establishing) the worship
of God, and also that it might be seen clearly by all men, that it was not by
the will of man that the word was established, but by the power of God himself.
And, Who is not instantly amazed at the things which usually come to pass in
times such as these<A HREF="#111"><SUP>111</SUP></A> ? For, those ancient combatants from among men
for the worship of God, kept secret<A HREF="#112"><SUP>112</SUP></A> the nature of their superiority
; at that time they became known and seen by all, when they were adorned with
the victories which were from God : while those, who were the enemies of the
worship of God, received the punishments which were justly their due: chastized
(as they were) by strokes sent from God, and their entire bodies wasted by
grievous and incurable diseases, so as to have been speedily driven to confess <A HREF="#341"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|341</SPAN></A>
their wickedness in opposing our Saviour<A HREF="#113"><SUP>113</SUP></A>! But these, the rest of
all those who were worthy of the Divine name (Christian), and who gloried in
thinking of the things which belonged to Christ, did in a short time shew,--being
brought through trials,--the purity and refining of their minds, and that they
had thus also obtained freedom for their souls. And soon did God cause, that, by
their means, THE WORD, the Saviour, should arise (as the sun) on tens of
thousands.&nbsp;

him as a shepherd; &quot;Miramur, si Democriti pecus edit agellos cultaque, dum

Laertius: whence it should seem that he was a man of most extensive erudition,

Egypt; and St Austin says, it was generally believed among the heathen, that he
wrote some books about magic too, which be delivered to Peter and Paul for the
use of his disciples. Hence it was that Suetonius, speaking in the language of
his party, calls the Christians, <i>Genus homimem superstitionis maleficae, the
men of magical superstition. </i>As Asclepiades, the judge in Prudentius, styles
St Romanus the martyr, the Arch-magician. And St Ambrose observes in the Passion

the Christian Church. And, although Irenaeus (Lib. ii. cap. ii. p. 200. Edit.
Grabe) speaks of <i>Tradition, </i>not written, but delivered viva voce<i>; </i>it
is evident enough, that he intends to ascribe to this no independent authority:
for in the very same context he informs us, that the Heretics, against whom he
was writing, were found, when opposing this Tradition, resisting the
declarations also of the Scriptures. Ancient Tradition, when found accordant
with the Scriptures, may indeed be relied on; but, it is from an examination of

q. &quot;Parabolani&quot; of the Latins, and <font face="SPIonic"> Para&amp;boloi</font><i> </i>of the
Greeks. The following is Bingham's account of the term. (Ant. Christ. Church,
Book i. c. ii. sect. 9.)...&quot;They&quot; (the heathen) &quot;gave them&quot;
(the Christians) &quot; the names of <i>Parabolarii </i>and <i>Desperati, the
bold and desperate men, </i>The <i>Parabolarii </i>or <i>Parabolani </i>among
the Romans, were those bold adventurous men who hired out themselves to fight
with wild beasts, upon the stage or amphitheatre, whence they had also the name
of <i>Bestiarii </i>and <i>Confectores. </i>Now, because the Christians were put
to fight for their lives in the same manner, and they rather chose to do it than
deny their religion, they therefore got the name of <i>Paraboli </i>and <i>Parabolani;
</i>which, though it was intended as a name of reproach and mockery, yet the
Christians were not unwilling to take it to themselves, being one of the truest
characters that the heathens ever gave them,&quot; &amp;c. And, again, (Book
iii. c. ix. sect. 3.) &quot; These were those whom the Romans called <i>Bestiarii,
</i>and sometimes <i>Paraboli </i>and <i>Parabolarii, </i>from the Greek word <font face="SPIonic">
Paraba&amp;llesqai</font>,<i> </i>which signifies exposing a man's life to danger, as
they that fought with wild beasts did...and it is the opinion of Gothofred and
some other learned critics, that the ancient reading of the Greek copies of...
Phil. ii. 30, was [Greek],<i> </i>exposing his life to danger, as an old Latin
interpreter of Puteanus renders it, '<i>Parabolatus de anima sua.' </i>See also
Wetstein on the place. This name was also given to some officers of the Church,
who thus adventured their lives in visiting the sick.&quot; Bingham, ib.

<p><A NAME="#79"></A>79.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> I would remark here, that by <i>&quot;binding and loosing,&quot;
</i>can only be meant, the office,--committed primarily to the Apostles, and
secondarily to all duly authorized Ministers of Christ--of preaching, <i>ministerially,
</i>the remission of sins through faith in Him: the fact being, that no one of
the Apostles ever did, in his own person, proceed to pronounce pardon of sin on
any man, nor, on the other hand, to denounce damnation : this mode of speaking
of any thing as done, when the enunciation of it only is intended, being very
frequently had recourse to in the Scriptures. See my Heb. Gram. Art. 154, 8;
157, 6, second or third edit.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#80"></A>80.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Both Estius (in difficil. Script. loc. in Marc. viii. 29.) and
Dr Hammond (Annot. on the title of Matt.) have also noticed this, as Eusebius
has. (Prep. Evang. Lib. iii. cap. vii.) &quot;St Peter's humility,&quot; says
the former, &quot;would not suffer him to tell these&quot; (honourable)
&quot;things to St Mark, when he was writing his Gospel&quot;...&quot;which
evidences the great modesty of the Apostle.&quot; Dr Hammond:...&quot;He (Peter,
and after Him Mark) doth it, (mentions his denial, &amp;c.) <i>more coldly </i>than
Matthew had done, only <font face="SPIonic">e1klaie</font>...<i> </i>Matthew, <font face="SPIonic"> e1klaie
pikrw~j</font>.&quot; Jones
(on the Canon, Vol. in. p. 65.) well remarks,...&quot;There is not any one
single instance in all his Gospel (i.e. Mark's) which tends to advance the
honour...of Peter above the rest of the Apostles;...which cannot be accounted
for by any way more probable, than supposing that the Apostle did not publish
those circumstances which were so much in his favour.&quot; He also remarks,
that, Peter's working a miracle, in order to pay the tribute, is omitted by
Mark. See Matt. xvii. 24. Mark ix. 30-33. Our Lord's saying he would pray for
Peter, Luke xxii. 31--32, is also omitted. Peter's humility in not allowing
Christ to wash his feet, is also omitted. (John xiii. 6.). Peter's zeal in
cutting off the High Priest's servant's ear, John xviii. 10, is also omitted, as
is his faith in leaping into the sea, John xxi. 7: also the particular charge to
feed His sheep, John xxi. 15: as also the prediction of his martyrdom, John xxi.
18. It is worthy of remark too, that all these omissions were made in <i>the
city of Rome, </i>where Peter taught, and where Mark, most likely, wrote his
Gospel! Surely the Apostle never could have intended to be elevated there as
superior to all the Apostles, and head of the whole Christian Church ! Is it not
probable that his intention was, to guard against the assumption, which he
foresaw would be had recourse to ?

Did not exist in the Greek of our translator.--See also Fabricii Salutaris Lux
Evangelii, cap. ii. p. 16. seq.--It has been very common to suspect this passage
as spurious, or as partly so; and some have gone so far as to charge Eusebius
with the fraud. See the notes of Valesius to the Eccl. Hist. l. c. above. The
chief ground for this suspicion appears to be, Josephus's saying, <i>This was
the Christ, </i>when, in fact, he was no Christian. But, Is it necessary to
suppose this ? The Rulers of the Jews must have known that Jesus was the Christ;
and yet, they resisted Him, even to the uttermost! They were acquainted with His
miracles, and His resurrection. Did they act accordingly? Quite the contrary!
Much the same might be said of thousands among ourselves, who willingly give
their testimony to the historical fact of Jesus being the Christ, but who are
still as little friends to His cause as Josephus was. Whatever may, therefore,
be the fact of the case, as to this reading, I do not see how it can be impugned
on grounds so fallacious as these. My own impression is, that it is not
spurious.&nbsp;

<p><A NAME="#109"></A>109.&nbsp;<i><sup>7</sup> </i>The authors of &quot;The Universal History,&quot; tells
us, after reciting the amours of Julius Caesar and of Mark Anthony with
Cleopatra, (Vol. ix. p. 480, Edit. 1747,) that &quot;In her ended the family of
Ptolemy Lagus, the founder of the <i>Egyptian </i>monarchy, after it had ruled
over Egypt, from the death of Alexander, two hundred and ninety four years, or,
as others will have it, two hundred and ninety three, and three months. For from
this time <i>Egypt </i>was reduced to a <i>Roman </i>province, and governed by a
praetor sent thither from <i>Rome.&quot;--</i>On the prophecies of Daniel
relating to this period, the work of Sir Isaac Newton on this subject, or
Rollin's Ancient History, may be consulted with advantage.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#110"></A>110.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> It must be borne in mind, that this refers solely to the times
in which the Apostles preached: for, in these, they generally suffered no
persecutions, except from the unbelieving Jews. We have a remarkable instance
illustrative of this argument recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, (ch. xxii.
23--30): where it is evident that, if Paul had not been a Roman, or had omitted
to stand upon his privilege as such, he would have been scourged, if not put to
death, by the Centurion: and also, that if no Centurion had been there, he would
have been stoned to death by the Jews. The Roman power therefore, although
afterwards a persecuting one, did contribute certainly to the furtherance of the
Gospel.--This argument is urged also above, Book in. sect, l. seq.; and in the
Prep. Evang. Lib. i. cap. iv. p. 10, also in the Orat. de laudd. Constant. Cap.
xvi. p. 541.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#111"></A>111.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Reference (see also Eccl. Hist. Lib. ix. cap. ix. p. 293. B.) is
probably here made to some of those marvellous things done in ancient times in
favour of God's Church. In the Ecclesiastical History of our Author, the
deliverance from Egypt is thus compared with the erection of the Christian
Church. Paulus Orosius makes a similar comparison, (Lib. vii. cap. xxvii. See my
Sermons and Dissertations, Lond. 1830, pp. 309--10.), and Lactantius treats this
matter much at length in his admirable Tract, &quot;<i>De mortibus
Persecutorum.&quot; </i>See also, on the death of Domitian, Suetonius, Lib. xi.
cap. xvi. seq. Galerius was the instigator of the last persecution. See his
miserable end. Hist. Eccl. Lib. viii. cap. xvi. p. 257. seq. See also, ib. Lib.
ix. cap. vi. p. 287. ib. cap. x. p. 297. B. C. ib. p. 298. D. seq. also

the fall of Pharaoh and his host, has more immediate reference to the Roman
Emperors, who took an active part in the persecutions of the Church. See the
authorities just referred to, particularly Euseb. Hist. Eccl. Lib. viii. cap.
xvii. p. 257. This part closes with Demonstr. Evang. Lib. iii. ib. p. 141. A.
