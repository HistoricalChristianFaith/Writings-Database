to the online edition.</b></p>
<hr>

<p>The patristic period in Britain ends with the collapse of Roman power, at the
end of the 4th century AD.&nbsp; The circumstances under which this occurred are
difficult to make out, and what followed is likewise obscure to us.&nbsp; The
sub-Romano-Britons fought against the invaders whom the legions had kept in
check, at first with little success, then with greater force leading to the
victory at Mount Badon, some time in the late 5th century.&nbsp; A generation of
peace followed; the barbarian attacks resumed, and the British defence
crumbled.&nbsp; The Britons were expelled into the west, there to become the
early Welsh or Cornish, and the invaders created the primitive kingdoms of early
Anglo-Saxon England in their place.</p>
<p>One of the casualties of the onset of the Dark Ages was the loss of literacy,
and so little of the literature of the time has been preserved for us.&nbsp; In
the chances of the years, the tract or sermon of the monk Gildas, &quot;On the
Ruin of Britain&quot;, has survived, together with fragments of his letters and
a penitential and lorica which may owe something to him.&nbsp; While Gildas is a
medieval figure, rather than a patristic writer, his inclusion in this
collection may be justified for the light he throws on the end of the patristic
period in Britain.</p>

<p>The first part of his tract outlines recent history, before lambasting the
five weak and morally corrupt leaders upon whom the Britons had to depend, and
who had so signally failed to carry out their duty to anyone but
themselves.&nbsp; While it was never his purpose to write a history, the
destruction of almost all other evidence has left his work of considerable
historical importance, albeit his failure to be clear is frustrating.&nbsp; No
doubt his audience knew in great detail the events now mysterious to us; and
like the defeated everywhere, did not desire to reminded in detail of the things
they strove to forget.</p>

<p>The translations given here are from the Hugh Williams translation of
1899.&nbsp; This is in two weighty volumes, with massive annotation, all
interesting but much of very doubtful relevance.&nbsp; Most of the notes have
been omitted.&nbsp; In addition I have omitted the medieval <i>Lives</i> of
Gildas, as mainly hagiography and of no relevance to this collection.&nbsp; I
understand that a further volume entirely composed of notes exists, but this I
have not seen.&nbsp; A large chunk of notes deals with the type of biblical text
used by Gildas; the Vulgate, when he quoted at length, but reverting to the Old
Latin when he quoted snippets from memory.&nbsp; Interesting as these are, again
they have been omitted.&nbsp; The Latin text of Mommsen has been excluded also.</p>
