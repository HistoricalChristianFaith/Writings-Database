THE LORICA OF GILDAS.
</h3>
<P>
GILDAS composed this lorica to drive away those demons which attacked him. To him an angel came, and the angel said to him: If any man repeats that lorica often, there shall be added a seven years' portion to his life, and the third part of his sins shall be blotted out. Whatever day he recites this prayer . . . men or demons, and enemies can do him no injury; death on that day touches him not. Laidcend, son of Buith the Victorious, came from him to the island of Ireland; he brought over and carried it to be placed on the altar of St. Patrick, bishop, to make us safe. Amen. The metre is of eleven syllables, which is also called <I>bracicatalecticon, </I>because it consists of eleven syllables; the scansion is so.

Help unity of trinity,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have pity trinity of unity;&nbsp;<br>
 Help me, I pray, thus placed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as in the peril of a great sea,<BR>
So that the plague of this year<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; draw me not with it, nor the vanity of the world.&nbsp;<br>
 And this very petition I make unto the high<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powers of the heavenly warfare,&nbsp;<br>
 that they leave me not to be harried by enemies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but defend me with their strong armour;&nbsp;<br>
 that, before me in the battle, go<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those armies of the heavenly warfare,&nbsp;<br>
 Cherubim and Seraphim with their thousands,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabriel and Michael with like ones.&nbsp; <A NAME="p307"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|307<br>
</SPAN></A>May thrones, powers, archangels,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; principalities, dominions, angels,&nbsp;<br>
 defend me with their thick array,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and be strong to overthrow my enemies.&nbsp;<br>
 Then also the other arbiters of the strife----<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patriarchs four, prophets four,<BR>
Apostles, watchmen of the ship of Christ,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the athlete martyrs all----I ask,&nbsp;<br>
 And adjure also all virgins,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faithful widows, and confessors,&nbsp;<br>
that safety compass me by them,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and every evil perish from me.&nbsp;<br>
 May Christ make with me a strong covenant,&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He whose terror scares away the foul throngs.
