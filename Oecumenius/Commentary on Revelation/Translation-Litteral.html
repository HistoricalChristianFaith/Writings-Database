commentary that was written by Oecumenius in the sixth century has been considered by many scholars to be the first full Greek Bible commentary written on the book of Revelation. The first complete commentary to have been written on the book of Revelation was in Latin by Victorinus of Pettau in the late third century. The Latin Church universally accepted the book of Revelation as canonical earlier than the Greek Church, therefore, commentaries on the book of Revelation in the Greek Church came at a later time than it did in the Latin Church, which is why it took nearly three centuries later for a Greek commentary to be produced than for a Latin commentary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The identity of Oecumenius has been debated for some time due to the lack of written documentation about him. Many modern scholars have rejected the idea that the Oecumenius who wrote this commentary on Revelation to be the same commentator of other New Testament commentaries (Acts-Jude). They refer to the authorship of those other commentaries to be &ldquo;pseudo-Oecumenian.&rdquo; I take the position that it is the same Oecumenius who wrote the commentary on Revelation and Acts-Jude. So far, I have translated his commentaries on 1 Timothy-Jude, and now the commentary on Revelation. My main motivation for translating this commentary on Revelation at this point in time is to compare the commentary on Revelation with the other commentaries attributed to Oecumenius. I figured that this would allow me to compare the styles and similarities as well as the differences. Before I translated the commentary on Revelation, I had already felt that the styles were similar and probably from the same author, and now, after translating the Revelation commentary, I am even more convinced that it is the same author for all of the commentaries. &nbsp;I am in good company when it comes to the Oecumenian authorship of all the Bible commentaries. H.C. Hoskier</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c7 c2">, who produced the first critical Greek text of the commentary on Revelation by Oecumenius also held that it was the same Oecumenius. For a complete argument made concerning the Oecumenian authorship, I have written thoroughly about it in the introductions to my other translations of the commentaries by Oecumenius. Now, I want to demonstrate some of the similarities and differences between the commentaries of the other New Testament books by Oecumenius verses this commentary on Revelation.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c41 c33">Similarities</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">In this translation of the commentary on Revelation by Oecumenius, I have provided eighty-four excerpts from all of his other commentaries on the New Testament. These excerpts have been chosen because they match particular citations of Scripture that Oecumenius made while commentating on the book of Revelation. The goal in mind is to compare how Oecumenius interpreted those particular passages of Scripture in his other commentaries as related to the context that he was using them for in his interpretations on the text of Revelation. For example, while Oecumenius was interpreting Revelation 15:1-4, he quoted 1 Corinthians 3:12-13 in his interpretation. Not only do the explanations share similarities in both commentaries, Oecumenius also quotes exactly the same other two Scripture passages in both places, that being James 3:2 and Job 14:4-5. Another example is when Oecumenius explains the meaning of Rev. 19:10. He quotes Hebrews 1:14 while interpreting Rev. 19:10. Not only does he make the connection between the two passages, but in both places he quotes Gregory of Nazianzen&rsquo;s Orations as an example. But the most striking of all examples is when Oecumenius is explaining the meaning of Revelation 8:1-2, he quotes 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 1 Corinthians 15:52. In his commentary on 1 Cor. 15:52, Oecumenius explains the meaning of that Revelation passage concerning the seventh seal, and he gives the same analogy about &ldquo;a king&rdquo; that he gave in the comments on Revelation, and he also uses &ldquo;a king&rdquo; analogy in his commentary on 1 Thessalonians 4:16, therefore showing direct continuity between all three commentaries. The interpretations of that passage in Revelation that he wrote in this commentary on 1 Corinthians 15 share the same unique interpretation in his comments on Revelation that Oecumenius is known for! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c41 c33">The Excerpts</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">There are eighty-four excerpts throughout this commentary that I provided. In many places where Oecumenius quotes Scripture when providing an explanation to the meaning of Revelation, he quoted the Old and New Testaments many times. In those places where he quoted from the books that he wrote commentaries on, such as Acts-Jude, I translated those excerpts from his commentaries, and I placed those excerpts right below the place where he quoted those Scripture passages in his Revelation commentary. This not only allows the reader to compare his interpretations against one another, but it also adds value to the commentary on Revelation because there are places where the excerpts provide additional insight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">As mentioned above, there is noteworthy harmony between his commentary on Revelation and his other Bible commentaries. That is not to say that each and every place in the Revelation commentary that Oecumenius quotes Scripture that the excerpts from his other commentaries are in direct relation, because that is not the claim I am making. There are places where the relation between the comments are neutral. But that is to be expected because when a commentator quotes Scripture, it is not always necessary that the Scripture being quoted is bound to that one particular context that it is being used for. For example, when Oecumenius quotes a passage of Scripture from another book of the Bible while expounding on the book of Revelation, that quote of another book of the Bible is meant to assist in interpreting the passage in the book of Revelation, not to provide a full interpretation on that passage he is quoting from. In other words, you may find some helpful nuggets of insight on that one passage being quoted from, but in most cases that passage being quoted is not being dealt with directly and understood in the fullest possible context as it would be handled if it was being dealt with directly as if he would in his commentary on that particular book of the Bible. When Oecumenius quotes a passage like Ephesians 4:5 in his Revelation commentary, he is more than likely not going to give that passage nearly as much attention as he would if in his commentary on Ephesians because the main purpose is interpreting the passages on Revelation. Now sometimes you can find places where Oecumenius will quote a passage from another book of the Bible and he may expound on it more than usual, but that is not common because quoting other passages is meant to assist in bringing a fuller understanding to the context of the passage that he is writing the commentary on.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c41 c33">Differences?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One thing that I have noticed when translating the other Bible commentaries by Oecumenius was that he rarely ever quoted the book of Revelation. One might assume that he would have alluded to or quoted the book of Revelation more often than he did considering that he did write commentaries on Acts-Jude. The only place in his other commentaries that he did deal directly with the book of Revelation was in his commentary on 1 Corinthians, as I mentioned above</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c7 c2">. I did find a couple of places where it appears that Oecumenius alluded to the book of Revelation in his commentary on 1 John (comments on 1 Jn. 1:7; 2:13), but those are some vague examples. But it is not too surprising that one cannot find a lot of examples where he quotes the book of Revelation. One reason why Oecumenius did not quote from the book of Revelation more often is because he was from the Greek speaking church, and Oecumenius was at the (slow moving) cusp of a wider acceptance by the Eastern Church of the book of Revelation and its canonicity. Oecumenius may have shied away from quoting the book of Revelation more often in his other commentaries because he knew that a lot of other Eastern Christians who would read his commentaries would not have approved of the canonicity of Revelation and would reject his commentaries had he quoted Revelation throughout. Another reason that he may have not quoted the book of Revelation more often is because Oecumenius wrote many of his commentaries, not as an original commentator, but as a compiler of quotes. Oecumenius relied heavily upon earlier Church Fathers like John Chysostom, Theodoret of Cyrus, etc., who rejected the canonicity of the book of Revelation. It is likely that Oecumenius wrote his commentary on Revelation after he wrote all of his other commentaries due to the complexity of the book as compared to the other books of the Bible, and due to the lack of a demand for a commentary on the book of Revelation in the East. Oecumenius did not have the luxury of being able use another commentary on the book of Revelation like he did for all the other commentaries that he wrote. He only had a very limited amount of resources to use that ever dealt with the book of Revelation, such as some of the comments made by earlier Church Fathers like Gregory of Nazianzen, Basil, Cyril of Alexandria, etc., who all wrote very little concerning the book of Revelation. Oecumenius had to take the role as an original exegete while writing on Revelation, something that he never had to do prior. Even his contemporary Andrew of Caesarea, who wrote a popular commentary on Revelation not long after Oecumenius did, who was critical of the commentary by Oecumenius on Revelation, still had an advantage because he was able to at least build upon and/or write in opposition to Oecumenius based upon what Oecumenius had already taken a shot at and had already contemplated on and articulated. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c41 c33">The Uniqueness of Oecumenius on Revelation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Since Oecumenius was the first among the Eastern Church to write a commentary on the book of Revelation, and he had no other commentary to rely upon to use as a reference point, he had to take the knowledge of Scripture that he had, which was very impressive, and go from there. Unfortunately, this commentary by Oecumenius did not circulate and gain much popularity, and it became lost for many centuries until it was rediscovered in the early 1900&rsquo;s. One will find very unique interpretations on the book of Revelation in this commentary. It is up to you the reader to decide what exegetical value that you want to place on this commentary. I myself, have grown very fond of this commentary for the past two decades, and it has helped to shape my own perspective and understanding on Biblical eschatology and the meaning behind the book of Revelation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">A unique characteristic of this commentary is the Marian interpretation of chapter 12 of Revelation. Oecumenius understood &ldquo;the woman clothed with the sun&rdquo; to be the Virgin Mary. Oecumenius displayed a typical deep devotion to Mary from an Eastern Orthodox perspective, calling her the Mother of God. He even upholds the early doctrine laid out by Gregory of Nyssa that Mary did not suffer birth pains, but he understood that the &ldquo;birth pains&rdquo; were symbolic of Mary&rsquo;s anxiety concerning what Joseph might have thought about her pregnancy until the angel informed him that she conceived through the Holy Spirit. Oecumenius did an excellent job relating the passage in Revelation 12 about the woman and the Dragon to the accounts in the Gospels and the struggles that the Holy Family encountered with Herod trying to kill the infant Jesus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Another unique characteristic in this commentary is how Oecumenius interpreted the two beasts in the following chapter, Revelation 13. There is the beast coming out of the sea, and the beast coming out of the earth. This leads to three characters, the Dragon, the beast coming out of the sea, and the beast coming out of the earth. Many interpret the Dragon as Satan, the beast coming out of the sea to be the Antichrist, and the beast coming out of the earth as the False Prophet. Most understand the False Prophet to be someone who helps the Antichrist persecute the church in the End Times. But Oecumenius understands the False Prophet to be the Antichrist. Oecumenius understands the beast coming out of the sea to be another fallen angel, an entity equal or nearly equal to the angelic status of Satan. Sometimes Oecumenius refers to this being as the Devil, another devil like Satan, who is also called the Devil. And since this fallen angel is in relation to the Mark of the Beast, therefore Oecumenius does not relate the Mark coming from the Antichrist, but is in direct relation to this fallen angel. Oecumenius gives some possible calculations for the name of the beast. One in particular is the Greek name &ldquo;Lampetis.&rdquo; I find this very interesting because Lampetis literally means &ldquo;shining one.&rdquo; Oecumenius doesn&rsquo;t make the connection in his commentary to the Hebrew word for the &ldquo;serpent&rdquo; found in Genesis called &ldquo;nahash,&rdquo; but that word also means &ldquo;shining one.&rdquo; Oecumenius understood that there was an angelic fall from heaven that was the result of a rebellion by Satan and some other angels, with this beast coming out of the sea being a high ranking fallen angel, who comes out of the sea of Tartarus, which is a prison mentioned in 2 Peter and Jude where the rebellious fallen angels are held as punishment for their rebellion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Another unique interpretation by Oecumenius is Revelation chapter 20 concerning the thousand-year reign of Christ. This passage has led to various interpretations. Some called Chiliasm (or premillennialism), who believe that the thousand years is a literal 1000 years concerning a future earthly kingdom where Christ will reign with the resurrected saints while Satan is bound. There are others who take a symbolic view called Amillennialism, where they teach that the 1000 years is not a literal one-thousand years but symbolic for a very long time, which they call the &ldquo;church age,&rdquo; which they believe that spans from the day of Pentecost until the second coming of Christ at the end of the world, while Satan is bound, meaning hindered from using his entire power until the end, when he will be given a short time with full power to persecute the church. But Oecumenius had a different interpretation from both Chiliasm and Amillennialism. Oecumenius understood the thousand years to be symbolic for the period of the earthly life of Jesus, from the time of His conception to the death on the cross. Oecumenius understood the binding of the Devil was done to prevent Satan and the other fallen angels and demons from being able to derail the Lord&rsquo;s mission of the Incarnation and His ministry on earth leading up to the Crucifixion. And after Satan and the demons lost due to the work on the Cross, Satan was released and able to then go back and try to deceive the nations once again. But as Oecumenius points out, Satan&rsquo;s attack against Christians, though does great damage, but it also leads Christians to sainthood because Satan challenges Christians, &ldquo;For Satan is in a manner a trainer of men, providing an occasion of crowns to those who struggle.&rdquo; (see comments on Rev. 20:4-8)</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c33 c41">The Translation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The main source that I consulted for the translation of this commentary is based upon two critical Greek texts, the version by H.C. Hoskier called The complete commentary of Oecumenius on the Apocalypse, and the newer version called </span><span class="c0">Oecumeni commentarius in apocalypsin</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;by M. De Groote</span><span class="c2 c11">3</span><span class="c7 c2">. What makes this translation different from the other existing English translations is that I did not follow the critical text right down to the letter, but I adopted variant manuscript readings in places where I discerned were correct, versus the &ldquo;oldest&rdquo; manuscript readings that had scribal errors. The critical texts strictly followed the readings from the oldest manuscripts, but there were many places, especially the Scripture text of Revelation, that the oldest manuscripts erred, while the later manuscripts like manuscripts 203 and 240 had the correct readings. The scribal errors used in the critical text at times were so obvious and blatant that I am perplexed by the choice of using the erred readings from the oldest manuscripts for the critical text simply because it came from the oldest manuscripts. There were many occasions where the critical text would use the scribal errors in the Scripture text of Oecumenius but below in the comments by Oecumenius it had the correct readings, demonstrating that the editors chose the errors over the correct readings for no other reason than following the oldest reading. This level of strictness to textual critical rules were beyond what my conscience would allow, so I discerned the best that could to provide the correct readings.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Introduction footnotes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1.

The divine John, holier than all heralds and more spiritual than every spirit, having leaned upon the chest of the Lord (Jn. 13:25) and having drawn a more abundant grace of the Spirit through the kisses, was thus called the son of thunder (Mark 3:17). For he impressed upon the world beneath the heavens with his divine teachings. But indeed, his present treatise, concerning mysteries that are sparse [&#7984;&sigma;&chi;&nu;&#8182;&nu;] and obscure, justly holds the most secret and profound character, as one might well consider. For it is not only about present matters that we discuss, but also about things past and future. For this is characteristic of perfect prophecy to encompass the three distinct times; for even those from outside of Christianity bring in the seers [&mu;&#8049;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;] among them who know both the present and the future, and before the present</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c7 c2">, in the foresight of those among us, who, I believe, have become prophets. For those who consult oracles among them never possessed the knowledge of all things, since even the demons [&delta;&alpha;&#8055;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;] operating within them did not compel the one attempting to interpret spiritual matters to be spiritual and wise concerning divine things, as the divine apostle teaches that &ldquo;spiritual matters must be judged by spiritual things.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:13) But I have been so far removed from the operation of the Spirit, as much as from divine and highest wisdom; therefore, I have undertaken this endeavor more boldly than cautiously. </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 1 Corinthians 2:13</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;Not in humanly taught wisdom.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Therefore, Paul says we are wiser than those wise among men, insofar as some have Plato and Pythagoras as teachers, while we have the Holy Spirit. </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;But in teachings of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Therefore, there is nowhere need of human wisdom. For all things are spiritual. </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;spiritual matters must be judged by spiritual things.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;He says this when, he asserts, a spiritual question arises, we bring comparisons and solutions from spiritual examples; for instance: if Christ rose on the third day, I derive the proofs and testimony from Jonah (Jonah 1:7; Matt. 12:39-40, Luke 11:29-32); if a virgin bore the Lord, the solution comes from the barren Anne and Elizabeth. </span><span class="c9">[Anne: Traditionally recognized as the barren mother of the Virgin Mary.]</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">&ldquo;For wisdom does not enter a corrupt soul, nor does it dwell in a body burdened by grievous sins,&rdquo; (Wis. 1:4) as seems true concerning Solomon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, I chose to undertake a certain exercise, examining my own unthoughtful self within it. It is not unknown, as some have attempted to say regarding the present writing, that it is both spurious and inconsistent with the other works of John. But I bear witness to the genuine and divine nature of these soul-beneficial words, which are worthy of the author, and have been accepted and confirmed by reputable Fathers: Athanasius the Great in his exposition of the canonical books of both the Old and New Testaments</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c2">; Basil the Divine in his brief treatise On the Son</span><span class="c2 c11">3</span><span class="c2">; Gregory the Theologian in his treatise On the Coming of the Bishops</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c2">; Methodius the Most Wise in his discourse On the Resurrection</span><span class="c2 c11">5</span><span class="c2">; Cyril the Great, both by deed and word, in the sixth book of his Treatise On the Spirit and Truth; and in addition, Hippolytus the Divine in his Interpretation of Daniel.</span><span class="c2 c11">8</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But for brevity&rsquo;s sake we shall mention no more.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Such precise and numerous Fathers would not have considered this valid at all had anything in it been illegitimate and rejected. Nor indeed would such a view have been held by so great and such distinguished men unless they had known by every means and in every respect that it was complete in itself. For if it were not so, it certainly would not be what Solomon says in Ecclesiastes: &ldquo;A threefold cord is not quickly broken.&rdquo; (Eccles. 4:12) Moreover, the sixfold cord is all the stronger (it will not break).</span><span class="c2 c11">9</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What then does the sacred teaching of Christ reveal to us through the Revelation, and speak of His divine love?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">For it is necessary to write down the divine words from now on, having called upon His intercessions for help.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for preface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1.

For both Nestorius and Eutyches are equally detestable; their positions are opposed and totally evil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, in order that the teaching of our Savior might be precise and true to Him, having engaged in the other divine matters, as the Lord has said, here John employed words and thoughts suited to human beings; yet neither in those divine matters did he separate the divine from the human, nor here did he separate the human from the divine.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">Moreover, he used the writings to a greater or lesser extent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From this point on, </span><span class="c0">the revelation</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is given to him to speak; it is given from the Father to the Son, and it is given from the Son to us, </span><span class="c0">his servants</span><span class="c2">. Calling the saints the </span><span class="c0">servants</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;of Christ, He preserved for Him what is fitting for God. For whose servants would humans be, except for the Maker and Creator of humans? And who is the Creator of humans and all creation? No one except the only-begotten Word and Son of God. For he who is present as the author says in the Gospels, &ldquo;all things were made through him.&rdquo; (Jn. 1:3)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What, then, does John wish to add </span><span class="c0">what must soon take place</span><span class="c2">? And yet, of the things that are to come, not yet accomplished, already a considerable amount of time has already passed since these things were spoken, more than five hundred years</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c2">. That all ages are regarded as nothing in the eyes of the eternal and everlasting God; &ldquo;for a thousand years,&rdquo; the prophet says, &ldquo;are in Your sight, O Lord, as the day that has just passed, or as a watch in the night.&rdquo; (Ps. 89:4) Therefore, the swift passage of time is not measured by the completion of the years that have come to be, but rather by the power and eternity of God.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">For in truth, every extension of time, even if it is the greatest and longest, is considered small compared to the infinite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jesus Christ therefore </span><span class="c0">made it known</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to me </span><span class="c0">what must take place</span><span class="c2">. Jesus did not appear Himself and speak, but </span><span class="c0">through His angel</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;He initiated me into the mysteries. You see the reverent love of this divine one, who confessed that it was revealed to him through an angel and that he did not hear it from the Lord&rsquo;s own mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">John says that he </span><span class="c0">testifies to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">In this form, he also used it in the Gospels, preserving for himself the credibility of his teaching.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">He said, &quot;This is the one who testifies about these things,&quot; (Jn. 21:24) and having written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. And now he says he is a witness of the divine Word that was revealed to him. John speaks of the present Revelation and the testimony given by Christ; that is, through testimony, I am both a witness and an author.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 1:3</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear them and keep what is written in it; for the time is near</span><span class="c7 c4">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">He did not say only those who read are blessed, for many would be so blessed, since most read, but also those who hear and become obedient to the exhortations contained in it, and those who preserve and guard what is spoken as divine laws.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the time is near</span><span class="c7 c2">. For to everyone who keeps the commandments of God, the time of blessedness is near. It either means that, or &ldquo;near,&rdquo; he says, is the period of the time of departure. The term &quot;near&quot; has been interpreted in previous contexts.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 1:4a</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;John to the seven churches in Asia: Grace to you and peace from God, who is, and who was, and who is to come</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c7 c2">he says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">This is equivalent to saying, &quot;Grace to you from God, the Father of all of you.&quot; For the Father names Himself, revealing Himself to the wisest Moses at the burning bush, saying, &quot;I AM THE ONE WHO IS [&#7952;&gamma;&#8061; &epsilon;&#7984;&mu;&iota; &#8001; &#8036;&nu;].&quot; (Ex. 3:14) And indeed, concerning the Son, the divine evangelist present says, &quot;In the beginning was the Word; and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot; (Jn. 1:1) And again, in the first of the Catholic Epistles: &quot;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life.&quot; (1 Jn. 1:1) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who is to come</span><span class="c7 c2">.

This comment by Oecumenius gives us a basic idea when Oecumenius wrote his commentary on Revelation. John is thought to have written his commentary around 90A.D., but it depends upon when Oecumenius assumed that John wrote the book of Revelation. So it would be at least the 6th century when Oecumenius wrote it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. Athanasius, Ep. 39.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3. Eusebius of Caesarea, Paschal Chronicle 250c.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4. Gregory of Nazianzus, Orationes 42.9.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5. Oecumenius, in his commentary on Acts 1:9 says&hellip; And having said these things, while they were watching, Jesus was taken up; leading them to another place on the shore, so that they would not question him again, he immediately began his ascent into heaven. And he adds, while they were watching: since here the whole beginning of their faith and need was established, but not the end of the matter. For this reason also the angels explained that Jesus rests in heaven; for they were unable to see him that far away. In the resurrection, however, it was the opposite: the beginning indeed was not seen by them; for it would have been unnecessary, since the one who had risen appeared alive, and the tomb was empty; but the end was apparent, for the living one was revealed to them&hellip; Indeed, a cloud received the Lord, to demonstrate the equality of honor to the Father. For it is said of the Father: A cloud and darkness are round about Him. (Ps. 97:2) And indeed God who became flesh, having used a cloud as a chariot, for He was the Lord: but Elijah, fire. (2 Kings 2:1) For Jesus, being the Master of all, and ascending by his own power, takes a somewhat earthly and lower path toward the ascent, not being carried but carrying the vehicle; but Elijah is a servant, and therefore needing an unprofitable chariot and horses, the speed of which aids him in the upward journey. Therefore, it is said of him: Elijah went up in a whirlwind as into heaven; but of the Lord it is said, As He was going up into heaven. Two white-haired men are attested to confirm the Lord&rsquo;s restoration into heaven, because the word is established upon two or three witnesses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">6.

The Lord mentioned this inscription also in the Gospels, saying to His disciples: &quot;Do not rejoice that the demons are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in Heaven.&quot; (Luke 10:20)</span><span class="c7 c25">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says, </span><span class="c0">but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels</span><span class="c2">.

For it is also said in the Gospels: &quot;Whoever confesses me before men, I will also confess before my Father who is in Heaven.&quot; (Matt. 10:32)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And to speak concerning the Father and His angels does not exclude that the holy angels are also His; for sometimes they are of the Father, and sometimes of Himself.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">For it is said in Matthew: &ldquo;Then the Son of Man will send out his angels with a great trumpet call; and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.&rdquo; (Matt. 24:31)</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 3:7-13</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the True One, He who holds the key of David, He who opens and no one will shut, and He who shuts, and no one opens: I know your works.

Behold, I come quickly; hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown. He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To those </span><span class="c0">in Philadelphia, it says, write: These things says the Holy one, the True one</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c0">The Holy one</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is indeed the Son of God. Then this is also testified by the Seraphim, who unite a threefold &ldquo;holy&rdquo; into one lordship, having nothing earthly or sinful, even though the Word became flesh.</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">For he committed no sin. Nor was deceit found in his mouth,&rdquo; according to the voice of the prophet Isaiah. (Isa. 53:9)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And it is true that it is also said, </span><span class="c0">the True one</span><span class="c2">; and He also is called God, and the title is not false.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For God is truly Emmanuel, even if the accursed Nestorius does not wish this; He became man without ceasing to be God, and He is truly man, even if the God-hated [&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&upsilon;&gamma;&#8052;&sigmaf;] Eutyches finds this difficult.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">Which is truly the case, and nothing but a matter of fact, not as the Nestorians claim by way of allegory, nor as the Eutychians assert by opinion or imagination, nor the accursed and detestable race of the Manichaeans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says </span><span class="c0">He who holds the key of David</span><span class="c2">. To </span><span class="c0">hold the key</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;means to hold authority. For the one entrusted with the </span><span class="c0">key</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of the house is given the authority to </span><span class="c0">open</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and to </span><span class="c0">shut</span><span class="c2">. And this is clearly demonstrated in the Gospels in the promises made to Peter. &ldquo;For I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&rdquo; (Matt. 16:19) Since therefore the </span><span class="c0">key</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;signifies authority, the one </span><span class="c0">who holds the key of David</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;clearly indicates that just as David reigned over the physical Israel, so too I reign over both the physical and the spiritual Israel, although the nature of the authority is exchanged with incomparable superiority. For what equality is there between man and God? This was also proclaimed by the divine angel Gabriel to the virgin concerning the Lord, saying, &quot;And the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign over the house of David forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.&quot; (Luke 1:32-33) Since Christ founded [&#7952;&phi;&epsilon;&#8166;&rho;&epsilon;&nu;] a likeness to the kingdom of David, it is fittingly said by the one </span><span class="c0">who holds the key of David</span><span class="c7 c2">. Then, having remained firm in the manner of the key, He brings it forward: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He who opens and no one will shut</span><span class="c2">; </span><span class="c0">and He who shuts, and no one opens</span><span class="c7 c2">. For if God is the one who justifies; who is the one who condemns? If God is the one who condemns; who is the one who justifies? For He says to open and to shut, means to justify and to condemn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says, </span><span class="c0">I know your works</span><span class="c2">, that you are godly; and </span><span class="c0">I have set before you an open door</span><span class="c2">. And he said beforehand: The one who opens, and no one shuts, so also the door which I have given opened, </span><span class="c0">and no one can shut it</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c0">Because, </span><span class="c2">he says, </span><span class="c0">you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name</span><span class="c2">. Philadelphia is a small city, therefore its strength is also small.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">But in guarding the faith of Christ beyond her own strength, she rose as unyielding, to remain among those who trouble the faithful. Then, as a recompense for her genuine loyalty to Him, he promises that many from the Jewish census [&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&#8057;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;] will run to join her and receive the faith of Christ. For this act of worshiping at her feet signifies that even in the last times, to be chosen and appointed as a member of the church is to be part of the church. The prophet, embracing this, said: &ldquo;I chose to be cast down in the house of my God rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners.&rdquo; (Ps. 83:11) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because you have kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you from the hour of trial</span><span class="c2">. He speaks of the persecution of Christians that occurred under Emperor Domitian, who was the second persecutor after Nero, as Eusebius</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;records in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Chronicon Canon. It was during this time that the divine evangelist was condemned to live on Patmos, a small and deserted island.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am coming quickly</span><span class="c7 c2">, he says, having taken hold of you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown</span><span class="c7 c2">. And what do you hold fast? The genuine love toward the Lord, evidently, in which, having persevered until the end, you will receive the crown of life (James 1:12). For to those who endure, belong the victories; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">and </span><span class="c0">he who overcomes,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says, that he will make them to sit with him always in the sight of God; for this is to become the </span><span class="c0">pillar of the </span><span class="c2">divine</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;temple</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For the </span><span class="c0">pillar</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;could never </span><span class="c0">go out</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;for any good reason from the place in which it is fixed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, and My new name</span><span class="c2">. Through all this, the enjoyment of God and dwelling in goodness and blessedness are fully revealed, whatever they will possess in the age to come. And he says that the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;name</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is new, one that has perhaps not yet been heard, which the saints reigning with Christ receive, being called friends (Jn. 15:15), brothers (Heb. 2:11), and servants (1 Cor. 4:1). And indeed, he also receives a </span><span class="c0">new name</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;beyond these things. For some have been recorded in the divine Scripture and have come to the hearing of men; but the </span><span class="c0">new name</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;is nowhere named. </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Hebrews 2:11</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot;I will put my trust in him.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Since he previously called Him brother and internally father, he signifies that these indeed are names of kindness and grace, but by nature and truth, God is, he says.

And to Moses, God spoke, saying: &ldquo;No one shall see my face and live.&rdquo; (Ex. 33:20) But even the evangelist states decisively: &ldquo;No one has ever seen God.&rdquo; (Jn. 1:18) Therefore, God was not seen resembling anything; rather, the vision of Him was depicted through the works of God by the Revelation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For the </span><span class="c0">jasper</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is a precious stone, this one is emerald-like and green, resembling the venom of an asp</span><span class="c2 c11">3</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#7984;&#8183; &#7936;&sigma;&pi;&#8055;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;], from which it also derived its name.

The jasper is said to symbolize for us the nourishment of God, and provision, since all nourishment for humans, four-footed animals, birds, and crawling beasts has its origin, and as it were its cause, beginning from green grass. For the prophet says: &quot;He causes grass to grow for the cattle, and vegetation for the service of mankind, to bring forth bread from the earth. And wine gladdens the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil.&rdquo; (Ps. 103:14-15) And again, in the creation, God says: &quot;Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind.&quot; (Gen. 1:11-12) Now, jasper illustrates these things.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">But indeed, the carnelian is described as the fearfulness of God; for our God is said by the advocator</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#7985;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&#8049;&nu;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;] Moses to be &ldquo;a consuming fire&rdquo;, (Deut. 4:24) and the prophet also cries out to Him: &ldquo;You are fearful, and who can stand before Your face?&rdquo; (Ps. 75:8) Accordingly, the wise Apostle writes: &ldquo;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&rdquo; (Heb. 10:31)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Since the goodness of God is incompatible with those who love sin and are scornful, and is pure, not leading to repentance but to the freedom to commit wrongdoing, it is reasonable that God, along with goodness, also possesses the generous and the awe-inspiring; therefore Paul, knowing the character of those learning and the need for incentives rather than gentleness, addressed the Corinthians, saying: &ldquo;What do you want?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Should I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:21) Yet one of the saints</span><span class="c2 c11">5</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;(Basil) said, &quot;Gehenna does not frighten you; the kingdom does not urge you on?

But, if it is lawful to say, we &lsquo;force&rsquo; Him, and He leaves behind His natural gentleness, and is led by unnatural sternness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it is said that </span><span class="c0">a rainbow encircling the throne appeared like an emerald in appearance</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The perceptible </span><span class="c0">rainbow</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#7988;&rho;&iota;&sigmaf;] which the divine Scripture calls the bow</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&tau;&#8057;&xi;&omicron;&nu;] of God, consisting of the reflection of the solar light, when it is diverted in the thickness of a cloud, has become multicolored and numerous in color. But that one, the spiritual </span><span class="c0">rainbow</span><span class="c2">, which encompasses the divine </span><span class="c0">throne</span><span class="c2">, was of one kind; for it was </span><span class="c0">emerald in appearance</span><span class="c2">.

Everything indeed is bound to one single color; for all things are equally beneficial and bear the likeness of their own Master, of the emerald color that itself attests to its productive power, just as the jasper does to God. And let no one stumble over those who encounter it; Why indeed are the sacred orders of the spiritual beings concerning God are overshadowed by the more precious stone of the </span><span class="c0">emerald</span><span class="c7 c2">, while God Himself is associated with the less precious jasper and carnelian? For the discussion is not now about the value of what is visible, but about the meanings signified by the colors. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">For if someone were to seek honor in a petty way, there would be nothing for which God could be accused, nor would anyone find fault with it; that is, that the Lord is rejected with a stone. For Isaiah says, &quot;Behold, I am placing a cornerstone in Zion concerning the Lord.&quot; (Isa. 28:16) And the prophet speaks of the stone that the builders rejected concerning him. The evil spirits are allegorized as mountains; for David himself said that mountains can be moved&mdash;&quot;in the hearts of the seas,&quot; and &quot;the mountains were shaken in his mighty power,&quot; (Ps. 117:22) whose magnitude is so great that it is impossible to find anything greater than it.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 4:4-6</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">He says that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">around the throne there are twenty-four thrones; and upon these twenty-four thrones sit elders clothed in white garments, with golden crowns upon their heads.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And from the throne come flashes of lightning, voices, and thunder; and before the throne that burn seven lamps of fire, which are the seven spirits of God.

As far as my speculation goes, they were Abel, Enoch, and Noah; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Melchizedek and Job; Moses and Aaron; Joshua son of Nun and Samuel; David, Elijah, and Elisha; the twelve minor prophets represented as one figure; Isaiah and Jeremiah; Ezekiel and Daniel; Zechariah and John; James son of Joseph, and Stephen, the witnesses of the new covenant. It could be said that Peter, Paul, and James, the brother of John, whom Herod killed by the sword (Acts 12:2), along with the rest of the holy apostles, if they did not have a promise from the Lord, would not now, but rather in the Renewal of All Things</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&iota;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;&#8055;&#8115;], sit upon twelve thrones, distinct from those already mentioned.

And the four living creatures, each of them having six wings around, were full of eyes within; and they had no rest day or night, saying, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come</span><span class="c7 c4">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One cannot say that those sacred </span><span class="c0">creatures </span><span class="c2">were exactly like the ones that the prophet Ezekiel was deemed worthy to behold in his vision (Ez. 10:13).

Here, however, each had a single face, though different from one another, and </span><span class="c0">six wings</span><span class="c2">. And those were the Cherubim, for that is how they are called in Ezekiel. These others, as I believe, are the Seraphim, shown in Isaiah the prophet (Isa. 6:2), although Isaiah neither mentioned any faces for them nor described them in detail, only that they covered their faces with their wings; not that they had many eyes, but that they had </span><span class="c0">six wings</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But what was meaning of these great things shown to the evangelist? Was there some deception among certain Jews?

We humbled our souls, and you did not pay attention.&rdquo; (Isa. 58:3) But such a deception came upon them from a certain written passage that says, &ldquo;Lord, in heaven, your mercy and your truth reach to the clouds.&rdquo; (Ps. 35:6)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">As it shows that divine providence proceeds by disregarding the sins committed below on earth, the vision therefore reveals to the evangelist that God&#39;s providence extends through all things, both overseeing those in Heaven and those who have come to dwell on earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And this is symbolized by the </span><span class="c0">four</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;holy </span><span class="c0">living creatures</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;surrounding the divine throne.

The Meaning: This refers to the eschatological (end-times) restoration of creation to its perfect, pristine state, removing the effects of decay and the fall.

For how could what is </span><span class="c0">sealed </span><span class="c7 c2">be revealed, given the transgression in Adam? Rather, the majority, immersed in sin, have prepared the little scroll to be sealed. For there were those (the majority, immersed in sin) who were innumerable, just like the few who were pleasing to God, who were allowed to speak freely; this freedom and the boldness before God inscribed within them all alike was sealed, since &ldquo;everyone turned away and became corrupt&rdquo;, according to the prophet (Ps. 13:3): for even though a few succeeded and were counted among the righteous in the past, they were merely human and did not become worthy to reclaim for all people the boldness lost through sin. Knowing this, the prophet cried out to God: &ldquo;In the morning, when You hear the voice of my prayer, in the morning I will stand before You and You will look upon me.&rdquo; (Ps. 5:4) &ldquo;In the morning&rdquo;, calling to mind the appearance of Christ, &ldquo;the Sun of Righteousness,&rdquo; (Mal. 4:2) having dispersed the darkness of ignorance. In this, humanity will gain boldness; and not otherwise. So that those who pray may be heard, and may be deemed worthy of this vision, with Christ having removed the sin that separates us from God. Before his visitation to humanity, &ldquo;every mouth was closed, and the entire world was held accountable to God&rdquo; according to what is written (Rom. 3:19). Therefore, the deep things recorded in the scroll, as has been said, indicate that the scroll was sealed and closed.</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Romans 3:19</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c18">So that the Jews may not say, &quot;Why do these things against us?&quot; For it was not said absolutely concerning us. &quot;Yes,&quot; he says, &quot;concerning you.&quot; For we all know this, that whatever the law declares (and by &quot;law&quot; he means the whole Old Testament), it speaks to those under the law.

In some manuscripts of the commentary by Oecumenius, there is a gap (lacuna) in the Scripture text. The missing section reads, &ldquo;and break its seals?&rdquo; But no one in Heaven, on earth, or under the earth was able to open the scroll&rdquo;. Though there is a gap in the Scripture text of the commentary, Oecumenius does comment on the missing text in his comments below the Scripture text. In other words, the original Scripture text that Oecumenius has does not omit that section</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. In Ancient Greek, &beta;&#943;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; was the primary word for &quot;papyrus&quot; or &quot;scroll,&quot; while &beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#943;&omicron;&nu; was originally a diminutive meaning &quot;little scroll&quot; or &quot;small book&quot;. Over time, however, the diminutive sense was lost, and &beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#943;&omicron;&nu; became the common word for &quot;book&quot; or &quot;document&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3. &ldquo;worshippers of God&rdquo; [&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigma;&epsilon;&beta;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigmaf;] &Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigma;&epsilon;&beta;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigmaf; means &quot;godly,&quot; &quot;pious,&quot; or &quot;worshippers of God,&quot; a plural form of the Greek adjective &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigma;&epsilon;&beta;&#942;&sigmaf;, combining theos (God) and seb&#333; (to worship/revere), describing people showing deep reverence, piety, and right action toward God. And historically called &quot;God-fearers,&quot; who were Gentiles attracted to Judaism but not fully converted, often observing Jewish practices like Sabbath and prayer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4. The Greek word &#7952;&theta;&nu;&#8182;&nu; is the genitive plural of &#7956;&theta;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;, meaning &quot;of nations,&quot; &quot;of peoples,&quot; or &quot;of Gentiles&quot;. Its specific meaning depends on context, but it can refer to groups of people as nations or tribes, and in a biblical context, it often means non-Jewish people (Gentiles).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">5.</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">the Word who became man [&#7952;&nu;&alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&#942;&sigma;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;] and was made flesh [&sigma;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&omega;&theta;&#941;&nu;&tau;&alpha;].&rdquo; The Greek word &#7952;&nu;&alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&#942;&sigma;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota; is a theological term meaning &quot;having become man&quot; or &quot;incarnate&quot;. The word &quot;&sigma;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&omega;&theta;&#941;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&quot; means &quot;incarnate&quot; or &quot;became flesh.&quot; It derives from the verb &sigma;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&#972;&omega;, which means to give flesh or to incarnate.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c16">CHAPTER 6</span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 6:1-4</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And when He said,</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And I looked, and behold, a white horse, and the one sitting on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and He came forth so that the one who conquers may be victorious. And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And another horse came out, fiery red, and to the one sitting on it was given the power to take peace from the earth so that people would kill one another, and a great sword was given to him</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The closing and sealing of the little scroll, which contains the names of the people written in it, signifies that it is unalterable, and that their mouths are shut from any justification before God, according to what has been previously stated (Rev. 5:1). Therefore, the gradual removal of the seals signifies the gradual repetition of the boldness and intimacy toward God, which the only begotten One, having become incarnate, has made possible for us by correcting our shortcomings through His own deeds. It must be understood that the breaking of each </span><span class="c0">seal</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;signifies one of the acts performed by the Lord for our salvation, and also those carried out by Him against the spiritual enemies of our souls. For the Lord&rsquo;s providence toward us involves the overthrow of those powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let no one be amazed at those things that will happen, that the Only Begotten existed before becoming incarnate; for the works and deeds before His coming to us are shown to the divine evangelist through vision.

This is the bodily birth established by the Lord, which sanctified our birth so that we are no longer conceived in lawlessness and carried in sins by our mothers, but we have a holy birth of Christ through our own birth, by which the human birth is blessed. And a witness to such a noble ambition toward humanity is the divine apostle, who writes: &ldquo;since your children are unclean, but now they are holy.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 7:14)</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 1 Corinthians 7:14</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c18">For if the unfaithful part is not overcome by the purity of the faithful, he says, nothing prevents the born ones from being defiled, or half-pure.

In order to deliver all those who would believe, Christ taught those who were alive on earth at the time of his incarnation, and these others acknowledged him when he appeared to them in the lower regions, and thus they too benefited from his coming. Going in his soul, he preached to those who were in hell, appearing to them as one soul to other souls. When the gatekeepers of hell saw him, they fled; the bronze gates were broken open, and the iron chains were undone. And the only-begotten Son shouted with authority to the suffering souls, according to the word of the new covenant, saying to those in chains: &#8213;Come out!&#8214; and to those in darkness: &#8213;Be enlightened.&#8214; In other words, he preached to those who were in hell also, so that he might save all those who would believe in him. For both those who were alive on earth during the time of his incarnation and those who were in hell had a chance to acknowledge him. The greater part of the new covenant is beyond nature and tradition, so that while Christ was able to preach to all those who were alive at the time of his appearing and those who believed in him were blessed, so too he was able to liberate those in hell who believed and acknowledged him, by his descent there. However, the souls of those who practiced idolatry and outrageous ungodliness, as well as those who were blinded by fleshly lusts, did not have the power to see him, and they were not delivered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">12.

Amen.&rdquo; Then one of the elders spoke and said to me, saying, &ldquo;These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;my lord, you know.&rdquo; And he said to me, &ldquo;These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation; they have washed</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

For when we are baptized we put off sins, which the death of Christ began to effect. For he died also for our sins, wishing to set us free from them. Thus the death of Christ effected the putting off and the mortifying of sins, and in so far as it could it bore the whole burden. What remains is only our faith and perception and will. These things are manifested through baptism; as it is performed, the death of Christ becomes all the more apparent in how it purchased salvation. Therefore he rightly says, &ldquo;We were baptized into his death,&rdquo; as if into dying a death like his, burying sins by baptism, and that the profit of his saving death should be shown most clearly through all things, and that by baptism we should introduce our mind and will and faith toward the completion of salvation. He uses a more admonishing tone to explain how we die to sin, and says: &ldquo;Do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?&rdquo; For baptism imitates death; for this is what it signifies, &ldquo;We were baptized into his death.&rdquo; Even if baptism is not a bodily death, it is nevertheless a death to sins. &ldquo;Through baptism into death.&rdquo; Since in being baptized we confess that we have died to the world and renounce sin and the Devil.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">But also the partaking of the life-giving blood of Christ grants this: for the Lord says that it is poured out for many and for the forgiveness of many concerning His own blood.

There are other Oecumenius manuscripts</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">that reads &ldquo;and the angels&rdquo;, that being, 203 (Salonika) and 240 (Athos). In this instance I chose to use the reading in a couple of later manuscripts instead of the reading found in some of the earlier manuscripts, simply because it is the correct reading and in my opinion, it is probably what Oecumenius originally wrote. Older manuscripts do not always equal the correct readings in all cases.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">6. &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">they have washed their robes</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;. Like pointed out in note 5, the primary reading chosen by the editor of the critical text chose to use a variant reading different than the correct reading found in the manuscripts of the book of Revelation. The primary reading in the critical text reads &ldquo;they have enlarged their robes&rdquo;. Which means that the older manuscript reading has &#7952;&pi;&lambda;&#940;&tau;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&nu;, while to correct reading is &#7956;&pi;&lambda;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&nu;, which means &ldquo;washed.&rdquo; &#7952;&pi;&lambda;&#940;&tau;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&nu; is an obvious scribal error because even when Oecumenius comments on it he uses &ldquo;washed&rdquo; [&#7956;&pi;&lambda;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&nu;],not &ldquo;enlarged&rdquo; [&#7952;&pi;&lambda;&#940;&tau;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&nu;]. The manuscripts with the correct reading is 203 (Salonika) and 240 (Athos).

For it was also said that the first voice I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, &ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.&rdquo; (Rev. 4:1) And you have become a narrator to us of things not yet come to pass but already happened, recounting the birth of the Lord, the temptation, the teachings and divine signs, the lashes and bonds and the wounds inflicted by Pilate, the cross and the death, and the resurrection and the ascent, or rather, the return to Heaven. To this I would say: most certainly you have heard, my friend, and some of the things that will happen, whenever we recount the righteous among the nations together with Israel around the divine throne, and those who exist with the Lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And now you also hear in the breaking of the </span><span class="c0">seventh seal</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">For the one who said to the evangelist, &quot;Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things,&quot; (Rev. 4:1) did not remove from him the ability to see anything that had happened before, but along with those, he also revealed what was to come. Therefore, listen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The breaking of the </span><span class="c0">seventh seal</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;has accomplished for us the most perfect glory; for no longer is the release from sins and the turning back to God and from God to us as before, but rather the indescribable blessings: to be called children of God, &ldquo;heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ,&rdquo;(Rom. 8:17) brothers and friends and children of Christ, to reign with Him (2 Tim. 2:12) and to be glorified together, (Rom. 8:17) and &ldquo;what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man, these good things.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:9) What then is the breaking of the </span><span class="c0">seventh seal</span><span class="c7 c2">? It is the second coming of the Lord and the restoration of all good things.

With these same trumpets, the dead were also about to be awakened; for the wise apostle to the Thessalonians, writing about divine matters, says in the first epistle that &ldquo;the Lord Himself will descend with a command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God.&rdquo; (1 Thess. 4:16) </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 1 Thessalonians 4:16</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c34"><span class="c23 c33">&quot;</span><span class="c23 c8">For the Lord Himself</span><span class="c23 c33">.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;And he gives the reason why those who were to die beforehand were not prevented. </span><span class="c23 c8">&quot;with the voice of an archangel.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;He says &quot;the voice of an archangel,&quot; that is, the command given to the angels appointed to gather, making all ready, as if the Judge had arrived.

But the meaning must first be briefly explained; the evangelist John says in the Apocalypse that the end will not come upon all men at once, but will come to them in part by the mercy of God, so that those who remain of the first to perish may, through fear of those who have been previously consumed, come to repentance; and he states this teaching in the breaking of the seventh seal of the book. If you hold these things thus, you will understand the phrase &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye</span><span class="c18">&rdquo; to be said collectively, and fittingly applying to both, so that it shall be thus: we shall not all fall asleep, that is, die, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, because the end comes in part, according to the account in the Apocalypse; yet all of us shall be changed </span><span class="c9">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye</span><span class="c18">, at the last trumpet; for the first trumpets, seven as they are according to the Apocalypse, do not raise the dead, but end humankind, whereas the final one effects both the resurrection and the change of those already risen &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye</span><span class="c18">,&rdquo; together with creation; for creation also will be freed from corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God, as it is said in the Epistle to the Romans. (Rom. 8:21) &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">in a moment</span><span class="c18">.&rdquo; He furthermore said something admirable, namely that such great miracles will be imperceptible in time at the same time as the sound of the trumpet: Question. Since according to certain manuscripts these words of the Apostle are read: &ldquo;We shall all indeed sleep, but we shall not all be changed.&rdquo; According to others, however: &ldquo;We shall not all indeed sleep, yet we shall all be changed.&rdquo; I ask to be taught which of the editions ought to be chosen, and what is signified by these words. Answer. I think that according to either edition, since the old manuscripts include both, if one accepts reverently, it will not depart from the apostle&rsquo;s intention. Therefore the passage &ldquo;We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed&rdquo; must be understood thus: that indeed we shall all endure sleep and slumber through death; but we shall not all be changed into glory and freedom; which the apostle states elsewhere more plainly, saying: &ldquo;If indeed we are clothed, we shall not be found naked.&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:3) Next to this indeed: &quot;Not all of us will sleep, yet we shall all be changed,&quot; it must be understood in this way, that we shall not truly sleep a prolonged sleep requiring a tomb and ending to corruption, but they will undergo a brief death which will be found to be instantaneous: for them a prolonged sleep will not be necessary, on account of the sudden resurrection having been made</span><span class="c9">; yet all will be changed</span><span class="c18">, that is, they will put on incorruption. </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;For the trumpet will sound.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Then, showing what is to be believed concerning those things which will happen, he says: </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;For the trumpet will sound, and the dead shall be raised,&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;evidently changed and incorruptible; and we, that is, those of us who remain alive until that time; for he speaks of them and not of himself: &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">and we shall be changed</span><span class="c18">.&rdquo; For among these there will be no resurrection: since they will not have slept, but only an alteration. Truly the dead who had previously died </span><span class="c9">will be raised incorruptible</span><span class="c18">, but those who then live&mdash;how will they be raised?

For it is said somewhere that &ldquo;if you send forth your spirit, they shall be created, and you will renew the face of the earth.&rdquo; (Ps. 104:30) It was no longer good to strike any of the creatures that inhabit the earth, neither </span><span class="c0">tree</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;nor any of the growing things, except only the humans; and among the humans, </span><span class="c0">those who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads</span><span class="c2">. For among the humans, some are entirely holy and pure, having taken possession of the space mentioned earlier, always united with Christ, and beholding the divine throne. Yet they are nevertheless holy, having been baptized, and bearing the sign of Christ </span><span class="c0">on their foreheads</span><span class="c2">, and not entirely despairing, though they have deeply defiled themselves by the absurdity of their actions; but,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">because of their baptism, as if being somewhat intermediate, they remain on earth in both virtue and vice, yet unpunished. For if this were not so, how could those who are well-disposed manage the entrusted resources? It has been said by the Lord, &quot;He who has authority over ten cities,&quot; and another &ldquo;over five cities.&rdquo; (Luke 19:17, 19.) As those who are about to rule the less capable, and yet the rulers remain completely unpunished. For who would choose to rule if they were to be punished and relentlessly hear the gnashing of teeth, and the inconsolable weeping (not of the holy ones, I do not say, but not even of ordinary people who nonetheless sympathize) unless he himself were also about to suffer similarly to those being punished for the sake of those under his care?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The third fate of humans is indeed handed over to punishment, being sinners and impious, and not accepting the faith of Christ.

One must blend the opinions of both sides. I say this as in a kind of exercise, and not as a definitive statement; for I add to the doctrine of the Church that which wishes the punishments in the future to be eternal, since even this was said by the Lord in the Gospel according to Matthew, saying, &quot;And these will go away into eternal punishment&quot; (Matt. 25:46); and Isaiah said, &quot;Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched.&quot; (Isa. 66:24)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">As in an exercise, therefore, this must be said: a middle portion of each part of the path is to be marked out, because until a certain time&mdash;</span><span class="c0">five months</span><span class="c2">, as the present Revelation, having employed a certain secret number, has said&mdash;the sinners will be severely </span><span class="c0">tormented</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">as if</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;stung </span><span class="c0">by a scorpion</span><span class="c2">; but after this, gradually, although we will not be entirely free from punishment, it will be to such an extent that we </span><span class="c0">will seek death and not find it</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For who would have a need to seek death for those who are not punished at all? </span><span class="c0">Death</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">will flee from them</span><span class="c7 c2">, for they share in punishment eternally.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 9:7-12</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And the likenesses of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men, and they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions; and they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle; and they had tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails was their power to hurt men for five months.

For with such chains, we certainly punish those condemned by us. But someone may say: Whence is such condemnation of the demons evident? From the demons themselves, for they plead in the Gospel (Luke 8:31) not to be cast into the abyss, as if all others might also suffer this. It must be understood, however, that although the argument is presented in a hypothetical manner, it is not truly so; for it has nothing else to respond to later, but is proposed only in appearance, while in truth it is a simple persuasive example: and for this reason, it will be said: for if it were as it seems, it would proceed thus: If angels, having sinned, were not spared, nor the ancient world, nor Sodom and Gomorrah, would He spare these? Certainly not; or even in this way: He will not spare them at all. However, He does not rashly approach those who are more distinguished; but wishing to show that these, while they sin, are more liable to punishment. Therefore, since these also hold a more honorable rank, as they are called to the apostleship, when they have fallen from the divine way, they also have a greater condemnation. From the hypothesis moved by a persuasive example, it did not provide what corresponded to the figure.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">And Isaiah also cried out concerning him that &ldquo;the sword of God will be brought down upon the dragon, the fleeing serpent, upon the crooked serpent; and he will destroy the dragon on that day who is in the sea.&rdquo; (Isa. 27:1) And the prophet, speaking about him after all creatures have passed away, adds this concerning those who are in the sea: &ldquo;This dragon which you have fashioned to mock him&rdquo; (Ps. 104:26); following these words, the divine prophet Ezekiel also speaks concerning the Egyptian, saying: &ldquo;You are like a lion among the nations, and like a dragon in the sea, and you mingle with your rivers.&rdquo; (Ezek. 32:2) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">No one, indeed, has transmitted a tradition to us that they were </span><span class="c0">bound in the Euphrates River</span><span class="c2">, nor will they ever be released, nor will people be punished through them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For Jude, who said that they are &ldquo;bound with eternal chains,&rdquo; forbade that they should ever be loosed; and the one who said through Isaiah that the Dragon in the sea will be destroyed on the day of judgment, declared that no one else would destroy him but that very one. And the Lord, sending forth in the Gospels those who have sinned into &ldquo;the fire prepared for the Devil and his angels,&rdquo; (Matt. 25:41) declared that He would use them as punishers and executors of justice, and that they themselves are destined to suffer punishment. How then could one understand the previously mentioned statement that they are </span><span class="c0">bound in the river Euphrates</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;and that they will be released and will themselves punish the sinners?

For through the remembrance of God there is spiritual joy, for the same one writes that elsewhere he &ldquo;remembered God and was glad,&rdquo; (Ps. 76:4) but through not confessing repentance&mdash; for confession is the declaration of those who have sinned, arising from remorse and turning back through shame that comes near to the soul.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">For in truth, God has appointed for us two lives, the present and the future.

Locusts in Greek &#7936;&kappa;&rho;&#943;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf; is the plural of &#7936;&kappa;&rho;&#943;&sigmaf; meaning &quot;grasshopper, locust, cricket&quot;. Locust (in some cultures distinguished from a grasshopper and used as a food source)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">2. Oecumenius has in mind the many prominent Early Church Fathers, particularly those in the East, believed in or hoped for some form of universalism (the ultimate salvation of all souls, also known as apokatastasis [&#7936;&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#940;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;], restoration of all things</span><span>&nbsp;[</span><span class="c3">&tau;&#8182;&nu; &pi;&#940;&nu;&tau;&omega;&nu;], referring to the belief that all creation would eventually be restored to its original perfect state.). This was a widely held view for the first few centuries of Christianity, although it was not universally accepted and was later condemned as heresy by the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 AD. In Alexandria, this school, which included the highly influential theologians Clement of Alexandria and Origen, was a major center for universalist thought. Origen, in particular, was the most famous and influential advocate of the view, although his teachings were later rejected by some. The Cappadocian Fathers, several figures associated with this group, including St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Basil of Caesarea, and St. Gregory of Nazianzus, are often cited as universalists or at least hopeful for universal salvation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">3. &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; [&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;&#942;&nu;] The Greek word &lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;&#942;&nu; is the accusative singular feminine form of the adjective &lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;&#972;&sigmaf;, which means reasonable, rational, or spiritual.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Derived from the Greek noun &lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf; (logos, meaning &quot;word&quot; or &quot;reason&quot;), its specific meaning can vary slightly based on context.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4. Oecumenius says in his commentary on Jude 6, &ldquo;Those who had indeed received the honor of angelic position, since they did not remain in their origin, but corrupted the gift given to them from the goodness of celestial life, were reserved and kept for judgment or condemnation on the day of great and intolerable punishment. For this also now signifies kept. According to what Christ said: &quot;Who is prepared for the devil and his angels.&quot; (Matt. 25:41)&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">5. &ldquo;in the twentieth section&rdquo;. Oecumenius gives no explanation in this commentary to why he divided his commentary into 12 discourses and multiple sections. The Early Church Fathers did not use the modern system of biblical chapters and verses, as these divisions did not exist until many centuries after their time. Instead, they referenced Scripture by book and often by thematic sections, continuous quotation, or general location within the text.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">There were some early attempts at division. As early as the fourth century, the New Testament was divided into topical sections called &kappa;&epsilon;&phi;&#940;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; (headings). However, these divisions do not correspond to the modern chapters.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">[Sixth Discourse]</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c16">CHAPTER 10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Moreover, John, the divine narrator in the present discourse, recounts the events that occurred when the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, which I have not yet fully explained all at once, since the fifth discourse is so long, I therefore did not reveal it in full. But what else does he write that has happened?</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 10:1-4</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I saw a strong angel descending from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little open scroll. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the land, and cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, &ldquo;Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken, and do not write it down.</span><span class="c7 c4">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, those who, while still alive, having heard or even seen the punishments inflicted upon the wrongdoers, did not repent, but remained wicked as previously stated, John says that </span><span class="c0">I saw an</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">angel descending from heaven</span><span class="c7 c2">, bringing images of punishments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says that his vision and form were as follows: he was , </span><span class="c0">clothed with a cloud</span><span class="c7 c2">. The cloud symbolizes the eternal and invisible nature of the holy angels; for the cloud is a symbol of the unseen. The prophet, indicating the invisible nature of God, describes &ldquo;clouds and thick darkness are round about him.&rdquo; (Ps. 97:2)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And a rainbow was upon his head</span><span class="c7 c2">; as if the head and the foremost among the good angels were saying, it is brightness; for angels are beings of light. (2 Cor. 11:14) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his face is said to be like the sun</span><span class="c2">; and this too is an appearance of pure brightness. But the </span><span class="c0">rainbow</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is the brightness of a created nature, signifying virtue; therefore, the brightness of the rainbow is not uniform, but varied, indicating all the virtues of the angels. The </span><span class="c0">sun</span><span class="c2">, indeed, signifies their natural brilliance by a gleaming light. Therefore, it was surrounded by a </span><span class="c0">rainbow</span><span class="c7 c2">, for virtues are around us; but its face resembled the sun, for in us all natural excellence is present in abundance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his feet were like pillars of fire</span><span class="c2">. The </span><span class="c0">fire</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;signifies the punishment that he came to bring upon the impious. And he is said to have held </span><span class="c0">in his hand a tiny open scroll </span><span class="c2">[&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;]</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c7 c2">. Daniel, recalling such small scrolls [&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#8055;&omega;&nu;], says: &ldquo;before him sat a judge, and scrolls [&beta;&#8055;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;] were opened.&rdquo; (Dan. 7:10) The tiny scroll [&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;] was one in which were recorded the names and the multitude of the very impious who were to be punished. Therefore, it was also diminutively called a &quot;tiny scroll&quot; [&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;], since it is a kind of scroll [&beta;&#8055;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;]. Both terms have been used in the Holy Scripture, in which the names of all men are written, according to what was previously stated by me. The term &quot;tiny scroll&quot; [&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;] refers to the record containing the names of the exceedingly impious. For the worshippers of idols were not so numerous, nor marked by murders and poisonings and other afflictions that would serve to fill an entire scroll small [&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#8055;&omicron;&nu;] with the diseases they caused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the land</span><span class="c7 c2">. This was a sign both of the greatness of the saints and a sign that those who have sinned on the earth as well as those in the sea, such as shipwrecked individuals or others who have committed evil deeds, would bear the consequences of punishment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars</span><span class="c7 c2">. And it is said that the holy angel of wrath was symbolically represented as having roared like a lion, signifying the judgment against the impious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And when he said, &quot;he cried out,&quot; </span><span class="c0">the seven thunders uttered their voices</span><span class="c2">. The seven thunders refer to the seven ministering spirits whose memory has been mentioned earlier; therefore, it is placed after the article. He says, &quot;</span><span class="c0">the seven thunders</span><span class="c7 c2">,&quot; referring to those seven spirits to which the reference pertains. What then is the meaning of the seven spirits crying out? It is that they also fully correspond with the punishments inflicted upon sinners, offering a grateful hymn of praise to God, acknowledging that all things have been done justly. At the same time, the one who cried out clarified the various forms of punishments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says that he was </span><span class="c0">about to write </span><span class="c2">what was spoken to the seven spirits. And </span><span class="c0">I heard a voice from heaven saying, &quot;Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken, and do not write it down</span><span class="c7 c2">.&quot; The act of sealing, in one sense, involved impressing the memory firmly upon your mind; but the prohibition against writing it down was a matter of divine economy, for which God knows the reason. Perhaps the punishments that are glorified are actually lighter, and worthy of the goodness of the one who punishes, making them shameful to humans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What do Gregory</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the Divine and Evagrius</span><span class="c2 c11">3</span><span class="c2">, the great authority on Gnostic matters, say about these things? Gregory asserts that &ldquo;the punishment surrounding Adam is an act of generosity, for therefore I believe God punishes.&rdquo; And in another context, &ldquo;neither mercy is indiscriminate nor is judgment merciless.&rdquo; Evagrius, however, declares that &ldquo;the more recent and worldly thinkers should be forgotten regarding the superior discourse on judgment; for they do not understand the suffering of the rational soul condemned to ignorance</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c7 c2">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 10:5-7</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by the living one who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that there will be no more delay. But in the days of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound the trumpet</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he declared to his servants the prophets.</span><span class="c2 c11">5</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">According to the form of omission, it is stated: for it says that when </span><span class="c0">the seventh angel is about to sound the trumpet</span><span class="c2">, all the punishment against the impious </span><span class="c0">will be fulfilled</span><span class="c7 c2">, being both various and many. However, it does not say that this will happen when he sounds the trumpet in the vision, since the other events have not yet occurred at that time, but rather when he sounds the trumpet at the appropriate time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When this occurs, he says that </span><span class="c0">the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he declared to his servants the prophets</span><span class="c2">. For the prophets foretold up until the judgment and the recompense of the good and the wicked, but not after that.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">Therefore, when the seventh angel sounds, the mystery will be completed, and every prophetic announcement will come to an end.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 10:8-11</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I heard a voice from heaven again, speaking with me and saying, &ldquo;Go, take the little scroll </span><span class="c2">[&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#8055;&omicron;&nu;]</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land.&rdquo; And I went to the angel and said to him, &ldquo;Give me the little scroll.&rdquo; And he said to me, &ldquo;Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.&rdquo; And I took the tiny scroll </span><span class="c2">[&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;]</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;from the hand of the angel and ate it; and it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.

For he did not know this from experience, being a holy man and a virgin</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c7 c2">, and through this he came to understand that the wrath of God against the impious is just.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The </span><span class="c0">little scroll</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#8055;&omicron;&nu;] contained both the names and the sins of those who had greatly erred, as previously stated</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c2">.

Such was also the tree forbidden by God in Paradise, which all interpret as leading to sin, producing knowledge of both good and evil (Gen. 2-3); sweet indeed in taste, but evil after experience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says to me, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">You must prophesy again concerning peoples, nations, languages, and many kings</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; as if he said: because you have already seen in a vision both the end of the present age and the wrath against the ungodly, do not consider the day of the end to be present in deed; there is a long time in between, during which </span><span class="c0">you must</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;also </span><span class="c0">prophesy</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to many </span><span class="c0">nations</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and kings</span><span class="c7 c2">.

In this passage, the usage of three variations of the Greek words for scroll is used by Oecumenius &beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;, &beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#8055;&omega;&nu; (plural for &Beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#943;&omicron;&nu;), and</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c18">&beta;&#8055;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&iota; (plural for &Beta;&#943;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;). In Ancient Greek, these three terms are etymologically linked through a series of diminutives, where each successive word traditionally refers to a smaller or more specific version of a &quot;book.&quot; &Beta;&#943;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;, originally, this referred to the inner bark of the papyrus plant (the material used for writing). It evolved to mean a complete &quot;book&quot; or &quot;record,&quot; often implying a significant or formal work. In the Septuagint and New Testament, it is used for major records like the &quot;Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ&quot; (Matthew 1:1) or the &quot;Book of Psalms&quot; (Luke 20:42). &nbsp;&Beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#943;&omicron;&nu;, is a diminutive of &beta;&#943;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;, meaning &quot;little book&quot; or &quot;scroll&quot;. Over time, it became the standard word for &quot;book&quot; in general, losing much of its &quot;smallness&quot; nuance in everyday speech. It is used for legal documents, such as a &quot;bill of divorce&quot; (Matthew 19:7), or for specific scrolls, like the one Jesus unrolled in the synagogue (Luke 4:17). &nbsp;&Beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#940;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu; is a double-diminutive, literally meaning an &quot;extra-small book&quot; or a &quot;booklet&quot;.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">This term is rare and specifically emphasizes the small size of the object. It appears famously in Revelation 10:2, describing a &quot;little scroll&quot; held by an angel, distinguishing it from larger prophetic books.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2.

Gregory of Nazianzus and Evagrius Ponticus were influential 4th-century Christian thinkers who had a significant teacher-student relationship in Constantinople, where Evagrius served Gregory as a deacon, deeply absorbing his theology, especially concerning the mind, soul, and spiritual struggles, influencing Evagrius&#39;s own ascetic and mystical writings on prayer, demons, and the eight &quot;evil thoughts,&quot; bridging Cappadocian theology with desert monasticism for Eastern and Western traditions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5. Not all Oecumenius manuscripts have &ldquo;the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he declared to his servants the prophets.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, it is omitted by the oldest manuscript, therefore omitted in the primary critical text.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">6. While the Bible does not explicitly state the marital status of most apostles, long-standing Christian tradition and early ecclesiastical writings maintain that John the Apostle remained a virgin throughout his life. Early Church Fathers such as St. Augustine and St. Jerome frequently referred to John&rsquo;s lifelong virginity. Jerome, in particular, argued that John&rsquo;s &quot;virginal purity&quot; was the reason Jesus favored him as the &quot;beloved disciple&quot; and entrusted the Virgin Mary to his care at the Crucifixion. Early non-canonical &quot;lists&quot; of apostles, such as those found in some Christian apocrypha, explicitly categorize John and his brother James as having remained virgins, while noting that other apostles like Peter and Philip were married.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">A common theological argument is that Jesus chose John to look after Mary because they shared the same state of virginity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7.

But exclude the outer court of the temple; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.</span><span class="c7 c4">&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the visions that had come before</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c7 c2">, the apparition revealed to the divine John the multitude of saints accompanying Christ and the divine throne they beheld, among whom those from the nations far outnumbered those from Israel. But now, another vision shows him how many, or rather how few, were esteemed in the time of the Old Covenant, and how many in the era of the New.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And see how cleverly this is depicted to him. He is </span><span class="c0">given a measuring rod</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to </span><span class="c0">measure the temple of God and the altar</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;within the temple, clearly referring to the one in Jerusalem, </span><span class="c0">and those who worship</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;there. And he measured; for those who were counted were few, as in the times of old, who had found favor with God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that </span><span class="c0">the outer court of the temple</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was cast out and should not be measured, because it was </span><span class="c0">given to the Gentiles</span><span class="c2">. Having measured </span><span class="c0">the temple and the altar</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;and those who were sacrificing within it, he heard that the court should be cast out to the outside and made wider, but not to be measured, as it was considered to have a superior measure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says that </span><span class="c0">the court</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is </span><span class="c0">given to the Gentiles</span><span class="c7 c2">, and it is held both within the temple and outside of it; and the New Covenant is held in place of the Old. For what is contained in it is fulfilled spiritually and truly in a shadowy manner, and it is different from the old one, according to the words of Jeremiah: &ldquo;Behold, the days are coming,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day I took hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.&rdquo; (Jer. 31:31-32)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He therefore speaks of the new covenant as </span><span class="c0">the court of the temple</span><span class="c2">. Then, the vision subtly implies that the Lord of the Old Covenant has also been established, the one who in the New Covenant has appeared as Christ and Ruler</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;[&#7936;&rho;&chi;&#8053;], just as it seems to Paul when speaking about Israel, &ldquo;for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them; and that rock was Christ.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:4) </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 1 Corinthains 10:4</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;From a spiritual following rock.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;The stone was obviously perceptible, the one from which water gushed forth for the Israelites, but it did not gush by its own nature; rather by the power of the spiritual rock present to it in operation, and following the need of the thirsty ones, that is, converting and transforming everything for their salvation and benefit, and being conjoined to their will; and sometimes fixing the water for them as if to let stones cross, at other times causing the heaven to bestow abundant food and nourishment on them, and at other times stopping up the rock into springs of waters. Therefore it would be reasonable to say </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;to drink from a spiritual rock.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;For this was the one that opened the perceptible springs into waters. But who was that spiritual rock, he says, that accompanied all these things, and according to each occasion&rsquo;s need changed and transformed the natures of things? Who? he says, namely </span><span class="c23 c8">Christ</span><span class="c18">, who even now shows to us similar and greater things. &ldquo;Following&rdquo; may be taken differently. For the intelligible rock, that is Christ, not only wondrously authenticated to them the things spoken, but also thereafter followed and was said to be doing things similar to these and greater, benefiting the Israelite, and also now following us the faithful. So that by continuity of the same providence, and of the same Lord and God, the miracles and benefactions of the Old Testament and those of the New are one.</span><span class="c32">&nbsp;</span><span class="c18">&quot;From the spiritual.&quot; Since he said the drink was spiritual, it was not something altered like the manna, but was ordinary water; and therefore, from the manner of its rising up he makes it spiritual. For the rock did not give it forth by its own nature. If that were so, it would have had to give forth before, but another rock operates the whole thing spiritually, which, he says, was Christ. &quot;Following.&quot; The &quot;following&quot; denotes the Spirit ever present with Christ, and working all miracles.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He called the New one </span><span class="c0">the court</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of the old; for the court is the beginning and entrance of God, but not the </span><span class="c0">temple</span><span class="c7 c2">. Therefore, he did not measure the court through which both it and those within it are revealed; for both the New one and those who have succeeded within it extend beyond the limit, the former due to their countless multitude, and the latter because of the elusiveness and height of the doctrines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That it is said to have </span><span class="c0">been given to the Gentiles</span><span class="c2">, it was indeed also given to Israel the new blessings; but since those among the Gentiles were superior in number to the distinguished ones from Israel, it demonstrated that the whole was from the greater number, saying that the court </span><span class="c0">was given to the Gentiles</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that </span><span class="c0">they will trample the holy city for forty-two months</span><span class="c2">, the city (not the temple), calling the church a </span><span class="c0">city</span><span class="c7 c2">, concerning which it has been said with glory about you: the city of God (Ps. 86:3), the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22), the mother of the firstborn (Ps. 86:5), whose names are written in heaven. (Heb. 12:23)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What then does the measure of the </span><span class="c0">forty-two months</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;signify? It clearly indicates that the time of the new order on earth will be brief, and that the end will soon come. The number </span><span class="c0">forty</span><span class="c2">, composed of four tens, is not perfect, nor is the number </span><span class="c0">two</span><span class="c7 c2">. From this, the argument shows that the new state will not endure long in the present life; therefore, the Scripture calls the final hour, and again the eleventh hour (Matt. 20:6, 9.), the time of the new era, during which the Only-Begotten came into the world; and in the future, it will be eternal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To say that those from </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Gentiles</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">will trample the holy city</span><span class="c7 c2">, that is, the church, means that those dwelling within it will be persecuted.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 11:3-6</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophecy for one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.

Now, however, these matters are being taught again, as if by way of correction, that Elijah the Tishbite will indeed come, as the divine Scripture clearly foretells. Malachi states, &ldquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the Tishbite before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, who will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.&rdquo; (Mal. 4:4-5) Furthermore, the Lord, speaking to Matthew concerning John the Baptist, says, &ldquo;If you are willing to accept it, this is Elijah who is to come.&rdquo; (Matt. 11:14)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Regarding another forerunner, we have heard nothing clearly anywhere, except that concerning Enoch, Genesis states that &ldquo;he pleased God and was taken away.&rdquo; (Gen. 5:22) The wise Apostle, speaking of him, affirms &ldquo;by faith, Enoch was taken away so that he would not see death, and he was not found because God had taken him.&rdquo; (Heb. 11:5)</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Hebrews 11:5</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot;By faith, Enoch.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;From him, the abolition of death was prefigured. Indeed, through Abel, the approval of the sentence was shown, but through Enoch, it is abolition. Enoch believed that God is a rewarder of those who seek Him; therefore, he was also pleasing to God: and to such an extent was his faith that what seemed contrary also appeared. For Abel, although he had pleased God, was slain, and God did not wish to overlook his death; therefore, Enoch was pleasing to God only by faith, believing in the reward of the good. For the sake of faith, therefore, he was pleasing, and because he was pleasing, he was taken away. </span><span class="c23 c8">&quot;he would not see death,&quot; </span><span class="c18">For he was indeed removed, and still lives: moreover, where and how, it is uncertain.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">An ancient tradition persists in the Church: after Elijah the Tishbite, Enoch will also come, preceding the second coming of Christ and proclaiming the imminent appearance of the Antichrist. It is said that they will come first and serve as forerunners, testifying in advance that the signs performed by the Antichrist are deceptive and that one should not believe the deceiver.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">Regarding these matters, the vision now speaks: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">that </span><span class="c0">they will prophecy for</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a certain number of </span><span class="c0">days</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;or reveal some secret number or the entirety of what is to come.

Zechariah, the inspired prophet, saw a lampstand with seven lamps above it and two olive branches, but the branches stood beside two golden oil dispensers, therefore saying: &ldquo;What are these two olive branches on the sides of the two golden oil dispensers?&rdquo; And he heard from the angel who was speaking that &ldquo;they are the two sons of oil, who stand before the Lord of all the earth.&rdquo; (Zech. 4:11-14) And that from this the prophet&rsquo;s use of the articles in the phrase &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; is confirmed; for this serves to indicate an agreed upon symbolism, except that here Zechariah called them &ldquo;two dispensers&rdquo; John called them &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">two lampstands</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo; That the two branches of the </span><span class="c0">olive tree</span><span class="c7 c2">, one from the Jews and the other from the Gentiles, have been interpreted as the two peoples is not unknown to the saints.

For &ldquo;the presence&rdquo; of the Antichrist will be revealed &ldquo;in the power of Satan through all kinds of signs and false wonders,&rdquo; as Paul writes in his second letter to the Thessalonians (2 Thess. 2:9), and these signs were intended to lead to assent and belief. Therefore, the two prophets who speak about him say that he is a deceiver and a fraud, and that he will use various signs to draw those who hear him into belief.</span><span class="c7 c25">&nbsp;</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 2 Thessalonians 2:9</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c34"><span class="c18">He said, The Lord will abolish the coming of the Antichrist to himself, whose coming will be according to the operation of Satan.

Therefore, it has been said that </span><span class="c0">the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of God and of His Christ</span><span class="c7 c2">, with the men who ruled on earth and the tyrannical demons having been destroyed and ceased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When this voice arose, </span><span class="c0">the elders worshiped God</span><span class="c2">, also offering their own thanksgiving, saying, &quot;</span><span class="c0">We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was</span><span class="c2">.&quot; The phrase &quot;</span><span class="c0">who is</span><span class="c2">&quot; is properly attributed to the Holy Trinity, and &quot;</span><span class="c0">who was</span><span class="c2">,&quot; although primarily said concerning the Father, is also applied to the Son, for the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit all exist eternally. Thus, the term &quot;</span><span class="c0">who was</span><span class="c7 c2">&quot; is rightly spoken of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the thanksgiving of the elders is dedicated to the Holy Trinity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That you say </span><span class="c0">you have taken your great power</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and your kingdom from those on earth, and that you alone now reign; but concerning the earthly kingdom that is perishing, it is understandable that </span><span class="c0">the nations </span><span class="c2">became </span><span class="c0">angry</span><span class="c7 c2">, as their dominion was overthrown, referring to the orders of both the demons and the unbelieving men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And your wrath has come</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">and the time of the nations has been judged, and the reward has been given to your servants, the prophets, and the saints</span><span class="c7 c2">. He says that you have long been patient with them, since they did not reject your goodness; now, that is, on the day of judgment, you have brought forth your wrath against them. And the things owed and appointed to the nations have also come and are present. What then? This was the judgment and the giving of retribution to the saints who had suffered wrongfully under them, and the destruction by the recompense of punishment of those who corrupted the earth, as if they had defiled it with their own sins. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that </span><span class="c0">the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple</span><span class="c7 c2">. He says that after these things were spoken, hidden blessings and, in addition, certain new mysteries were revealed to the saints; for this is the opening of the Ark of the Covenant. For he indicates that good things are hidden in the coming age, concealed from present human beings, as he says, &ldquo;what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man,&rdquo; which God has prepared for those who love Him.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:9) And again, that there is some mystery and a different knowledge unknown to those now living, the Lord reveals by saying, &ldquo;I will not drink again from the fruit of this vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.&rdquo; (Matt. 26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 22:18) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The saints were deemed worthy of these things, but to the sinners there came </span><span class="c0">flashes of lightning, voices, thunder, earthquakes, and great hail</span><span class="c7 c2">, which constitute the third woe, the future punishments known to us for the impious, and the word alludes to the signs from God.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 11.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1.

It can refer to the start of time (like John 1:1), the source of something, or a position of leadership, as seen in spiritual or political contexts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">3. The oldest manuscript of Oecumenius 146 (Messina 99) omits &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">the two olive trees and</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;. The critical texts of Hoskier and Groote both go with the oldest manuscript reading. Manuscripts 203 (Salonika Blat. 53) and 240 (Athos 770) both have it. Considering that Oecumenius uses that part below in his comments hints that it is the correct reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4. Oecumenius, in his commentary on that passage in Hebrews says, &ldquo;&quot;&rsquo;he would not see death,&rsquo; For he was indeed removed, and still lives: moreover, where and how, it is uncertain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5. &ldquo;The term &quot;beast&quot; [&theta;&eta;&rho;&#943;&omicron;&nu;] is used to describe the Antichrist.&rdquo; This would mean that Oecumenius understands this beast as the &ldquo;the beast that came out of the earth&rdquo;, that is, the False Prophet from Revelation chapter 13. Oecumenius is clear about this elsewhere in his commentary, but in a couple of places he is a bit obscure with the identity of the three figures. The three figures are the Dragon (Rev. 12), the beast coming out of the sea (Rev. 13:1), and the beast coming out of the earth (Rev. 13:11). According to Oecumenius, the Dragon is Satan. The Beast coming out of the sea is a fallen angel or demon that is second in command behind Satan. And Oecumenius understands the False Prophet as the Antichrist. Most commonly, it has been understood by many interpreters as the second Beast who comes out of the sea as the Antichrist, and that the False Prophet being another figure who is united with the Antichrist. Oecumenius has a unique interpretation here. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c16">CHAPTER 12</span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 12:1-2</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon </span><span class="c2">[&sigma;&epsilon;&lambda;&#8053;&nu;&eta;]</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; and she was pregnant, and crying out in labor pains and anguish to give birth</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Regarding the Antichrist, the vision that is more complete wishes to be recorded for us, of which a brief mention has been made in the preceding texts</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c2">. However, since the resurrection of this figure and his appointment by Satan as a pretext for the Incarnation of the Lord have occurred, having taken possession of and subjected the world, the Antichrist will be raised for this very reason. He will then attempt to lead the world away from Christ and persuade it to defect to Satan through apostasy. Furthermore, since the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s Incarnation was marked by His conception and birth in the flesh, the vision, leading to a certain order and sequence regarding the matters it is about to recount, has made the inception of the narrative start from Christ&rsquo;s conception in the flesh and has depicted the Mother of God</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;[&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&tau;&#8057;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;] for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For what does it say, and </span><span class="c0">a sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet</span><span class="c2">? It is said to refer to the mother of our Savior, as has been stated. It is reasonable that the vision is described as being </span><span class="c0">in heaven</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and not on earth, as a pure soul and body, like an angel</span><span class="c2 c11">3</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#7984;&sigma;&#8049;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;], as a citizen of heaven, as one who rests with God in heaven. For he says &ldquo;heaven is my throne,&rdquo; (Isa. 66:1) having contained and incarnated it, and having nothing in common with the earth and the evils in it, but entirely lofty, entirely worthy of heaven, even if it belonged to our human nature and essence [&omicron;&#8016;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf;]. For the Virgin is of the same essence [&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&omicron;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;] with us; for the impious doctrine of Eutyches</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c7 c2">, which also makes the Virgin of a different essence from us, along with his other doctrines, which are mere opinions, may be banished far from the sacred courts of the divine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What does it mean to say that she is </span><span class="c0">clothed with the sun, and the moon is under her feet</span><span class="c2">? The divine prophet Habakkuk, prophesying about the Lord, says that &ldquo;the sun rose and the moon stood still in its order to bring forth light,&rdquo; (Hab. 3:10-11) calling Christ our Savior &ldquo;the Sun of Righteousness</span><span class="c2 c11">5</span><span class="c7 c2">.&rdquo; (Mal. 4:2), or at least referring to the evangelical proclamation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Where it is said that, having been exalted and increased,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the moon</span><span class="c2">, that is, the Law of Moses, stood still and no longer received any addition; for no longer, after the appearance of Christ, did it receive converts</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&eta;&lambda;&#8059;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;] from the Gentiles as before, but rather it endured removal and reduction. Therefore, do not think here to consider the holy Virgin as the sun of the intellect; for in this manner the prophet calls the Lord concerning Israel, saying, &ldquo;Fire has fallen upon them, and they did not see the sun.&rdquo; (Ps. 58:8) But </span><span class="c0">the moon</span><span class="c2">, that is, the ritual according to the Law and the institution according to the Law, having been brought low and greatly diminished, is underfoot, defeated by the brightness of the Gospel. And rightly the one in the law called </span><span class="c0">the moon</span><span class="c7 c2">, since it too is illuminated by the sun, that is, Christ, just as the visible moon is illuminated by the visible sun. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But regarding what is being indicated, it would have been more appropriate to say that </span><span class="c0">the woman was </span><span class="c2">not </span><span class="c0">clothed with the sun</span><span class="c7 c2">, but that the woman clothed the Sun contained in her womb; yet, to show also in the vision that the Lord, who was being carried by the natural mother and is the Lord of all creation, was a protection, he said that He clothed the woman. The divine angel also said to the holy Virgin: &quot;The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.&quot; (Luke 1:35) For to overshadow, to cover, and to envelop are the same in power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And upon her head</span><span class="c2">, it says, </span><span class="c0">a crown of twelve stars</span><span class="c7 c2">. For the virgin is crowned by the twelve apostles preaching Christ together with her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it says </span><span class="c0">she was pregnant, and crying out in labor pains and anguish to give birth</span><span class="c2">; and Isaiah speaks about her before she begins to labor and before the pains of childbirth come, saying she escaped and gave birth to a male child (Isa. 66:7). Gregory, in the thirteenth discourse of his Commentary on the Song of Songs</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;concerning the Lord, says that her pregnancy remains without intercourse, and her delivery is without defilement. The birth was painless. Therefore if, according to such a great prophet and teacher of the church, the Virgin escaped the pain of labor, how then does she </span><span class="c0">cry out in labor</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">give birth</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;while being in </span><span class="c0">anguish</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;here? The statement is not a contradiction, far from it; for nothing could be contrary to the one and the same speaker addressing both sides. Rather, what is expressed here cries out and is troubled as you might understand. Until the divine angel spoke to Joseph about her, saying that the one conceived is from the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20), the Virgin was understandably distressed, having blushed</span><span class="c2 c11">8</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#7952;&rho;&upsilon;&theta;&rho;&iota;&#8182;&sigma;&alpha;] toward the one betrothed, and she was considering whether perhaps he might suspect her of secret unions causing her labor pains. Her distress and sorrow, he called, according to the laws of allegory</span><span class="c2 c11">9</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c0">crying out and anguish</span><span class="c7 c2">, which is not surprising.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For even the divine Moses, when he was spiritually encountering God and feeling disheartened, saw Israel in the wilderness surrounded by sea and enemies. It is said by God, &quot;Why do you cry out to me?&quot; (Ex. 14:15) Likewise, now the vision declares a cry concerning the sorrowful disposition in the mind and heart of the Virgin. But you, who are the pure servant and mother according to the flesh, of my Lady</span><span class="c2 c11">10</span><span class="c7 c2">, the holy Mother of God [&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&tau;&#8057;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;], having relieved your distress through your ineffable birth, also relieve my sins; for glory belongs to you forever. Amen.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">[Seventh Discourse]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Having completed in part the contemplation concerning the common Lady, the holy ever-virgin and Mother of God Mary, he presents to us another, saying: </span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 12:3-6</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And another sign appeared in heaven.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And behold, a great fiery Dragon appeared, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its heads were seven crowns. Its tail swept down a third of the stars in the sky and cast them to the earth. The Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child, it might devour him. She gave birth to a male child who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne. The woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her, so that there she might be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">As in the beginning of the vision considered authoritative, it is said that the vision, wishing to narrate more fully the matters concerning the Antichrist, begins with the conception and birth of the Lord, for whose sake that destroyer, the common enemy and adversary of all, is projected so that he might again enslave those gathered by the Lord. Similarly, it must now be said that the vision, desiring to recount the events concerning the Antichrist, makes another beginning prior to the previously mentioned start of the Lord&rsquo;s birth, one that precedes it, namely, the origin according to Satan, how he was cast down from heaven. Even in the subsequent vision this is stated more clearly, adding that he also plotted against the Lord, so that, as if a certain foundation had been laid at the beginning, the remaining narratives concerning the Antichrist and the deeds done by him might be built upon it. With these matters therefore previously explained, we must now turn to the examination of the words themselves. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it is said that </span><span class="c0">another sign appeared in heaven</span><span class="c7 c2">, as if the narrative were striking down the original evil, Satan, because although heavenly, he has become wicked through pride; he is shown in the heavens so that the rebel might see from what heights he has fallen to what depths.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And behold</span><span class="c2">, he says</span><span class="c0">, a great fiery Dragon</span><span class="c2">. The </span><span class="c0">Dragon</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is called Satan because of its crookedness; for this is how Isaiah also refers to him, calling the &ldquo;the dragon, the crooked serpent.&rdquo; (Isa. 27:1) It is described as </span><span class="c0">fiery</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;because of its bloodthirsty and wrathful nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its heads were seven crowns</span><span class="c2">. Nor did the prophet fail to recognize him as many-headed; therefore he says to God: &ldquo;You have crushed the heads of the dragon; you have given him as food to the peoples of the Ethiopians.&rdquo;(Ps.74:14) They say he is many-headed, with most of the </span><span class="c0">seven heads</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;signifying, as has often been said, the many authorities and cunning schemes he employs against humans, through which he enslaves them, for the </span><span class="c0">crown </span><span class="c7 c2">is a symbol of tyranny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The </span><span class="c0">ten horns</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;symbolize his greatest power. For the number </span><span class="c0">ten</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is perfect, and the </span><span class="c0">horn</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;is a sign of strength. It has also been said that &ldquo;my horn will be raised like that of a unicorn.&rdquo; (Ps. 92:10)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">As it is possible, one may come to know the one who appears in the book of Job. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it is said that by his </span><span class="c0">tail</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he drags </span><span class="c0">a third of the stars of the sky and casts them</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;down </span><span class="c0">to </span><span class="c2">the </span><span class="c0">earth</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For he conspired with himself to withdraw the greatest portion of the angels, persuading and causing those heavenly beings to become earthly, and darkness to overshadow the bright ones like </span><span class="c0">stars</span><span class="c2">. The </span><span class="c0">tail</span><span class="c7 c2">, however, reveals the nature of his final and backward failings; for previously, having perceived folly and rebellion himself, and having sufficiently nurtured this in his proud mind, he therefore came to corrupt the rest as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he said that </span><span class="c0">the Dragon</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth, he might devour </span><span class="c7 c2">her child. From the events concerning the Lord, it was carefully observed that the One who would break his dominion would be born, and the Dragon vigilantly awaited that when the Virgin gave birth, the newborn would perish. Therefore, he was not indifferent, but incited Herod to destroy the male child, who was both strong and brave; one who had no softness nor feminine qualities. For before the child could call a father or mother, Isaiah proclaims to us that &ldquo;he will take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria against the king of Assyria.&rdquo; (Isa. 8:4)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And who is this one born, the male, reveal to us more clearly, O John, who says he will </span><span class="c0">shepherd all the nations with an iron rod</span><span class="c7 c2">? You have plainly told us, O divine one, that our Savior and Lord is Jesus Christ; for it has been promised to him by the Father that &ldquo;he shall ask from me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession; you will shepherd them with an iron rod, and like a potter&rsquo;s vessel, you will break them.&rdquo; (Ps. 2:8-9)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it is said that </span><span class="c0">her child was caught up to God and to His throne</span><span class="c2">. The venomous Dragon plotted, and he persuaded Herod to destroy the children in Bethlehem, so that he might find the Lord among them. But by the providence of the Father, the child escaped the plot; for Joseph heard a divine warning to take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, because Herod was about to seek the child&#39;s life. (Matt. 2:13-23)</span><span class="c2 c11">11</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And </span><span class="c0">the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her, so that there she might be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days</span><span class="c2">. Therefore, was the child saved from the Dragon&#39;s plot, while the woman was given over to destruction? &nbsp;Not only that, but she herself was also saved by fleeing into Egypt, which was a deserted place and free from Herod&rsquo;s plotting. And there she is said to have lived and wandered </span><span class="c0">for</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">one thousand two hundred and sixty days</span><span class="c7 c2">, which amount to about three and a half years, with a few days less. For it was probably this length of time that the Mother of God spent in Egypt, until the death of Herod, after which an angel&rsquo;s message again led them back to Judea.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 12:7-9</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon. And the Dragon and his angels fought back. But they were not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The great Dragon was hurled down, that ancient serpent called the Devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Just as in a recapitulation of the aforementioned principle, it conceives an earlier principle, which was partly mentioned before, concerning the vision that is about to relate to us the events regarding the Antichrist; for the first principle among them is the fall of Satan from heaven. About this, the Lord also says, &quot;I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning.&quot; (Luke 18:10)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What then he says, </span><span class="c0">And there was war in heaven</span><span class="c7 c2">? The divine Scripture states that Satan rebelled against God, that is, he was stubborn and proud enough to raise his neck defiantly, and to contemplate apostasy. But God, being naturally good and patient, endured him; however, the divine angels, not bearing the arrogance of their master, expelled him from their company. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It is now said that </span><span class="c0">Michael</span><span class="c2">, one of the great archangels among the angels, </span><span class="c0">fought against</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Satan and those under him. But Satan did not prevail in the war against him; nor was </span><span class="c0">there found a place</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of refuge or even a dwelling for him in heaven, and he was cast </span><span class="c0">down to the earth</span><span class="c7 c2">, either suffering this visibly, or because having been deprived of his angelic and heavenly rank, he was cast down to an earthly mindset. Then, just as one defending himself, he blames God for his downfall, since it was not possible for him to harm God himself, he harms God&#39;s servants, the people, and tries to deceive and turn them away from God, thinking that by doing this he is harming the same Master.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 12:10-12</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, &ldquo;Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ have come, because the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night. And they have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives even unto death. Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and those who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, because the Devil has come down to you with great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time.</span><span class="c7 c4">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, the holy angels, revealing their own joy which they had at the overthrow of Satan, sing a victory hymn to God, saying just now: &quot;</span><span class="c0">Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c0">and the authority of His Christ</span><span class="c7 c2">, for He is Almighty; for by His cooperation we have overcome the enemy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the accuser of our brothers</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c0">who accuses them before our God day and night</span><span class="c2">, has departed from us. O the self-restraint of the holy angels; how they are imitators of their own Master. They call men their </span><span class="c0">brothers</span><span class="c7 c2">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">And why is this wonderful? Even the common master did not contempt to call them this; &ldquo;I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the church, I will praise you.&rdquo; (Heb. 2:12; Ps. 21:23) But what do they say about Satan? He has departed. He was stripped of his rank. No longer is there room for him to stand before God and accuse men. And they say that they resisted him on equal terms, having overcome the one who seemed invincible, as if daring even against God. They triumphed by employing a collaborator and helper in the precious blood of Christ, and by the word of the testimony given for Him, which they preferred over their own lives. Having therefore prevailed, all the angels of God rejoice, having been freed from the bitter region of Satan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Woe</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">to the earth and the sea, because the Devil has come down to you with great wrath, knowing that he has little time</span><span class="c2">. And if the descent of Satan were harmful to the earth and the sea, who would say why he came down?

But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the Dragon had spewed out of his mouth.

He pursued the woman because he recognized that the one born of her was mightier than he who had been captured, being envious of mankind&rsquo;s salvation through the Lord, and not accepting such a great reversal, that although he himself was cast down from heaven, men from the earth would ascend to heaven through virtue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it was said that </span><span class="c0">the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time, times, and half a time, away from the presence of the serpent</span><span class="c2">.

This, according to the earlier statements (see comments on 12:6), is Egypt. The prophet sought wings like those of a dove, so that, having flown, he might rest in the wilderness (Ps. 54:7-8); but to the all-pure Virgin are given stronger wings, those </span><span class="c0">of the great eagle</span><span class="c2">, he says. He says that the </span><span class="c0">wings</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of an </span><span class="c0">eagle</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;symbolize the divine visitation of an angel, who urged Joseph to take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, through whose visitation, as if by the wings of an eagle, they reached Egypt. (see Matt. 2:13-23) Having failed in this plot, which he had devised through Herod, the Dragon attempts another against the Virgin, aiming to destroy her son.

The term &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&tau;&#8057;&kappa;&omicron;&nu; (Theotokos) is the central title for the Virgin Mary in the Orthodox Church and means &quot;the one who gave birth to God.&quot; The term was officially established by the Third Ecumenical Council in Ephesus in 431 AD. This title affirms that Christ is both fully God and fully human. The Virgin Mary did not give birth to a mere human but to the Incarnate Word of God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">3. The term &#7984;&sigma;&#8049;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&nu; (from &iacute;sos + &aacute;ngelos, meaning &quot;equal&quot; + &quot;angel&quot;) is used in ecclesiastical literature and theology to describe a state in which a person attains such a degree of holiness that their way of life resembles that of angels. The word derives from the words of Christ in the Gospel (Luke 20:36), where He states that in the resurrection the righteous &quot;can no longer die, for they are like angels (is&aacute;ngeloi).&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The is&aacute;ngelos state does not imply a transformation of human nature into that of angels, but rather: Liberation from passions and earthly attachments. Unceasing praise and devotion to the worship of God, just as the angelic hosts do. Incorruptibility, foretaste of the state that the righteous will experience after the general resurrection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4. The claim that Eutyches presented the Virgin Mary as having a different &quot;essence&quot; from us is one of the central theological accusations against him in the 5th century. According to church history and the decisions of the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), Eutyches argued that after the union of the divine and human natures in Christ, the human nature was absorbed by the divine &quot;like a drop of honey or vinegar in the ocean.&quot; As a result, Christ had only one nature (Monophysitism), which was divine. According to orthodox criticism, this position led to the conclusion that Christ was not &quot;homoousios&quot; (of the same essence) with humans. If Christ&rsquo;s flesh was not truly human, then the Virgin Mary (from whom He received it) was considered by Eutyches to be a being not belonging to the common human nature. The Council of Chalcedon condemned Eutyches, declaring that Christ is &quot;homoousios with the Father according to divinity and homoousios with us according to humanity.&quot; The Church emphasized that the Theotokos (God-bearer) is truly human so that Christ could save human nature by fully assuming it from her. Eutyches&rsquo; position was deemed dangerous because if the Virgin Mary and Christ were of a different essence from us, then the salvation of the human race would be impossible, as God would not have truly united with human nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5.

Gregory of Nyssa, Homily on the Song of Songs 13. Gregory says, &ldquo;Christ alone entered this life by a new form of birth. Nature did not cooperate in this birth but served it. Therefore, the bride says that her spouse is &ldquo;white and ruddy.&rdquo; That is, he dwells in this present life through flesh and blood while having been begotten from virginal purity. His conception is virginal. His birth is undefiled and without pangs. His bridal chamber is the power of the Most High overshadowing the virgin like a cloud. He is a nuptial torch of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s splendor. His bed is free from passion, and his marriage is incorruptibility. The bridegroom born under such circumstances as these is rightly called &ldquo;chosen from myriads.&rdquo; He was free from birth resulting from marriage, for his existence does not come from marriage. No terminology pertaining to human birth can rightly pertain to Christ&rsquo;s incorruptible, painless birth because virginity and childbirth cannot apply to the bridegroom at the same time. As the Son is given to us without a father, the child is thus begotten without birth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">8. having blushed [&#7952;&rho;&upsilon;&theta;&rho;&iota;&#8182;&sigma;&alpha;].

In ancient texts and novels, the word is often used to characterize a heroine&#39;s emotional state or physical beauty. For example, it appears in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) in the Additions to Esther (D 15 or 5:1), describing Queen Esther as &quot;blushing in the perfection of her beauty&quot; (&#7952;&rho;&upsilon;&theta;&rho;&iota;&#8182;&sigma;&alpha; &#7936;&kappa;&mu;&#8135; &kappa;&#940;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &alpha;&#8016;&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9. &ldquo;to the laws of allegory&rdquo; [&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &tau;&rho;&omicron;&pi;&#8134;&sigmaf; &nu;&#8057;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;].</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">10.

But the first and the third are apparent to all; for the first is the ancient evil Dragon, the apostate and adversary of God the Almighty, Satan, and the third is the Antichrist. This middle beast, which now lies before us for observation, what is it? I think it comes after the apostate Dragon, Satan, and it holds the leading position among the rest of the demons; for many fell together.

It must be understood, however, that although the argument is presented in a hypothetical manner, it is not truly so; for it has nothing else to respond to later, but is proposed only in appearance, while in truth it is a simple persuasive example: and for this reason, it will be said: for if it were as it seems, it would proceed thus: If angels, having sinned, were not spared, nor the ancient world, nor Sodom and Gomorrah, would He spare these? Certainly not; or even in this way: He will not spare them at all.

But when the Lord had come and had openly said that the eternal fire is reserved and prepared for the Devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41), upon hearing this, he does not cease to lie in wait for the faithful, wanting to have many companions in his defection, lest he be ashamed to cling to this alone, applauding himself with this cold and envious consolation. </span><span class="c9">[Fragments of St. Justin Martyr, 4]</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Dragon</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is said to have given </span><span class="c0">him his power</span><span class="c7 c2">.

And this is what was spoken by Isaiah before God concerning Israel: &ldquo;for your sake my name is continually blasphemed among the nations,&rdquo; (Isa. 52:5) yet they also worshipped together with the prime evil one the Dragon, the cause of so great deceit and treacherous devices, in homage to the beast.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 13:4-8</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And they worshiped the beast; saying</span><span class="c4 c11 c15">5</span><span class="c4 c15">, &quot;Who is like the beast, and who can make war against him?&quot; And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy, and power was given unto him to continue for forty-two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of heaven of the sealed</span><span class="c4 c11 c15">6</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;from the foundation of the world</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From whom Israel&rsquo;s fame was routed; those who were seized by him weave praises to him, saying, &quot;</span><span class="c0">Who is like the beast, and who can make war against him</span><span class="c2">?&quot; He says that all have been defeated and fallen under his feet, </span><span class="c0">and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy</span><span class="c2">. Was it given by someone? It was given by those deceived and having worshiped him; for to boast arrogantly is pride. For what is greater than this? To say, &ldquo;I will ascend into heaven; I will set my throne above the stars of heaven.&rdquo; (Isa. 14:13)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">And just a little after that, he says, &ldquo;I will be like the Most High,&rdquo; (Isa. 14:14) as Isaiah mocks him, for these are indeed blasphemies against God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it is said that </span><span class="c0">power was given unto him to continue for forty-two months</span><span class="c2">. In previous comments, </span><span class="c0">the forty-two months</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;we understood it as a brief time</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c7 c2">. For all time is brief, even if it seems to be very long, when compared to the unending ages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven</span><span class="c2">. It is said that the blasphemies against God are of the apostate. By the </span><span class="c0">tabernacle</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;of God he means the holy angels because God dwells in them. For if it has been said concerning men, &quot;I will dwell in them and walk among them,&quot; (2 Cor 6:16; see Lev. 26:11) what would one say about the heavenly powers, that God has them as a dwelling? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him</span><span class="c2">. As I said earlier that he has taken the authority from the men who willingly bend themselves to his destructive power. Rightly did he say that all those </span><span class="c0">that dwell upon the earth shall worship him</span><span class="c7 c2">; for apart from the God-fearing Israel, which did not bear this, every remaining race of men and tribe has been found worshipping the destroyer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Of whom it says </span><span class="c0">whose names are not written in the book of life of heaven of the sealed from the foundation of the world</span><span class="c2">; the vision very securely predetermined this; for since it has been said that all the inhabitants of the inhabited world have worshiped the apostate Devil, there were nevertheless a few who were pure from this worship, both from the Gentiles and from Israel, such as Job, his four friends, Melchizedek, and the holy prophets of Israel,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">and those who are testified to in the Old Testament for godliness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says all have worshipped him, except these who, because of their godliness, and the precision and purity of their citizenship, are written in heaven, and are guarded by God; for this is signified by the </span><span class="c0">sealing of the book</span><span class="c2">. Concerning this </span><span class="c0">book</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;the Lord says to his holy disciples according to the divinely inspired Luke: &ldquo;nevertheless in this do not rejoice, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names were written in heaven.&rdquo; (Luke 10:20)</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 13:9-10</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">If anyone has an ear, let him hear.

If anyone prepared for murders, he will die the spiritual death in the worship of the Devil. Therefore, he says, </span><span class="c0">is the endurance and the faith of the saints</span><span class="c7 c2">. Therefore one becomes innocent of the slavery to the evil one, from which slavery may we all be shown to be free by the grace of the God who called us to the knowledge of Him.

For since the true one is thought to be Christ, it is not that he was given </span><span class="c0">horns like a lamb</span><span class="c2">. And since through every sort of wickedness he contends equally with the Devil, yet he is not the Devil, he did not say that he is a Dragon, but that he speaks as a dragon. Since therefore these things are so, the Word preserved for him the image also in the vision, and gives him a form not of a lamb, but </span><span class="c0">like a lamb</span><span class="c2">, neither of a dragon, but </span><span class="c0">like a dragon</span><span class="c7 c2">. For Christ has been called a lamb, the Devil a Dragon, but it was neither this nor that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it says that he e</span><span class="c0">xercises all the authority of the first beast</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in his presence. That is, he becomes the successor of the power of the Devil, and prepares all to worship him, </span><span class="c0">whose deadly wound was healed</span><span class="c2">. This has been said among the preceding. Now it must only be marked. For since he said that he has </span><span class="c0">all the authority of the first beast</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;before him, and first of all he named the Dragon the fiery one, whom the vision shown in heaven revealed, so that no one might think to say now that he received the authority as that of the first beast, I am not speaking about that first of all of all, but of him who comes after that one, yet before the Antichrist, whom the vision showed rising from the sea like a leopard (Rev. 13:1-2). For the wound of this one&#39;s death was healed, as stated above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it performed great signs, so that it even made fire come down from heaven to the earth in the sight of men</span><span class="c7 c2">. And the doing of signs and wonders by the power of the Devil is attested by the apostle; for after saying where &ldquo;the presence is by the operation of Satan, he brings upon all power and signs and lying wonders.&rdquo; (2 Thess. 2:9)</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 13:11-13</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;And deceives those who dwell on the earth by the signs that were given it to perform in the presence of the beast, saying those who dwell on the earth to make an image for the beast who</span><span class="c2 c11">9</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;had the wound of the sword and lived. And it was given it to give breath to the image of the beast, [that the image of the beast might even speak and make as many as do not worship the image of the beast]</span><span class="c2 c11">10</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;be killed.

For I will not say, it says, a foreign and unusual calculation, nor one named with concealment and doubling, but a calculation well-worn and known to men, which sums to the </span><span class="c0">number six hundred sixty-six</span><span class="c2">. This number also signifies many other proper and common names, and it also signifies these: as principal names Lampetis</span><span class="c2 c11">12 </span><span class="c2">[&Lambda;&alpha;&mu;&pi;&#8051;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;], Benedictus [&Beta;&epsilon;&nu;&#8051;&delta;&iota;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;], Titan [&Tau;&iota;&tau;&#8049;&nu;].

By form of address, however, the Victor [&#8001; &nu;&iota;&kappa;&eta;&tau;&#8053;&sigmaf;], for perhaps he so named himself, from whom the three horns, that is, having waged war against the kings, he will uproot. See what Daniel says about these things in his eighth vision: &quot;He says that attention was paid to its horns, that is, of the fourth beast; and behold, another little horn came up among them, and three of the horns that were before it were uprooted from its presence; and behold, eyes like the eyes of a man were in that horn, and a mouth speaking great things.&quot; (Dan. 7:8) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then the unstable one</span><span class="c2 c11">14</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;[&#8001; &#7952;&pi;&#943;&sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;], a wicked guide [&kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#8056;&sigmaf; &#8001;&delta;&eta;&gamma;&#8057;&sigmaf;], truly harmful [&#7936;&lambda;&eta;&theta;&#8052;&sigmaf; &beta;&lambda;&alpha;&beta;&epsilon;&rho;&#8057;&sigmaf;], ancient slanderer [&pi;&#8049;&lambda;&alpha;&iota; &beta;&#8049;&sigma;&kappa;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;], an unjust lamb [&#7936;&mu;&nu;&#8056;&sigmaf; &#7940;&delta;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;]; for perhaps by these names he would be called by those opposing him. But he will not only not be ashamed to be called these things, he will also take pleasure in such labels, so as not to be embarrassed to call himself accordingly. Stitching such wicked and God-hating choices together, the wise apostle says: &ldquo;whose glory is in their shame.&rdquo; (Philip. 3:19) Therefore, with many names having been found, the authority to attach the more fitting one rests with the one who wills it to the accursed one.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 13.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">1. Oecumenius says in his commentary on Jude 6, &ldquo;Those who had indeed received the honor of angelic position, since they did not remain in their origin, but corrupted the gift given to them from the goodness of celestial life, were reserved and kept for judgment or condemnation on the day of great and intolerable punishment. For this also now signifies kept. According to what Christ said: &quot;Who is prepared for the devil and his angels.&quot; (Matt. 25:41) And Oecumenius, in his commentary on 2 Peter 2:4 says, &quot;</span><span class="c9">But chains of gloomy</span><span class="c3">.&quot; This signifies the inevitability of condemnation. For with such chains, we certainly punish those condemned by us. But someone may say: Whence is such condemnation of the demons evident? From the demons themselves, for they plead in the Gospel (Luke 8:31) not to be cast into the abyss, as if all others might also suffer this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. The Greek phrase &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048; &tau;&#8056; &gamma;&rho;&#940;&mu;&mu;&alpha; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &#7985;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf; translates to &quot;according to the letter of history&quot; or &quot;according to the literal historical sense.&quot; In classical and ecclesiastical contexts, it refers to an interpretation that focuses on the factual, literal, and chronological sequence of events as they are written, rather than seeking deeper symbolic or allegorical meanings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">3. &ldquo;for the numbers ten and seven are perfect numbers.&rdquo; This specific phrasing is highly characteristic of Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BC&ndash; 50AD), a Jewish philosopher who blended Greek philosophy with biblical exegesis. Philo frequently argued that numbers like 7 and 10 were &quot;perfect&quot; to explain the divine order of the Torah and the creation of the world. This statement also reflects Pythagorean and Middle Platonic number symbolism rather than modern mathematics. In the ancient world, &quot;perfection&quot; (teleios) referred to completeness, cosmic order, or mystical properties rather than just the mathematical definition of a perfect number (a number equal to the sum of its divisors, like 6 or 28).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The Pythagoreans considered 10 the most sacred and &quot;perfect&quot; number because it represents the Tetractys (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10). It was seen as the number of the universe, encompassing all arithmetic and geometric proportions. Seven was viewed as perfect because it &quot;unites&quot; the spiritual and material worlds&mdash;often described as the sum of 3 (the triangle/spirit) and 4 (the square/matter). In ancient thought, it was also linked to the seven visible planets and the seven days of creation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">4. Oecumenius, in his commentary on 1 Peter 5:8 says, &ldquo;For the Devil does not cease, Peter says, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour; to whom you also resist with firm strength of mind. Concerning such sharp snares and the precise deceit of him against us, the holy Justin Martyr </span><span class="c9">(Fragments of Justin Martyr, 4)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;also brings forth the case, stating that the Devil did not clearly know the power of his punishment before the coming of the Lord, when the divine prophets had announced it mysteriously: just as Isaiah (14:4), under the persona of the Assyrian, tragically narrates the entire representation of the Devil. But when the Lord had come and had openly said that the eternal fire is reserved and prepared for the Devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41), upon hearing this, he does not cease to lie in wait for the faithful, wanting to have many companions in his defection, lest he be ashamed to cling to this alone, applauding himself with this cold and envious consolation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5. The oldest Oecumenius manuscript 146 (Messina 99) omits, &ldquo;saying, &lsquo;who is like the beast?&rsquo;&rdquo; 203 (Salonika Blat. 53) and 240 (Athos 770) has that section, therefore I added it in because that is obvious the correct reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">6.</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">are not written in the book of life of heaven of the sealed from the foundation of the world</span><span class="c18">.&rdquo; Some Revelation manuscripts read, &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">is not written in the book of the life of heaven of him who was slain before the foundation of the world</span><span class="c3">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">7. Oecumenius said in his comments on Rev. 11:2: What then does the measure of the </span><span class="c9">forty-two months</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;signify? It clearly indicates that the time of the new order on earth will be brief, and that the end will soon come. The number </span><span class="c9">forty</span><span class="c18">, composed of four tens, is not perfect, nor is the number </span><span class="c9">two</span><span class="c3">. From this, the argument shows that the new state will not endure long in the present life; therefore, the Scripture calls the final hour, and again the eleventh hour (Matt. 20:6, 9.), the time of the new era, during which the Only-Begotten came into the world; and in the future, it will be eternal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">8. In the Oecumenius manuscripts, the second &ldquo;into captivity&rdquo; is omitted, and literally reads &ldquo;If anyone [leads others] into captivity, he goes.&rdquo; Oecumenius probably had the original reading found in the Scripture text written by John because he does appear to support it in his comments, saying &ldquo;to take others captive will be taken captive&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9. In the oldest Oecumenius manuscript it reads, &ldquo;image for the beast, as it has the wound of the sword and lived.&rdquo; It has the conjunction &#8033;&#987;, not the correct pronoun &#8005;&#987;. Other Oecumenius manuscripts have the correct reading, which is the one that I chose to use here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">10. The oldest Oecumenius manuscript omits two small sections of the Scripture text, but other Oecumenius manuscripts has the full correct readings, which I placed in brackets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">11. That phrase describes the actions of the Egyptian magicians in the Book of Exodus 7-8, who used their &quot;secret arts&quot; or &quot;enchantments&quot; (like conjuring, illusions, or sorcery) to imitate the signs and wonders performed by Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh, trying to match God&#39;s power but ultimately failing, as their feats were limited compared to divine miracles, particularly after the first few plagues, showing God&#39;s supremacy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">12. The name Lampetis [&Lambda;&alpha;&mu;&pi;&#8051;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;] constitutes one of the historical attempts to interpret the number 666 of the Revelation, as recorded by Irenaeus of Lyons in his work &ldquo;Against Heresies&rdquo;. The word is the feminine form of the adjective lampetis and means &ldquo;the shining one&rdquo;, &ldquo;the radiant&rdquo; or &ldquo;the luminous one&rdquo;. In the literature of the 2nd century, the term is used rarely to describe the dawn (&#7936;&#974;&sigmaf;). Irenaeus mentions &ldquo;Lampetis&rdquo; as one of the names whose numerical value of the letters (isopsephy) equals exactly 666: &Lambda; (30) + &alpha; (1) + &mu; (40) + &pi; (80) + &epsilon; (5) + &tau; (300) + &iota; (10) + &sigmaf; (200) = 666. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">13. In Greek, a diphthong (from di- &quot;twice&quot; and phthongos &quot;sound&quot;) is a combination of two vowels pronounced together in a single syllable. The pronunciation of these combinations has evolved significantly from Ancient to Modern Greek.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Combinations of short vowels with &iota; or &upsilon; (e.g., &alpha;&iota;, &epsilon;&iota;, &omicron;&iota;, &alpha;&upsilon;, &epsilon;&upsilon;, &omicron;&upsilon;, &upsilon;&iota;).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">14.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The term &#8001; &#7952;&pi;&#943;&sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; is an adjective in the ancient Greek language that is used mainly metaphorically to describe the state of uncertainty and instability.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c16">CHAPTER 14</span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 14:1-5</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I saw, and behold, the lamb standing on mount Zion, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand having the name of his Father written on their foreheads.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I heard a voice from heaven like the voice of many waters and like the voice of loud thunder, and the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.

These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes.

How then does the Lord now appear from the vision standing on Mount Zion, as if from remorse? That the city of theirs and the temple and the whole people were left deserted, the Romans clearly showed, having burned the temple, set the cities on fire, laid waste all their land and sold even their mother-city</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&mu;&eta;&tau;&rho;&#8057;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&nu;] into slavery. But now to show the Lord as having ascended to </span><span class="c0">Mount Zion</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;is to show the ultimate return of Israel through faith, and that the Lord will dwell among them and receive them. For this is what was proclaimed through Isaiah: &ldquo;&rsquo;The Savior will come to Zion, and he will turn ungodliness away from Jacob,&rsquo; says the Lord.&rdquo; (Isa. 59:20-21) The prophet and the apostle agree with Isaiah; the one sings, &ldquo;For you shall make them turn their back in your latter end, you will prepare their face,&rdquo; (Ps. 21:12) and the one writes, &ldquo;when the full number of the Gentiles has come in, then all Israel will be saved.&rdquo; (Rom. 11:25-26)</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Romans 11:25-26</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c18">But when, he says, you suppose nothing great or marvelous about yourselves, mistakenly believing that you are wiser than others, learn briefly a most dreadful mystery, revealing the deep providence of God concerning all, which made evident the Israelites&mdash;except for the election (for he says, &ldquo;in part&rdquo;)&mdash;they being hardened and their salvation being put aside; God transferred this to you. Yet after all of you have been grafted in, grace will again encompass them all. For this very thing is attested by the Scriptural oracle of Isaiah. </span><span class="c23 c8">&quot;Partly.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Not entirely, he says. For there were also innumerable Jews who believed, and who were about to believe. </span><span class="c23 c8">&quot;The fullness of the Gentiles.&quot; </span><span class="c18">By &quot;the fullness of the Gentiles&quot; he means all those from the Gentiles who are about to believe.

And when will these things be? When I shall take away their sins. This is the covenant, as it were a sign, when I shall make worthy of the forgiveness through baptism. Therefore, since I have not yet obtained this (for they have been hardened), this will happen later. </span><span class="c23 c8">&quot;And this to them.&quot;</span><span class="c32">&nbsp;</span><span class="c18">so that no one of those already entrusted might think that the Scripture is fitting only for the Jews, he cites a sign by which it is shown that the prophecy is yet to come.

Previously he called the </span><span class="c0">one hundred and forty-four thousand</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;the twelve thousand believers from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. (see Rev. 7:4-8) Does he then also now speak about these? I do not think so; for neither did he name them with the article [the/&alpha;&#7985;], for he did not say &ldquo;the one hundred forty-four thousands,&rdquo; but only &ldquo;one hundred forty-four thousands&rdquo;; nor does he testify that they have also kept their virginity. For virginity was not held in special esteem among Israel, as later it was neglected among the Gentiles; so that those here named must be considered as mixed from both Israel and the Gentiles, and in fact mostly from the Gentiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But to have </span><span class="c0">the name of</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the </span><span class="c0">Father</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and of his Son </span><span class="c0">written</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;indicates that they are endowed with some divine glory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I heard</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">a voice like</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">harpists</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">singing a new song before the throne and the living creatures and the elders</span><span class="c7 c2">. The music pleasing to God and harmony of the song is indicated by the sound going forth as of those playing the harp; for if praise is not beautiful in the mouth of a sinner according to what is written (Sir. 15:9), certainly it is beautiful and melodious in the mouth of the righteous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">no one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth</span><span class="c2">.

About this matter was the wine spoken of, &ldquo;the wine being the wrath of dragons; and the wrath of asps is incurable.&rdquo; (Deut. 32:33) This </span><span class="c0">Babylon</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;first drank of the deadly </span><span class="c0">wine</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;herself, and thereafter </span><span class="c0">all the nations</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;whom she ruled she compelled to </span><span class="c0">drink</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 14:9-12</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice: If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The third angel</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;forbids people from worshiping the </span><span class="c0">beast</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and from receiving its </span><span class="c0">mark</span><span class="c7 c2">. For to worship someone as a god other than the true and living God is most impious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that </span><span class="c0">he</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;will </span><span class="c0">drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His anger</span><span class="c7 c2">. The glorious David also remembers this cup and the wine, saying that &ldquo;a cup is in the hand of the Lord, full of wine mixed undiluted, and he inclined from it to this: but the cluster of its vintage was not emptied; all the sinners of the earth shall drink.&rdquo; (Ps. 74:9) He says that the wrath of God is wine, not making the metaphor from joy but from darkening and from the change by which those controlled by the wrath of God are restrained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says of the </span><span class="c0">mixed </span><span class="c2">thing that it is </span><span class="c0">undiluted</span><span class="c2">. That is, mixed in an undiluted way; for the wrath of God has been mixed with generosity and goodness, it has been </span><span class="c0">mixed undiluted</span><span class="c2">; for there is no equality between anger and goodness, but generosity far outweighs. For if there were equality of both the wrath of the righteous and the goodness, not every living thing would have endured. Knowing this, the prophet said, &ldquo;If iniquity be observed, Lord, Lord, who will stand before you?&rdquo; (Ps. 130:3) But since goodness is diverse in the cup of God beyond righteous anger, he again spoke mysteriously, saying: &ldquo;Merciful is the Lord and just, and our God has mercy.&rdquo; (Ps. 116:5) Having arranged his justice in the middle, so that, by the surrounding compassion being constrained and not forgiven, it may work its proper effects; and this is proper to justice, to give to each according to merit. Having once remembered the </span><span class="c0">wine</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and therefore called forth the </span><span class="c0">anger</span><span class="c2">, he persisted in that course and named the </span><span class="c0">cup</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;the portion given by the hand of God to sinners. But someone may perhaps say, how do you call the mercy of God many in that judgment at the time when the vision delivered to us, having descended a little, declared that the punishments of those being punished are eternal?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For what does he say? </span><span class="c0">And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night</span><span class="c2">. To whom would one say this? &ldquo;Is it, O man, to be tormented eternally and not suffer according to due merit?&rdquo; For what? If someone is worthy of fire and darkness, and is condemned into darkness, and is punished merely in this, by not being in participation of God&rsquo;s goods, and is pained only by that, and not punished sensibly. But he says that </span><span class="c0">the smoke of torment that ascends</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;is the anguish of sinners, poured out below in weeping to the outside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, he says: </span><span class="c0">Here is the patience of the saints</span><span class="c7 c2">. He says that in that time of the Antichrist, and in that temptation it is shown forth. For as great as the danger and the affliction then, so great a need of perseverance. Then the discourse is shaped as if from a question. And who, he says, are those whom you call holy and patient? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says: </span><span class="c0">those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">For such people, even when trials and death are present, will set everything second to the faith and love of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 14:13</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, &quot;Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.&quot; And the Spirit says, &quot;That they may rest from their labors, for their works follow with them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Blessed are those who are not permitted to worship the image of the beast nor to receive the mark upon their forehead and their hand, and because of this are put to death; for these, having taken up the crown of martyrdom, attain the same end as the other martyrs.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 14:14-16</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I saw, and behold a white cloud; and upon the head</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;there was one like unto the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat upon the head</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c4 c15">, Send forth your sickle, and reap: for the time to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

It was truly a cloud, since the Gospel also says this, that which I have offered as demonstration above</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is of some angelic power; or it is written, &quot;and he mounted upon the cherubim and flew; he sped upon the wings of the wind.&quot; (Ps. 18:10) He calls the angels a </span><span class="c0">cloud</span><span class="c2">, because of the loftiness and exalted nature and worth of their being; or at least he calls the Mother of God [&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&tau;&#8057;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;] a cloud upon whom honor rests, and this mother according to the flesh; for so Isaiah likewise foresees her, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the Lord sits upon a swift cloud, and he will come into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt shall tremble before his face.&rdquo; (Isa. 19:1) Interpreting this statement, Aquila</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;says that the cloud is of light thickness; thick, as I think, because it is human and flesh, but light because it is pure and blameless and not burdened by any sin, and also because of the exalted and heaven-reaching nature of the soul. Therefore, you should understand the </span><span class="c0">cloud</span><span class="c2">; </span><span class="c0">white</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;because of the purity and the luminous [&phi;&omega;&tau;&omicron;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&#941;&sigmaf;] appearance of the things perceived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But the </span><span class="c0">crown</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;signifies the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ; for Christ is King of both the spiritual and the sensible, and the </span><span class="c0">crown of gold</span><span class="c7 c2">, from the precious things among us, sets forth the splendor of the kingdom. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And the </span><span class="c0">sickle</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;shown in his hand plainly indicates that in his power he sits over the end</span><span class="c2 c11">8</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;[&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&tau;&#941;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;&nu;] of the age.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And the angel said to him, </span><span class="c0">Send forth your sickle, and reap: for the time to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe</span><span class="c2">. And he says he </span><span class="c0">cast his sickle upon the earth</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;and it was reaped? A harvest is often spoken of in the Gospels; &ldquo;but the workers are few.&rdquo; (Matt. 9:37; Luke 10:2) There, the harvest signified the gathering of the faithful; here, it signifies the end of humanity, so that if any in them were chaff, unripe and worthy of fire, it would be delivered to the fire.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17" id="h.on1mg2grtvhb"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 14:17-20</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the altar, who had power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, &quot;Gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.&quot; And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood flowed out of the winepress even unto the bridles of the horses, by the space of a thousand six hundred stadia</span><span class="c2 c11">9</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The </span><span class="c0">angel</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;who has the </span><span class="c0">sickle</span><span class="c2">, who came forth from the heavenly </span><span class="c0">temple</span><span class="c2">, is himself also a minister and servant of the coming end. being heavenly and a minister of God, having come forth from the heavenly </span><span class="c0">temple</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;he is described. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And another</span><span class="c2">, it is said, an </span><span class="c0">angel</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;from the </span><span class="c0">altar who had power over fire</span><span class="c7 c2">.

Now the previously mentioned (Rev. 14:15) harvest represents the righteous and the sinners being gathered together at the same time, whose separation &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s winnowing fan will make, who will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor; and he will gather the wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire,&rdquo; as is said in the Gospels. (Matt. 3:12; Luke 9:17) But the vintage of the grapes plainly signifies the very lawless ones, from their drunkenness and the madness of the vision depicting them; and it is clear from these that neither the Lord deems them worthy to be gathered as the former, but some of the angels, and they are immediately cast out into the winepress of the wrath of God, not being granted defense nor asked, nor brought to judgment, as sinners also are introduced in the Gospels (Matt. 25:46; Luke 16:19-31), for whom the inexhaustible and unshared cause has become the reason of punishment. Concerning these things I think the prophet says that &ldquo;the wicked shall not be raised in judgment.&rdquo; (Ps. 1:5) He has appropriately called the punishment a winepress by the metaphor of grapes and the harvest. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says </span><span class="c0">the winepress was trodden outside of the city</span><span class="c7 c2">; for it was not lawful that those being punished should receive the returns of evils and defile the joy of the holy ones in the heavenly Jerusalem, which has been called out, through sympathy for those rightly punished, not that a great chasm does not separate the pious from the impious according to the words of the patriarch Abraham, which he made toward the rich in the Gospels. (Luke 16:26)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And blood</span><span class="c2">, it says, </span><span class="c0">flowed from the winepress</span><span class="c2">. He rightly said </span><span class="c0">blood</span><span class="c2">, to show that having spoken of a cluster of grapes he had spoken metaphorically, since indeed the sufferers and the thrashers were people, and they thresh with </span><span class="c0">the bridles of horses for a thousand six hundred stadia</span><span class="c2">, he says. Certain </span><span class="c0">horses</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of God are handed over to us in the divine Scripture, signifying angelic power that holds God&rsquo;s dominion; for he says in the Song of Songs to the bride, &ldquo;The heavenly bridegroom I likened to my horse in Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariot, the near one, my near one.&rdquo; (Song 1:9) And the prophet Habakkuk sings to God that he will &ldquo;mount upon your horses, and your cavalry is salvation.&rdquo; (Hab. 3:8) The Revelation says that </span><span class="c0">the bridles of these horses</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;are wet with the </span><span class="c0">blood</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;of sinners, not nearby but standing apart by length; and the whole statement is figurative, the riddle showing that the blood is so great. For those who travel the broad way are far more numerous than those on the narrow and pressed path (Matt. 7:14), just as those bridles might well be soaked from the horses set over punishment, whether of angels or whatever else.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 14.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">1. &ldquo;mother-city&rdquo; [&mu;&eta;&tau;&rho;&#8057;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&nu;]</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The word &mu;&eta;&tau;&rho;&#8057;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&nu; (metropolin) literally means &quot;mother city&quot;, combining the Greek words &quot;m&#275;t&#275;r&quot; (mother) and &quot;polis&quot; (city).

But if someone has overcome the slipperiness of his tongue, is he not suitable to govern the whole</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">body? For he who has conquered that which is easiest to slip, could by no means be overcome by that which is much more difficult.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">2. The oldest manuscript of Oecumenius reads, &ldquo;stone&rdquo; [&lambda;&#943;&theta;&omicron;&nu;]. Manuscripts 203 (Salonika Blat. 53) and 240 (Athos 770) has the reading &ldquo;linen&rdquo; [&lambda;&#8150;&nu;&omicron;&nu;]. Andrew of Caesarea, who was a contemporary of Oecumenius did acknowledge that some copies do in fact have &ldquo;stone&rdquo;. Andrew said, dressed in &ldquo;pure linen&rdquo; or, as some copies have it, in a &ldquo;pure stone.&rdquo; Oecumenius did in fact use the reading &ldquo;stone&rdquo; because he elaborated upon it below in his comments by referring to Christ as a &ldquo;stone&rdquo;, and then quoting some Scripture passages to support the interpretation.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c16">CHAPTER 16</span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 16:2-7</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And the first poured out his bowl upon the earth; and there came to pass a grievous and nasty sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast and that worshipped his image. And the second poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea. And the third poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the fountains of waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous are you, who are and who was and who is holy, because you have judged these things; for they shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. And I heard the altar saying, Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">These things could be understood in two ways: either as events that will occur sensibly at the time of the end, or allegorically. For when the Lord, addressing the signs of the end to his own disciples, set forth many of the evils that were then to occur, saying &ldquo;you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. And there will arise nation against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes in places; and all these are the beginning of birth-pains, and after a little while, for then there will be a great tribulation such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be.&rdquo; (Matt. 24:6-8) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If the things now said were to be interpreted as having happened when each of the seven bowls is poured out, the beginning of the suffering and the pains signified by the </span><span class="c0">sore</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;that arose from the </span><span class="c0">first bowl</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;would be the afflictions and anguishes that distress the souls of men then because of the reports of wars; and the </span><span class="c0">blood </span><span class="c2">of </span><span class="c0">the sea</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and waters plainly indicate the killings of those encamped near the </span><span class="c0">waters</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;in land battles, as is natural. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And I heard, he says, </span><span class="c0">the angel of the waters</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;speaking.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">Almighty is God and foreseeing of His creatures and sufficient for the benefit of all, so that there is no need for any collaborator for this; for where the mere willing is the sole work accomplished and where by the impulse of the will all things have been made existent, how could there be need of one who assists and partakes in the conferring of benefits? But since God is good and desires also to show kindness to the holy angels through assistance given to those who pray, for by aiding one who is in need one benefits not so much that other as oneself, and because there was no one among the angelic powers who was in want and in need of assistance from another, God appointed that those on earth who are in every respect needy of good should be provided for by the holy angels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, in previous passages (see Rev. 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14) we recognized angels as the guardians of the churches, and Daniel the wisest wrote that Michael, the chief among angels, watches over the tribe of the Jews. (Dan. 12:1) And now the Revelation recounts to us an </span><span class="c0">angel </span><span class="c2">appointed over the </span><span class="c0">waters</span><span class="c2">. For the earthly creation, composed of the four elements, has the air conjoined with fire, earth, and water</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c2">. For some among the heavens wished to be fashioned into a fifth kind of body, which they say it is ethereal and circular in its motion; the three elements, fire and earth and air, are lavishly diffused for the purposes of respiration and other common uses</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c7 c2">. That indeed fire, though the element is said to saturate the whole ether, is abundant and self-sufficient upon the earth, and dwells in its cavities and stones; and already some draw fire from waters in vessels lined with glass, whenever, when lifted up toward the sun, they become mirrors facing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But the earth is common to all, a mother and a tomb and a secure dwelling. Yet the water is not abundant for everyone: there is drinkable water in springs, fountains, wells and rivers, and the aerial water retained in the clouds in the heights gives us timely rain by divine command and nourishes every living thing on the earth. Since therefore </span><span class="c0">water </span><span class="c2">is not abundant for all, one of the holy </span><span class="c0">angels</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;has been appointed over it, so that it may be provided sufficient and adequate for the needs of those who lack it, which indeed often, through our wickedness, cuts off and causes scarcity, famines and the plagues that follow them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Of this </span><span class="c0">angel</span><span class="c2">, appointed by God&rsquo;s providence over the </span><span class="c0">waters, </span><span class="c2">I heard him say</span><span class="c0">: Righteous are you, who are and who was and who are holy</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">That &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">who are</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; then, shows the unending nature of God; and that &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">who was</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; the one without beginning; and He &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">who is</span><span class="c7 c2">&rdquo; holy is righteous in all things through all things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says </span><span class="c0">these things</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">you have judged</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c0">for they shed the blood of saints</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;may </span><span class="c0">drink blood</span><span class="c2">; for it is necessary that those encamped by the waters and the rivers in time of war should drink water defiled with blood from the slaying of the dying; to which an angel likewise sends up thanksgiving and those who circle the heavenly </span><span class="c0">altar</span><span class="c2">. For </span><span class="c0">I heard the altar say</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;this, indicating those who minister at the altar. May it be that we all, delivered from all the hardships spoken of, send up a thankful hymn to Christ, to whom be glory unto the ages.

That is, the memory of her former sins, when they persecuted and killed the saints, came before God; and </span><span class="c0">the cup of the wine of the wrath of God</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;is already interpreted; therefore there is no need to speak at length. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says </span><span class="c0">that every island fled and no mountains were found</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Islands</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;are said to be the churches from the nations, as the prophet says: &ldquo;The Lord has reigned; let the earth rejoice; let many islands be glad.&rdquo; (Ps. 97:1) </span><span class="c0">Islands</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;are also said, as those that have emerged and overcome the bitter and salty idolatry.

But where could the wretched ones flee from the presence of God, &ldquo;in whose hand are the ends of the earth,&rdquo; (Ps. 4:4) who measured the heaven by a span and the earth with a handful?

He taught that these elements are eternal and unchanging, but their various mixtures and proportions create everything in existence.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Aristotle (c. 350 BCE) refined this theory by adding that elements are joined through shared qualities: Air is hot and wet. Fire is hot and dry. Water is cold and wet. Earth is cold and dry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. This passage draws from the cosmological works of St. Basil the Great (specifically his Hexaemeron or &quot;Six Days of Creation&quot;), where he critiques and adapts ancient Greek theories of the universe.

Likewise the impious, even if they appear to exist so far as subsistence and essence, are not so far as to have the election and remembrance of God; and that this is so, the book of Genesis does not record the genealogies from Cain, (see Gen. 5:1-6:1) as it says that by reason of impiety they were not, but it declares their perdition in which they are about to perish.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">That is, the just punishment of Gehenna against him; for the Lord says concerning those condemned in it, speaking to Matthew: &quot;But fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.&quot; (Matt. 10:28) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that </span><span class="c0">those who dwell on the earth will marvel</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Not all, but those </span><span class="c0">whose names</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;are not</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">in the book of life</span><span class="c2">. And why will they marvel? Because the </span><span class="c0">beast was and is not </span><span class="c7 c2">and will appear and be destroyed; for those who had trusted in him will be most astonished at the change that will come upon him. For wishing to be ruler of the world and so showing himself, he will not only be deposed from his rule, but will also receive a worthy end for his wickedness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, he says, </span><span class="c0">here is the mind that has wisdom</span><span class="c2">. Therefore, so says the mind that has been made wise: let the riddle be known how it </span><span class="c0">was and is not</span><span class="c7 c2">, and is about to ascend from the abyss. For even for that which departs from being into non-being, the thing that is about to ascend again from the abyss seems to be contradictory, unless someone should apprehend it in some other way, as has already been said.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c4 c6">Revelation 17:9-14</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. and there are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes he must remain a little while; and the beast that was and is not, himself also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to destruction. and the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive</span><span class="c4 c11 c15">5</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;authority as kings for one hour with the beast. these have one mind, and give their power and authority to the beast. These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for the Lord of lords and King of kings is he, and those who are with him are called and chosen and faithful</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The seven heads</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says </span><span class="c0">are seven mountains, on which the woman sits</span><span class="c7 c2">. From this most clearly it is shown that what has been said refers to Rome; for it is related that she herself sits on seven mountains, and there is no other city. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says </span><span class="c0">there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, another has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain a little while</span><span class="c2">. Appropriately he regards the kings as the heads; for the kings are the headship of Roman dominion. What then? He said that of all those who reigned in Rome, only seven were heads of the beast; since these seven are most of all the beast, that is, the Devil, they divided his head against the Christians, having stirred up persecutions against the Church; of whom the first is Nero, the second Domitian, then Trajan, Severus, after him Decius, Valerian, Diocletian; for these among those who reigned in Rome especially persecuted the Church, as Eusebius says in his Chronicles</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c7 c2">, of whom he says five of the seven fell by death: Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Severus, Decius; and the one remaining is Valerian.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The other says </span><span class="c0">he has not yet come yet</span><span class="c2">, and that whenever he comes it is necessary that </span><span class="c0">he remain a little while</span><span class="c7 c2">. But another names Diocletian, after whom the reign over Rome ceased and transferred into the renowned city of the pious Constantine, Constantine himself having assumed the imperial power. And everything was reported very precisely to the evangelist, especially the matters concerning Diocletian, among which it is said also &ldquo;and whenever he comes it is necessary that he remain a little while,&rdquo; saying &ldquo;to remain&rdquo; in reference to the persecution against the Christians; for although he reigned twenty years, having begun the last two with the persecution, he resigned the empire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that </span><span class="c0">the beast which was, and is not</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And it </span><span class="c0">is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to destruction</span><span class="c7 c2">. And he appointed the Devil first and last and a fellow counselor of the seven. For how would this one not also be a ruler who made even the seven utterly wicked? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the ten horns which you saw</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom</span><span class="c2">. Concerning these </span><span class="c0">ten kings</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">horns</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the most wise prophet Daniel explained from the dominion of the Romans, saying: &ldquo;they will arise in the last times, in the midst of which the Antichrist will be raised.&rdquo; (see Dan 7:7-12) Therefore he says they have not yet received a kingdom but will </span><span class="c0">receive authority as kings</span><span class="c7 c2">. He calls them &quot;as kings&quot; because of the brief and shadowy nature of their kingdom. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then he adds that they </span><span class="c0">receive one hour</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;together </span><span class="c0">with the beast</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">He calls here the beast the Antichrist. For in the preceding passages he also called him accordingly, saying, &ldquo;And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb.&rdquo; (Rev. 13:11) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The expression that they would reign </span><span class="c0">for one hour</span><span class="c7 c2">, or the brief duration of their kingdom, is an allegory, or an indication of one year&rsquo;s time and change. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says that </span><span class="c0">they have one mind, and give their power and authority to the beast</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For though the ten kings will be opposed to one another in their opinions, yet in this they will have </span><span class="c0">one mind</span><span class="c2">: in giving </span><span class="c0">their power and authority to the beast</span><span class="c2">, that is, to the Antichrist. For they will be defeated by him, and he alone of all will rule over the rest. But even if they are defeated contrary to their will, since the ten suffer the same fate of defeat and removal, he said they </span><span class="c0">have one mind</span><span class="c7 c2">; therefore, he was saying that as by agreement and unanimity the ten will be defeated by the Antichrist. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says these </span><span class="c0">will make war with the Lamb</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">For before they are completely overthrown by the Antichrist, these will persecute the church about which the book speaks. But Christ will prevail; for though they are evil, he will deliver them over to the worse Antichrist unto death. And in another way Christ will conquer: he will grant his servants endurance unto death for the faith striving toward him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For he says they </span><span class="c0">are called and chosen and faithful</span><span class="c7 c2">, those, that is, who are servants of Christ. </span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 17:15-18</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And he says to me: the waters you saw where the prostitute sits are peoples and nations and multitudes and tongues.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And the ten horns that you saw and the beast, these hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her with fire; for God has put into their hearts to do his purpose, and to make one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman whom you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says </span><span class="c0">the waters</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;on which </span><span class="c0">the prostitute sits are peoples and nations</span><span class="c7 c2">, on which the city, that is, holds the kingdom. But how will Rome be laid waste by the kings? For we understood that this was indicated through the Revelation. Perhaps to them she will be fought over as a royal city and stronghold and populous and collecting tributes. Therefore in the war concerning her she is forced to suffer as the prize of victory laid up for all, being burned and laid waste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For God</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">has put into their hearts to do his purpose</span><span class="c7 c2">. He says that God, granting forgiveness, will persuade those who oppose it and those willing to take it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that they will </span><span class="c0">make one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast</span><span class="c2">. And just as from one mind they will be handed over as subjects to the Antichrist, as was said before (see his comments on Rev 17:9-14), </span><span class="c0">until</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">the words of God shall be fulfilled</span><span class="c2">. They, he says, will become subject to the beast until the punishment against the Antichrist also comes and the things spoken by the prophets by God are brought to an end, and upon him. More clearly, concerning the city about which the passage intends to signify, he brings forward that </span><span class="c0">the woman</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">is the great city which has the dominion</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;over all.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 17.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1. &ldquo;of the earth&#39;s fornication&rdquo; [&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &pi;&omicron;&rho;&nu;&epsilon;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &gamma;&#8134;&sigmaf;].

This is not Satan, but rather another fallen angel who was second in charge behind the Dragon Satan. Oecumenius also calls this entity &ldquo;the Devil.&rdquo; One of the names that Oecumenius offered was &ldquo;Lampetis,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the shining one&rdquo; or &ldquo;the luminous one.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">3. Oecumenius, in his commentary on this passage in Philippians says, &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">to all the saints in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c3">.

And he cried out with a loud voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great; and it has become a dwelling place of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird; for from the wine</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;of the fury of her fornication all the nations have been drunk</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c4 c15">, and the kings of the earth committed immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich by the power of her luxury. And I saw, he says, another angel having great authority</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says that this one is the illuminated and enlightens </span><span class="c0">the earth by his glory</span><span class="c2">. &ldquo;Babylon,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">has fallen</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo; He proclaims against her the sentence of God. He says that she is destined to suffer these things, and she became </span><span class="c0">a dwelling-place of demons</span><span class="c2">. For the demons hate mankind and are bloodthirsty; wherever they find places where the blood of men has been shed, whether in wars or by other deaths, they take pleasure in the occurrence and make their abodes there. And since most shall be destroyed in the city, as he said earlier, the place becomes from now </span><span class="c0">a dwelling of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit and every unclean beast</span><span class="c2">; for such creatures flee from company with men, and, occupying the wildernesses, preserve themselves from those who would ambush them and from the hunt of those who pursue. Such things, Isaiah the prophet likewise says concerning Babylon. He says also: &ldquo;There will the sirens</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;rest and there the demons dance; and there the one-horned centaurs will dwell and they will breed those scaly creatures in their houses.&rdquo; (Isa.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">13:21-22) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For from of the fury of her fornication all the nations have been drunk</span><span class="c2">. By &quot;fornication&quot; here he means their greed and love of money; for such is the manner of prostitutes. For those in the aforesaid city have indeed grown wealthy by </span><span class="c0">all the nations</span><span class="c2">, and after conquering them they ordained that they should pay tribute. And the </span><span class="c0">kings</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;say that the inhabitants of it have become partners and sharers of its love of money, and the </span><span class="c0">merchants</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;who trade there, it is said, </span><span class="c0">grew rich</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;from its wealth, that is, from its arrogance and unbridled, lavish and degenerate way of life, loading and disposing all kinds of cargo there.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 18:4-8</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I heard another voice from heaven saying, &ldquo;Come out of her, my people, in case you take part in her sins and lest you receive of her plagues; for her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.

How much she has glorified herself and lived delicately, so much torment and sorrow give her; for she says in her heart, &lsquo;I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.&rsquo; Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord who judges her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When the divine angels seized the city of the Sodomites to execute judgment upon its inhabitants and the neighboring towns, and more precisely, as seems in the writings of the holy Cyril</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c7 c2">, when the Son of God and the Holy Spirit moved there, &ldquo;since the Father judges no one&rdquo; according to the Scripture, &ldquo;but has given all judgment to the Son,&rdquo; (Jn. 5:22) the Holy Spirit being present with him, clearly and essentially as the vivifying spirit, then they say to the godly Lot: &quot;Save yourself, preserve your own soul; do not look back nor remain anywhere in the plain; flee to the mountain, in case you be taken up with them.&quot; (Gen. 19:7)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This is also what the Revelation now teaches us: since it is not possible in so great and populous a city as Rome that there should not also be slaves of Christ in it, he says to them, &quot;</span><span class="c0">Come out of her, my people, in case you take part in her sins and lest you receive of her plagues</span><span class="c7 c2">.&quot; For to share in her sins and plagues is to share with them; for the plagues are because of them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For he says </span><span class="c0">her sins have reached to heaven</span><span class="c7 c2">; as if to say that they even defiled the intervening air with their sins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore he says that God, having been very patient, has now risen for retribution. He therefore tells her to </span><span class="c0">render</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;sins </span><span class="c0">double</span><span class="c2">, although through the all-wise Moses God commanded us that &ldquo;one should not exact vengeance twice for the same thing.&rdquo; (see Deut. 32.41; Nahum 1:9) How then does he himself repay twice? </span><span class="c0">Double</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&delta;&iota;&pi;&lambda;&#8118;] does not mean double in the numerical sense, but that, being loving toward mankind and good, and far less inclined to punish to the extent deserved, God considers that he has repaid twice even when he gives back a portion; and not only twice, but sevenfold. And knowing this the prophet said, &ldquo;Return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach which they reproached you with, O Lord.&rdquo; (Ps. 78:12) From the petition for sevenfold vengeance he is asking God concerning the deserved punishment of the enemies, instead of which, he says, having been glorified and having squandered the providence of this present life, he has not fulfilled the divine will. </span><span class="c0">Render to her</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For he says, &ldquo;I will never be widowed of ruling&rdquo;; for this is the </span><span class="c0">widow</span><span class="c2">, the one desolate of the ruler. I will see no evil. Therefore, because of her loftiness, all evil will come upon her at once; for he says God is </span><span class="c0">strong</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;and will be prevented by no one from bringing judgment and punishment upon her; may it be that by the grace of the one who called us into his knowledge and hope in Christ he would make us all free; to whom be glory for the ages.

What then does he say? </span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 18:9-19</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication with her and reveled with her, will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her burning; standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, they will say: &ldquo;Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon the mighty city, for in one hour your judgment has come.&rdquo; And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their cargoes anymore; no longer will one find among their cargoes gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every citron wood and every vessel of ivory and every costly vessel of wood and of bronze and iron and marble, and cinnamon and spice and incense and myrrh and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and horses and chariots and bodies and souls of men. The fruit for which your soul lusted has gone from you, and all the bright and splendid things have perished from you, and they will never again find them</span><span class="c2 c11">5</span><span class="c4 c15">. The merchants who became rich by her will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning and crying: &ldquo;Woe, woe, the great city, clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls, for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste.&rdquo; And every shipmaster and everyone who sails to a place</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c4 c15">, and all sailors, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood far off and cried when they saw the smoke</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c4 c15">&nbsp;of her burning, saying: &ldquo;What city is like the great city?&rdquo; And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying: &ldquo;Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth; for in one hour she has been laid waste.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">How in various ways and vividly he wove the lament over it and the height of mourning.

The word &quot;chariots&quot; is a Latin term; for with the Romans holding sway it is not inappropriate for the divine evangelist to have used a Latin word. The Scripture has put it into Greek. For in Latin the chariot is called </span><span class="c0">rheda</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#8165;&epsilon;&delta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;], and they put a general plural ending in the case; and one ought according to the Romans to say </span><span class="c0">rhedioroum</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#8165;&epsilon;&delta;&iota;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&#8058;&mu;], as having Hellenized it he wrote a Greek ending, having said </span><span class="c0">rhed&#333;n</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[&#8165;&#8051;&delta;&omega;&nu;], so that the said thing may be such. And he says </span><span class="c0">horses and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">chariots</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and bodies</span><span class="c7 c2">, like also horses suitable for chariots, and bodies, that is, cavalry and made for riders.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 18:20-24</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has pronounced judgment for you against her.

Again, through the discussion in the narrative he lifts up the passion of spiritual Babylon; since these things are clear, it is not necessary to have them dwell among those who confess.</span></p><p class="c19" id="h.ri10tkfashh2"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 18.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1. For this reading, there are two differences between the oldest Oecumenius manuscript reading and the common reading found the Greek NT. Manuscript 203 is the closest to the most common reading, for it translates into English the same but the Greek is slightly different. The oldest manuscript reading omits &ldquo;of the wine&rdquo; [&tau;&omicron;&#8166; &omicron;&#7988;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;], and reads &ldquo;has fallen&rdquo; [&pi;&#8051;&pi;&tau;&omega;&kappa;&epsilon;], instead of &ldquo;made drunk&rdquo; [&pi;&#941;&pi;&omega;&kappa;&alpha;&nu;]. Oecumenius manuscript 203 reads [&pi;&epsilon;&pi;&#974;&kappa;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;]. I have decided to go with the reading from Oecumenius manuscript 203. But in the comments on the text below, Oecumenius omits &ldquo;of the wine&rdquo;, but does not read &ldquo;have fallen&rdquo; but the correct &ldquo;have drunk&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">2. Jerome of Stridon, in his commentary on Isaiah says this about &ldquo;sirens&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Hebrew word Thennim are called Sirens, which we interpret as either demons, or certain monsters, or certainly great dragons, which have crests and can fly.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c18">The Sirens are mythical creatures of ancient Greek mythology, dangerous bird-women (or later creatures with a fish tail) who lured sailors with their enchanting song and music, leading their ships to shipwreck on rocky coasts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Initially they were birds with women&#39;s heads. Over time, especially in post-classical art, they were identified with mermaids (with a fish tail).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3. Oecumenius omits &ldquo;as much as she has filled herself with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4. Cyril of Alexandria Adoration in Spirit and Truth 1 (PG 68:169-76).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5. The oldest Oecumenius manuscript reads &ldquo;and they will nevermore find her [&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&#942;&nu;],&rdquo; while the common reading in the Greek NT reads &ldquo;and they will nevermore find them [&alpha;u&tau;&#940;].&rdquo; Manuscripts 203 and 240 has the common reading, which I have adopted here, because that actually fits the context better, and was probably what Oecumenius originally used.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">6. The common reading is &ldquo;who sails to a place [&tau;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&nu;].&rdquo; The oldest Oecumenius manuscript reads &ldquo;who sails on the river [&tau;&#8056;&nu; &pi;&omicron;&tau;&alpha;&mu;&#8056;&nu;].&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Manuscripts 203 and 240 has the common reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7. The common readings reads &ldquo;they saw the smoke [&tau;&#8056;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&pi;&nu;&#8056;&nu;].&rdquo; The oldest Oecumenius manuscript and other witnesses read &ldquo;they saw the anguish [&tau;&#8056;&nu; &tau;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&nu;].&rdquo; I chose to use the common reading here because it is in Oecumenius manuscripts 203 and 240, which support the common reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">8. The oldest Oecumenius manuscript reads, &ldquo;And an angel took up a mighty millstone.&rdquo; Oecumenius manuscripts 203 and 240 agrees with the common reading, &ldquo;And a mighty angel took up a millstone.&rdquo; The only difference is that the oldest manuscript modifies the stone instead of the angel. The oldest manuscript uses &#7984;&sigma;&chi;u&rho;&#972;&nu;, while the correct rendering is &#7984;&sigma;&chi;&upsilon;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;. I chose to use the correct re4adibng found in Oecumenius manuscripts 203 and 240.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c16">CHAPTER 19</span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 19:1-5</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">After these things I heard a great voice of a multitude in heaven, saying, &ldquo;Alleluia!

David himself was also a forerunner of this betrothal when he said, &ldquo;Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear.&rdquo; (Ps. 45:10) And Paul too was a bridal attendant when he said, &ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s sake we are ambassadors,&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:20) that he might receive the bride, he says.

For even while philosophizing about the physical marriage, the wise apostle, adducing the scriptural statement that &ldquo;the two shall be one flesh,&rdquo; brings forward that &ldquo;this mystery is great; but I say it of Christ and the church.&rdquo; (Eph. 5:31-32)</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Ephesians 5:32</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot;This mystery is great.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;How great?

And because </span><span class="c0">he judges</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;righteously and </span><span class="c0">wars</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;against the sensible enemies on behalf of his servants, the prophet who speaks is witness, &ldquo;Give to the king your judgment, and to the son of the king your righteousness,&rdquo; (Ps. 72:1) that is, to Christ; for the Christ according to the flesh is the son of Solomon, to whom the Psalm is then assigned, going on &ldquo;to judge your people in righteousness and your poor with judgment.&rdquo; (Ps. 72:2)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That the same one also wages </span><span class="c0">war</span><span class="c7 c2">, he shows that he arms him militarily by saying: &ldquo;tighten your sword upon your thigh, mighty one, for your beauty and your splendor, and be strong, and show kindness and reign&rdquo;; then adding &ldquo;your sharpened arrows, mighty one: peoples will fall under you.&rdquo; (Ps. 45:3-5) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his eyes</span><span class="c2">, he says, are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a flame of fire</span><span class="c2">.

God says in the Exodus of the seventh day to the prophetic Moses: &ldquo;I am the Lord who appeared to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob being their God; and I did not declare to them my name, the Lord,&rdquo; (Ex. 6:2-3) as clearer than or capable of being conveyed by human hearing. Therefore, and as the Lord instructed the apostles to baptize those returning to the knowledge of God, he said, &ldquo;baptizing them into the name,&rdquo; and by saying &ldquo;name&rdquo; he did not hand over the proper names; for he did not have the strength to sustain their proclamation, but instead he delivered it in relational and nominative terms in place of the proper names, relational when saying &ldquo;into the name of the Father and of the Son,&rdquo; and nominative when also invoking &ldquo;and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19) Therefore, very securely and in the Revelation the divine name of the Only&#8209;Begotten is allowed to be unknown to all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says </span><span class="c0">he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood</span><span class="c2">; for in the vision the Lord also bore the symbols of the Passion and showed the all&#8209;holy body stained only with his precious </span><span class="c0">blood</span><span class="c7 c2">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his name is called the Word of God</span><span class="c2">. Do you see how, fleeing the divine name in the heavens above, the vision has now set a nominative in its place, saying &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the Word of God</span><span class="c7 c2">&rdquo;? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And heavenly hosts </span><span class="c0">followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen</span><span class="c7 c2">; for the Lord is both the commander of the heavenly powers and has so named himself, speaking as Joshua son of Nun. (see Jos. 5:14) Saying, &ldquo;I the commander-in-chief of the power of the Lord, have now appeared.&rdquo; (Jos. 5:14) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And the </span><span class="c0">horses </span><span class="c2">are </span><span class="c0">white</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;even to the holy angels; for they likewise take pleasure in those pure of men, since they are pure in nature and unmingled with any stain. And this is shown by that garment of </span><span class="c0">white and fine linen</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And </span><span class="c0">out of his mouth</span><span class="c2">, namely of the commander-in-chief, a </span><span class="c0">sword</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;proceeds. Therefore the divine prophet gives the sword to the Lord&#39;s thigh for use placed a little before (Ps. 44:4); but the vision, writing more precisely, presents it at the </span><span class="c0">mouth</span><span class="c2">. By which it is signified that by the word of God all things subsist, and whoever transgresses it in any way will not go unpunished, so that by him he may </span><span class="c0">strike the nations</span><span class="c7 c2">. What kind of nations? Those who join with the Antichrist against the servants of Christ and are placed under him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that </span><span class="c0">he shall rule them with a rod of iron</span><span class="c2">; for the Lord, being supremely good and merciful, would shepherd these nations about whom the word speaks with a shepherd&rsquo;s and consoling rod, &ldquo;leading them to a place of pasture and nourishing them at waters of rest.&rdquo; (Ps. 22:2) But since they have not willed this, they shall be shepherded with </span><span class="c0">an iron rod</span><span class="c2">, that is, with strict and deadly discipline. For whom the word does not reform, those it certainly submits to punishment. And because </span><span class="c0">the iron rod</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;denotes strict and punitive action, the prophet, intending to signify the rule of the Romans about which Daniel says, &ldquo;Arise, devour much flesh,&rdquo; (Dan. 7:5) said to God, &ldquo;You shepherd them with an iron rod: as with earthen vessels you will crush them.&rdquo; (Ps. 2:5) But when the season was favorable God shepherded by means of that; in the last time by means of this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God</span><span class="c2">. The Lord in the Gospels said concerning the heavenly Father, &ldquo;The Father judges no one; and he gave all judgment to the Son.&rdquo; (Jn. 5:22) It is therefore most fittingly said in the Revelation that he himself </span><span class="c0">treads the winepress of the fury of the anger of God</span><span class="c7 c2">; for by judgment and recompense of the wicked he fulfills the paternal will and becomes the fulfiller of the righteous anger of the Father. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And it is </span><span class="c0">written</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;upon </span><span class="c0">his garment and on his thigh</span><span class="c2">: </span><span class="c0">King of kings and Lord of lords</span><span class="c2">. The </span><span class="c0">garment </span><span class="c7 c2">is understood to be the flesh of the Lord; it is interpreted spiritually as flesh and blood, according to the holy interpreters who cite Isaiah: &ldquo;Why are your garments red, and your clothing like one who treads the fully trampled winepress?&rdquo; (Isa. 63:2-3)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But the </span><span class="c0">thigh</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;signifies the fleshly birth; for it is written in Genesis, &quot;all the souls that went into Egypt with Jacob are those who came forth from his loins.&quot; (Gen. 46:26) This, then, shows the riddle </span><span class="c0">written on the garment and on the thigh</span><span class="c2">: that the </span><span class="c0">King</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;of all is Emmanuel. For although the Word was united to flesh in hypostasis and endured the fleshly birth from the Virgin, he nevertheless was established as King and Lord of all (Isa. 7:14), both of those in heaven and of those on earth, not diminished in worth by the incarnation; for he was and is and will be God.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 19:17-21</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I saw another angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in midheaven, Gather yourselves together unto the great supper of God; that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, small and great. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the False Prophet that wrought miracles before him, by which he had deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image: these two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I believe this holy </span><span class="c0">angel </span><span class="c2">about whom the speech now is to be some sort of military herald of the divine host. And that he commands all the holy angels in heaven, whom he conventionally calls </span><span class="c0">birds</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;because of their elevation and ability to fly through the air, to share in the slaughter against the enemies; not that a single angel were unable to destroy the whole host of enemies, for that was clearly shown by him who in one night struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians (see 2 Kings 19:35), but so that all might become participants in the joy over the enemies. For I think he even says with the prophet, &ldquo;Did I not hate those who hate you, O Lord, and was I not hostile to your enemies? I utterly hated them; they became enemies to me.&rdquo; (Ps. 139:21)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And when he commissioned the angels flying </span><span class="c0">in midheaven</span><span class="c2">, he himself also stood in </span><span class="c0">midheave</span><span class="c2">n and proclaimed; for the sun is set in the midst of the seven planets, having three above it and three below it.</span><span class="c2 c11">8</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;Either therefore this, or that the proclamation was made in the light as in a spirit, and he was speaking of the doom of those murders about to be, for the spirit is an intelligible light toward God, as the prophet teaches; and making his words a father and saying, &ldquo;In your light we shall behold light,&rdquo; (Ps. 138:21-22) that is, we will see the Spirit in the Son. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says, </span><span class="c0">that you may eat the flesh of kings</span><span class="c2">. And he calls the feast over the death of enemies an eating of these and those; for therefore also the Lord names joy when speaking to his disciples and apostles: &ldquo;I have a food to eat which you do not know,&rdquo; (Jn. 4:32) calling in this way the gladness that is to come upon the believers. The </span><span class="c0">war </span><span class="c7 c2">with the Lord and the divine angels was waged by both the Devil and the Antichrist, for he calls him a false prophet of the beastly Devil, and kings who band together with them; but they were defeated sooner than speech.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">What do the divine Scriptures say about them?

By far it is preferable to give judgment by the sword briefly than by fire. Having begun once to speak about the judgment which he will give to the Devil, guarding the continuity of the discourse, he also recounts what he suffered in the incarnation of the Lord; and taking this as his theme, he speaks more at length about the Lord&rsquo;s presence in the flesh, and says: </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 19.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1.

A cherubic throne is set, and those who bear it aloft are ready and waiting, the bridechamber is furnished, the choice foods are made, the everlasting tabernacles and mansions are built, the treasuries of blessings are open, the kingdom of heaven has been prepared before the ages.

And he seized the Dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be fulfilled; after these things he must be released for a little while, that he may again deceive the nations</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For he continues in this way. Could it not be that the thousand years of the atheistic Greeks and the transmigrations of souls and the water of Lethe</span><span class="c2 c11">1</span><span class="c2">, and I do not know what foolish confusions the Revelation hands over to us, saying that </span><span class="c0">the Devil</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;will be </span><span class="c0">bound for a thousand years</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and then will be released and </span><span class="c0">will deceive the nations</span><span class="c2">?

What then does it say has been spoken to the prophet? &ldquo;That a thousand years are in your sight, O Lord, as yesterday that is past, and as a watch in the night.&rdquo; (Ps. 90:4) Therefore the </span><span class="c0">thousand years</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;are reckoned as one day in the sight of God. The same is said in the second epistle of Peter the inspired, who wrote: &ldquo;But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.&rdquo; (2 Peter 3:8)</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;This indeed is so.</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 2 Peter 3:8</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c2">For certainly to him who is infinite and the sea of essence unconstrained, nothing is extended, but </span><span class="c4 c15">a thousand years are just like a single day with him</span><span class="c7 c2">. Or rather, according to David, there is no multiplication of days: for he says in this way: &quot;A thousand years in your sight, O Lord, are like a day that has just gone by and like a watch in the night&quot; (Ps. 89:4): by watch signifying the briefest span of the night. For the night is divided into four watches: since the Lord came to the holy apostles in the fourth watch. (Matt. 14:25)</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Moreover the inspired Isaiah says that all the human life of the Lord is one day, saying: &ldquo;In a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.&rdquo; (Isa. 49:8) Not only that, but the Psalmist also calls that day both &ldquo;day&rdquo; and &ldquo;morning,&rdquo; saying on the one hand, &ldquo;This is the day which the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it,&rdquo; (Ps. 118:24) the joy of our salvation; and on the other hand singing, &ldquo;In the morning you will hear my voice; in the morning I will present myself to you,&rdquo; (Ps. 5:4) and I will look upon you; for our prayers are well-received when deemed worthy of the vision of God and the Father, through the Lord&rsquo;s mediation and reconciliation. And again concerning Jerusalem he says: &ldquo;God will help her with the dawn of the morning.&rdquo; (Ps. 46:5) And the day and the morning became the indicator of the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, as &ldquo;the Sun of righteousness&rdquo; shone upon us. For therefore Malachi speaks of him, (Mal. 4:2) and bringing us &ldquo;the light of knowledge,&rdquo; (Hos. 10:12) concerning which the divine light Zachariah preannounced, saying: &ldquo;a rising to us from on high has visited those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death&rdquo;; (Luke 1:78-79; see Zech. 14:6-7) to which the prophet also added, &ldquo;God said, the Lord, and he appeared to us to appoint a feast among those who burn incense up to the horns of the altar.&rdquo; (Ps. 117:27)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Having therefore prefaced these matters, proceed to the point in hand. Since it has been said that a day is reckoned by God as </span><span class="c0">a thousand years</span><span class="c2">, and conversely the day is called the Lord&rsquo;s sojourn on earth, he declares this day to be </span><span class="c0">a thousand years</span><span class="c2">, as if there is no distinction before God between a single day and </span><span class="c0">a thousand years</span><span class="c2">; in which day, that of the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, the </span><span class="c0">Devil</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was </span><span class="c0">bound</span><span class="c2">, being unable to resist the Savior&rsquo;s divine signs [&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#8055;&alpha;&iota;&sigmaf;</span><span class="c2 c11">3</span><span class="c7 c2">].</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Wherefore, perceiving this bondage of the spiritual realm, the true demons cried out, &quot;What have we to do with you and with us, Son of the living God? Have you come before the appointed time to torment us?&quot; (Matt. 8:29) But the Lord, while loosing their bonds, said: &quot;Or how can one enter the house of the strong man and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.&quot; (Matt. 12:29) Since, therefore, as has been said, we have conceived of the Incarnation of the Lord and his sojourn on earth as lasting one day and </span><span class="c0">a thousand years</span><span class="c7 c2">, this same number being mystically called in the divine Scripture without distinction, see what the Revelation says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I saw</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;another </span><span class="c0">angel descending from heaven</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c0">holding the key of the abyss and a chain</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c0">and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;having </span><span class="c0">seized</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says the </span><span class="c0">Devil</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was </span><span class="c0">bound and cast into the abyss</span><span class="c2">. As on a painted canvas the things that were spiritually affected by the Lord against the Devil are shown to the evangelist. For since the things that are spiritual could not be seen by a man, John being a human, the events are portrayed to him bodily: an </span><span class="c0">angel</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;having a </span><span class="c0">chain</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and bonds binding the </span><span class="c0">Devil and casting him into the abyss</span><span class="c7 c2">; for therefore also the book of Job, fashioning in a material sense the attempt of the Devil and the patience of God, made Job the one tested by God, and set down God as offering suitable words for request and giving along with the things that happened. Therefore, now you will perceive rightly in this way with me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says, </span><span class="c0">that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be fulfilled</span><span class="c7 c2">; for it was necessary that the Lord&rsquo;s abiding on earth should have some further element of providential oversight and guardianship, in order by this to prevent the unclean demons from working against men as they had done in the times before the Incarnation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And after these things</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">that he must be released for a little while</span><span class="c2">. What does he mean by </span><span class="c0">little while</span><span class="c2">? The interval between the Lord&#39;s incarnation and the end of the present age; for this is </span><span class="c0">a</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">little while</span><span class="c2">, even if it may seem great, being measured and compared with both the past and the future. For if in the &ldquo;last&rdquo; and on the &ldquo;eleventh&rdquo; hour (Matt. 20:6, 9.) the Lord our God appeared bodily according to the faith of the sacred writings, rightly is the time up to the end called </span><span class="c0">a little while</span><span class="c2">, after which once more the eternal and unending bond will be </span><span class="c0">bound</span><span class="c7 c2">. But even when he is released, bind again, O Lord, his plotting against us; for you are our King and to you belongs the glory forever. Amen.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">[Eleventh Discourse]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">The Revelation continues in the same manner.

And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">And in the foregoing, it was said in words that the vision, having once made mention of the Devil, as if keeping one section as a record for the narrative, shows not only what the Devil will do at the end of the present age, but also what he has experienced spiritually in the Incarnation of the Lord. Taking up that very section, it sets forth more concerning the Lord&#39;s presence in the flesh, as is now placed before us for contemplation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For he says, </span><span class="c0">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them</span><span class="c2">. He beholds the holy apostles, according to the promise made to them, &ldquo;seated upon twelve thrones and judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo; (Matt. 19:28)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">Which indeed will be fulfilled more perfectly in the age to come but also occurred to a degree at the time of the Incarnation. For those who had believed in the Lord and been transformed into countless good things judged those who did not willingly run to the faith, nor, having been led by the grace given to the apostles into devotion toward unity, did they ascend, but rather wove for him a cross and death. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says, that </span><span class="c0">the souls of those</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;crowned were slain because of </span><span class="c0">the testimony of Jesus and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;because </span><span class="c0">of the word of God</span><span class="c2">. He saw them sitting together on </span><span class="c0">thrones</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;and judging the rest of mankind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says that </span><span class="c0">those who had been beheaded</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;means those who were killed with axes. He speaks metaphorically about the dead who lost their limbs because of faith in Christ, and most of them endured this for that reason. For they were made outcasts, were subjected to countless insults, and had their possessions seized by theft, as the wise apostle testifies (see Heb. 10:34), since they wholly believed in Christ.</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Hebrews 10:34</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot;the plundering.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;It is great to bear the plunder of resources.

Not that even the mere thought that he should share the kingship of the glory with Christ is granted to him alone. (see 2 Tim. 2:10-12) Therefore it is also said concerning them by the prophet in the phrase &ldquo;the heavenly kings upon it shall be whitened in Selmon.&rdquo; (Ps. 68:14) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And concerning </span><span class="c0">the rest of the dead</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says they </span><span class="c0">did not live again until the thousand years are completed</span><span class="c2">. He calls </span><span class="c0">dead</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;those who have remained in unbelief, about whom also the Lord said, &ldquo;let the dead bury their own dead.&rdquo; (Matt. 8:22)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, the unbelievers did not live the spiritual life until the time of the Incarnation is fulfilled, which is the </span><span class="c0">thousand years</span><span class="c2">; for after these things they lived. How? By the visitation and presence of the Holy Spirit. For then most of the Jews will have believed in Christ, those who did not believe in him when he was present bodily among them. For the matter was administered in the most divine way, and beyond what human reason could have hoped for; for in the Old Covenant the Father was proclaimed and known, and by the Incarnation and the countless divine signs and powers the Son was proclaimed; but the Holy Spirit had not yet been clearly revealed to men. But only a word [&Lambda;&#8057;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;] about the Spirit existed in the Old Covenant, and there was no work that was evident and perceptible, nothing that most of all leads people to faith, as with the Son, although it was known to those who had advanced into the depths of contemplation. That indeed all things that have been done and fashioned by the Holy Trinity have been accomplished, and the Lord clearly presents this, where he says &ldquo;the Father gave me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak,&rdquo; (Jn. 12:49) and again: &ldquo;I can do nothing from myself,&rdquo; (Jn. 8:28) bringing the things that happen into the Trinity; and again to John: &ldquo;the Son of man cannot do anything of himself unless he sees the Father doing it,&rdquo; (Jn. 5:19) and he further confirms: &ldquo;if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God.&rdquo; (Matt. 12:28) But since, as has been said, the work of the Holy Spirit was not perceptible to people, he arranged that almost all people should receive faith in Christ by the visitation and power of the Paraclete</span><span class="c2 c11">5</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;and of God the Father, so that indeed the consubstantial and equal-to-all relation of the Son to the Father might become clear. It is needless to say that in the whole period of the Incarnation there are recorded not more than one hundred and twenty who had believed; for the Acts specify so many gathered together in the upper room. (Acts 1:15)</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Acts 1:15</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c18">One hundred and twenty of those who believed in the Lord were present.

All those to whom the Lord&rsquo;s teaching was sown have risen toward faith. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, it is said more precisely in the Revelation that </span><span class="c0">the rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years should be completed</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c0">This</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">is the first resurrection</span><span class="c7 c2">, namely the resurrection of faith; for the second will be the universal resurrection of bodies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Blessed</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;therefore </span><span class="c0">is the one who has part in the first resurrection</span><span class="c2">; for of the second resurrection we shall all partake, willingly or unwillingly.

What is it? It is the death of sin, that is, and the punishment of that time; for just as he said first and second resurrection, so also first and </span><span class="c0">second death</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And the first death is the physical death, the one having a separation of soul and body; </span><span class="c0">second death</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is the spiritual death, that of sin, about which the Lord also said, &quot;Do not be afraid of those who kill the body; rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.&quot; (Matt. 10:28) And the faithful are, he says, </span><span class="c0">priests of God and of Christ</span><span class="c7 c2">; for the faithful have all been shown to be ministers of the evangelical word, concerning whom the prophet, striking his prophetic harp, said &ldquo;he would appoint them rulers over all the earth.&rdquo; (Ps. 45:16)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And they </span><span class="c0">will reign with him for a thousand years</span><span class="c7 c2">, those of the Incarnation as has been often said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And when he says that </span><span class="c0">when the thousand years are ended</span><span class="c2">, that is, when the Lord, having fulfilled the economy of his flesh, has returned to the heavens, the bonds of the spiritual powers will be loosed from the Devil, and again he will </span><span class="c0">deceive the nations</span><span class="c7 c2">; for it has been said in what has been spoken before that the Lord&rsquo;s presence among men abolishes the activity of the Devil. But since the Lord has ascended into the heavens, it is the Devil who will exercise his ordinary and habitual powers, and those on earth will use their free will as they used to; for the Devil endeavors to deceive all. Some, however, are persuaded, while others, by resisting, contend against the evil one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But one might perhaps say: and why, being somewhat restrained and hindered in his natural impulse by the bodily presence of the Lord, was the Devil nevertheless allowed once more to deceive those on earth? For would it not have been better that he be bound, and that men remain unled astray? To this it must be replied: why do you rather ask of him the origin, how the Devil came into being, than, having come and transgressed, why he was not utterly destroyed, so that no opportunity against men might remain to him? And how, then, sir, were the contestants trained if there was no opponent at all? And how, moreover, was the strength of the athletes shown if there was no rival? For the careless are inferior in men and in pleasures, and, with no Devil present to incite them, are altogether foolish on their own; but those who are men of God and brave contestants would be wronged if their courage against the passions were not made public; as happens, that the careless gain nothing when Satan is absent, and the zealous are most greatly wronged. For Satan is in a manner a trainer of men, providing an occasion of crowns to those who struggle. For the sinful, who even without the presence of the Devil, through their own negligence make use of him instead of the Devil, are not even wronged, as has been said. Therefore, he benefits some unwillingly, and does no wrong to others, or very little. But you wished through me and you, the &ldquo;slaves of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 6:16) and stripped and fallen, that we be deprived by the activity of the Devil of the glory of patriarchs and prophets, of apostles and evangelists and those who endured even to blood for the witness of Christ and kept what is genuine for him, moreover of confessors and those shepherds esteemed good for the churches and the most steadfast abstainers and all that is righteous and perfected in the faith of Christ, &ldquo;of whom this world is not worthy.&rdquo; (Heb. 11:38)</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;So that the brave champions of virtue console the punishment of sinners whose brief crimes are judged, for one who succeeds is to be preferred by the God, even when ten thousand reject Him.</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Hebrews 11:38</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot;of whom the world was not worthy.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;This also encourages them. For if this world was not worthy of those who suffer badly for the sake of God, that is, all people and this creation itself, why do you, he says, wish to receive the rewards here for the sufferings endured for Christ? For being better than the world, do not seek anything in this world.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Both therefore were brought about in the fairest and most inspired manner, and that in the Lord&rsquo;s presence the impious impulses of the Devil were cut off, and after the Lord&rsquo;s ascent into heaven he was loosed for the testing of men. For if Satan had been allowed to display all his power while the Lord was dwelling on earth, he would not have permitted men even to be hearers of His divine teaching or to learn who is by nature and in truth God, or what religion is acceptable to Him, or what wickedness and what virtue are; indeed he would have prepared the cross for Him beforehand and begun it even before the teaching. Were this to happen, the incarnation of the Lord and so great and so honorable a mystery would have been incomplete and, rather, useless. But after these things were taught on earth under the bondage of the Devil, men were left thereafter to use their own free will and to contend with the adversary by means of those confessed and unknown ways of wickedness and of virtue. For he who knows the good and the not-good, by self-willed impulses chooses one thing or the other at any cost; but he who is ignorant of what he should do, as one wounded in a night-battle and unaware even that he has been struck, does not even know his own ruin. For in the case of one who has knowledge of opposites there is room for self&#8209;choice to select what he wishes, but for the ignorant there is no room. God made man free from the beginning and governed him by sovereign planning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That it is necessary first to know virtue and vice, so that the land may therefore be subject to free choice, see what the advocator</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;Moses says to the disobedient people of Israel in Deuteronomy: &ldquo;Behold, I have set before you this day life and death, the good and the evil,&rdquo; (Deut. 30:15) that you may surely choose the thing which is preferred; and again the same in Exodus: &ldquo;If you will indeed listen to the voice of my words and do them, he says, all that I shall say to you.&rdquo; (Ex. 23:32) And what says Isaiah, of whom the same teaching is cited at the beginning of his prophecy, speaking from the presence of God: &ldquo;If you will and will hear me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you will not and will not hear me, the sword will devour you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.&rdquo; (Isa. 1:19-20) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore, enough of these things. But since he said in what has gone before that the Devil will come forth to </span><span class="c0">deceive the nations</span><span class="c7 c2">, he now says what nations and from whom they are gathered: He says,</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 20:8</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">Gog and Magog</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4 c15">to gather them to the war.</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A </span><span class="c0">war</span><span class="c2">, however, against the saints. For having fulfilled the discourse concerning the salvific incarnation, he again returned from where he had gone out and related those things to us. He had gone forth from the Devil and the Antichrist; and from the defeat and punishment of the nations taken with them. Now I complete what was previously said insufficiently. He joins to the remaining nations those who have joined battle with the Antichrist; and </span><span class="c0">Gog</span><span class="c7 c2">, thus saying:</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 20:8-10</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And he went out to deceive all the nations that are in the four corners of the earth</span><span class="c4">; </span><span class="c2">among whom he says also</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, whose number is like the sand of the sea.

These will be certain nations and rulers of nations gathered around the end (see Ezek. 38-39); for now they do not yet exist, or they are some of the nations now existing called by different names in the divine Scripture. These therefore will resist the God&#8209;hating Satan against the servants of Christ.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will surround the beloved city</span><span class="c7 c2">, that is, the Church. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But </span><span class="c0">fire</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;brought </span><span class="c0">from heaven</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;will devour </span><span class="c0">them</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;all, and when the end has come, the prime evil Satan will be cast together with the </span><span class="c0">Devil</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and the Antichrist</span><span class="c2 c11">8</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">into the lake of fire</span><span class="c7 c2">, that is, Gehenna.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let the reader know that the present Revelation has handed down to us three things in the foregoing: first, the original evil Dragon shown in heaven; second, a beast rising from the sea, whom we understood to be second in command to Satan, but superior to the other demons; and third, the Antichrist, whom he also calls </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">False Prophet</span><span class="c2">. But concerning the second, the Devil, and the Antichrist it was said a little above (Rev. 19:20) that the two were </span><span class="c0">thrown into the lake of fire burning with brimstone</span><span class="c2">. Now concerning Satan, or rather the Devil, whom in the preceding passages he named the Dragon, he says that </span><span class="c0">they shall be</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">tormented day and night for ever and ever</span><span class="c7 c2">. Therefore, the one who met the vision perceived very precisely that the thousand years, during which the Devil was bound and cast into the abyss and then released, we understood to be the Lord&rsquo;s dominion and his reign on earth, in which the Devil&rsquo;s activity was suspended for a short time. For now he has shown that their punishment and that of those deceived by him is not for a thousand years, and that, far from being a release from evil, it is for ever and ever.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 20:11-12</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And I saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it, and from before his presence the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.

Which the Revelation called flight, signifying their change, so that they might not find a place; for where would the ruin they have rejected be found?

The Lord in the Gospels says that the way leading to punishment is broad and spacious, and that many go on it; but that the way leading to life is narrow and compressed, and that few are not only walking on it, but also finding it (see Matt. 7:13-14). Therefore, he saw many scrolls and one scroll; many in which all men are written because of the multitude of those contained, one however of life, in which are those chosen from the others and who are as it were flawless in virtue and walking every rough and upward road of virtue. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that each of those in the scrolls was </span><span class="c0">judged</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;according to his own deeds.

And they say that each of the bodies on earth is composed of the four basic elements, fire, water, earth, air, and that bodies dissolved by death return to those elements from which they were originally formed. Therefore, the fiery element in us returns to its kindred universal fire; the watery element to water; and the other components to their proper counterparts. If then these are dissolved and mingled with their own substances, how can that which has become indiscernible by composition be restored again to every one of the bodies which you call bodies, unless you would say that some arise from others rather than from their own? To these one might reply with the words of the divine Scripture: &ldquo;You are mistaken, O men, not knowing the power of God,&rdquo; (Matt. 22:20) by whose will all things were constituted, whose will alone accomplishes the work intended, as has also been said before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">For what is easier than for what is not to bring into being the substances, or having been produced and mingled either with themselves or with others to separate them again, and to assign to each its own? For the last indeed we perform too, often separating artfully the wine that has been mixed with water. Moreover the sun draws from the sea the drinkable and sweet by means of the vapors and exhalations, and lets go the heavy and earthy and salty and bitter. And first this belongs to God alone, who is able to do all things whatever He wishes. If then God brought the non-being into being, how would it not be easy for him to separate again for himself the things mixed according to the elements, and to distribute the same to each body, even if this is impossible for men? For just as it is impossible for you and for me to separate the illuminating from the burning aspect of fire, but possible for God, for &ldquo;the voice of the Lord has been said to cut off the flame of fire,&rdquo; (Ps. 29:7) so also the things that have been mingled are impossible for you and for me, but easy and effortless for God. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Now this marvelous assertion is presented to us by the present account of the Revelation, saying, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">The sea gave up the dead that were in it</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;from the sea.&rdquo; And this element of water signified every moist substance. The moist substance, then, he says, gave as much as was contained in it from the watery parts of human bodies. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Death and Hades</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">gave up the dead who were in them</span><span class="c2">. Calling the earth &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">death</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; because our bodies are dissolved in it, therefore also the inspired prophet, by indirectness, calls death &ldquo;earth of death,&rdquo; saying &ldquo;and brought me down into the earth of death.&rdquo; (Ps. 21:16) Therefore the whole earth gave what in it was our earthly part. In addition, </span><span class="c0">Hades</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;gave up the dead who were in it, calling </span><span class="c0">Hades</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the air and the fire because of their invisibility and imperceptibility. For the air, by its thinness, happens to be invisible unless it were thickened; and the fire that once dwelt in the woods is invisible, unless it were applied outwardly. Moreover, the element of fire, the ether, is invisible to us because it is darkened by the superaddition of much air. Or rather, he calls fire </span><span class="c0">Hades</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;because it imparts invisibility and imperceptibility to whatever it seizes; therefore many of the learned designate it as &ldquo;invisible.&rdquo; When therefore each of the elements had given up as much as of the human composition was in them, the resurrection was affected. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When this had taken place, he says, </span><span class="c0">each was judged according to their deeds</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c0">And Death and Hades</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">were cast into the lake of fire</span><span class="c2">; that is, the death and the immortal and incorporeal life of souls in the manner of death was taken away, once having been the resurrection and each soul receiving its own body; which, explaining more figuratively and hinting at their destruction, he said that </span><span class="c0">Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">This is also what the prophet Hosea does, saying: &quot;Where is your justice, O Death? Where is your sting, Hades?&quot; (Hos. 13:14)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says </span><span class="c0">the lake of fire, this is the second death</span><span class="c2">; for it has also been said above that the first death is the earthly death, the separation of soul and body, and the second is the spiritual death,</span><span class="c2 c11">12</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;punishment and retribution, which has sin as its mother. But those who are said to have been in sins and are not worthy of the inscription in life have suffered equally. And if he said that those who are in the middle of the sinners are cast into the </span><span class="c0">lake of fire</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;together with the Devil and the Antichrist, for he said this above, do not be surprised, for there too there is a varied punishment, just as with fever: one kind is burning and continuous, another is lesser and mild, even if all are called fevers; so likewise there you will perceive. </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 20.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1. In ancient Greek thought, the transmigration of souls (&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&nu;&sigma;&omega;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&#8061;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;) and the water of Lethe were key elements of a mystical, rather than atheistic, understanding of the afterlife, often linked to Orphism, Pythagoras, and Plato. While the general population feared a shadowy, permanent afterlife in Hades, these traditions offered a cycle of reincarnation where souls drank from the River Lethe to forget past lives before rebirth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. Oecumenius, in his commentary on 2 Peter 3:8 says concerning the thousand years, &ldquo;but a thousand years are just like a single day with him. Or rather, according to David, there is no multiplication of days: for he says in this way: &quot;A thousand years in your sight, O Lord, are like a day that has just gone by and like a watch in the night&quot; (Ps. 89:4): by watch signifying the briefest span of the night. For the night is divided into four watches: since the Lord came to the holy apostles in the fourth watch. (Matt. 14:25)&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3. &nbsp;The word &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#8055;&alpha;&iota;&sigmaf; (plural: &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;&iota;) derives from the words &theta;&epsilon;&#972;&sigmaf; and &sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#943;&omicron;&nu; and means the signs sent by God. Specifically, the term refers to: Divine Signs: Extraordinary events or phenomena (natural or supernatural) that are interpreted as manifestations of divine will or as warnings from the deity. Miracles: In ecclesiastical terminology and in biblical texts, it is often used to describe miracles, that is, acts that demonstrate divine power and intervention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4. Some of the Oecumenius manuscripts omit &ldquo;The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5. The word &quot;Paraclete&quot; [&Pi;&alpha;&rho;&#940;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;] comes from Greek and means &quot;one who is called to someone&#39;s side&quot; or &quot;one who is called for help,&quot; functioning as advocate, mediator, helper, or comforter. In Christian theology, it primarily refers to the Holy Spirit, whom Jesus promised to His disciples to guide them, comfort them, and give them strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">6. Oecumenius, in his commentary on Hebrews 11:38 says, &quot;</span><span class="c9">of whom the world was not worthy</span><span class="c3">.&quot; This also encourages them. For if this world was not worthy of those who suffer badly for the sake of God, that is, all people and this creation itself, why do you, he says, wish to receive the rewards here for the sufferings endured for Christ? For being better than the world, do not seek anything in this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7. &ldquo;advocator&rdquo; [&#7985;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&#8049;&nu;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;] Literally a teacher of religious rites and ceremonies, a high-priest, hierophant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">8. Here Oecumenius maintains the interpretation from Rev. 13 concerning Satan, the Beast coming out of the sea, that is, the Devil, and the Beast coming out of the earth, that is, the Antichrist/False Prophet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9. Oecumenius, in his commentary on 2 Peter 3:10 says, The word &ldquo;noise&rdquo; indeed means sound. However, the sound of this kind is proper to fire in those things that are fed by fire. Note, however, that it has said the earth and what is in it must be burned up, but not men, but only destruction has been said concerning the wicked or their transgressions. For the way of the wicked will perish, but the wicked himself will not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">10. Chapter 10, Oecumenius describes the variations of the &ldquo;scrolls&rdquo; in Greek. I also provided a footnote concerning this in note 10:1.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">11. Some Oecumenius manuscripts omitted &ldquo;this is the second death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">12.

But if they are immortal or incorruptible, surely they will also be </span><span class="c23 c8">new</span><span class="c18">. If, however, these are new, it is evident that a new creature has been born to be changed along with the establishment of men: corruptible indeed because of the corruptible downfall of men, but incorruptible because of the renewal of men.

And most trustworthy witness of these things is the divine apostle writing to the Romans and saying these things concerning the creation: &ldquo;for the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will but because of him who subjected it, with hope that the creation itself also will be liberated from the bondage of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&rdquo; (Rom. 8:19-21) And not only he but also the inspired prophet, singing concerning heaven and earth according to the testimony just cited: &ldquo;and all of them shall be worn out as a garment, and like a mantle you will fold them up and they will be changed.&rdquo; (Ps. 101:27) </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Romans 8:19-21</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot; For the creation&#39;s eager expectation. &quot; </span><span class="c18">That is, the intense and vehement anticipation.

Because, he says, having been created incorruptible, through the sins of men it has become corruptible, since we too, from incorruptible, became corruptible. Therefore the creation desires, he says, to receive the incorruption of men (and this will be at the resurrection), so that it too may obtain its proper incorruption. For when the man through whom incorruption became corruptible obtains incorruption, the creation will share in receiving its proper incorruption. The entire passage is a personification, both to indicate the excess of blessings and to show, as it were, that we owe more diligence to strive to attain such glory and incorruption than does the creation. For do not suppose that the lifeless and insensible creation expects or perceives such things.</span><span class="c23 c8">&nbsp;&ldquo;The revelation.&rdquo; </span><span class="c18">The end, when it is about to be revealed, who are sons of God and who are sons of the Devil.</span><span class="c23 c8">&nbsp;&ldquo;For creation was subjected to futility.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;That is, to corruption. For this was condemned because of our sins. </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;Not willingly, but because of him who subjected it in hope.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;He says this is the work of Christ&rsquo;s power, that even the things heard were subjected in hope. For it itself, he says, hopes for deliverance; therefore it was subjected in hope of deliverance. Then he explains to himself in what hope, that even creation itself will be set free. </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;For even creation itself will be set free from the bondage of corruption into the freedom of the glory.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Into freedom, that is, into the freedom of glory; that is, through us creation too will be incorruptible, just as through us it became corrupt.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says: </span><span class="c0">And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband</span><span class="c2">.

And Isaiah the prophet said a similar thing, saying &ldquo;death was swallowed up in victory, and again God took away every tear from every face.&rdquo; (Isa. 25:8) For if according to the divine apostle in that blessed Life of the Saints &ldquo;pain and sorrow and groaning have fled away,&rdquo; (Isa. 51:11) what kind of tear will remain for those who have escaped these things? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says </span><span class="c0">the former things are passed away</span><span class="c7 c2">.

And he measured its wall a hundred and forty-four cubits of a man, which is an angel. And the material of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.

The greatness of the city reveals both the magnificence of the saints and that, even if they are far surpassed in number by the sinners, nevertheless they themselves are not few in number, but are such as to fill so great a city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he measured</span><span class="c2">, says, </span><span class="c0">its wall at a thousand and four hundred cubits by the measure of a man, which is that of an angel</span><span class="c7 c2">. In many places, according to the customary usage of the divine Scripture, men are called angels. And this is clear from those passages in which Gabriel the Archangel is interpreted as a man of God (see Dan. 9:21). And the prophet said, &ldquo;You will save men and beasts, O Lord&rdquo; (Ps. 36:6): men indeed are called angels, beasts the men; for despite the mind of the angels we men happen to be irrational and brute. For he did not say &ldquo;men and beasts&rdquo; so that one might be proud, meaning true men and real beasts; for it was said to the apostle about the beasts, &ldquo;Is God concerned with oxen?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:9) Therefore the things called beasts by the prophet must be understood as men, and those called men as angels. </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 1 Corinthians 9:9</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot;Is God concerned with oxen?&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;So that no one may say, &quot;And what concern has that to do with the preceding matter about the oxen?&quot; he says, &quot;Is God concerned with oxen?&quot; For he is indeed concerned even about animals, but not in the sense of establishing a law for them. Rather from this he wishes to discipline us: that those who toil should not toil in vain, but should be nourished from their labors.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But the Lord also, according to Luke, called men angels, saying, &quot;Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, and you likewise are like men awaiting their Lord, when he will be released from the wedding.&rdquo; (Luke 12:35-36) Since therefore in many respects men are called angels from above; and they have eyes toward God. For this reason he says here a measure of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;man which is an angel</span><span class="c7 c2">. The saying hints that the divine is altogether incomprehensible, for we have conceived Christ as a wall of the city in the things before, and still more by contemplation of the majesty of God men become angels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Therefore the </span><span class="c0">wall</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;of the city was measured by an angelic rod and not by a human one. And the secret who is to have the number of the rods is by the wisdom of the angels, who also measured it knowingly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says that the inner structure of its wall is </span><span class="c0">jasper</span><span class="c7 c2">. Already we have received jasper as the symbol of the incorruptible and life-giving Christ. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says </span><span class="c0">the city is pure gold</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c0">like clear glass</span><span class="c2">.

As for the foundation of the wall, the Lord is a </span><span class="c0">wall</span><span class="c2">, as has been said many times. We have spoken of the holy apostles in the foregoing. As though Christ rests in their teaching and has mounted upon them according to the promise given, in which he also says, &ldquo;and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.&rdquo; (Matt. 28:20) Therefore these are the </span><span class="c0">foundations</span><span class="c2">, that is, the apostles, in every excellence; for the precious stones denote excellence, they are </span><span class="c0">adorned</span><span class="c2">; for by deed they became pure through the preaching and through the struggles for Christ and by their favorable nature toward him even unto blood. And if anyone will wish to be precise even about the stones, such a kind of vision may be found, but a little from above will be enough. The high priests according to the law of Moses were variously attired with a kind of tunic and a shoulder-covering and a mitre and a breastplate, girded and surrounded by other things (see Ex. 29:5-6), both awe and astonishment, moreover exhibiting a secret symbolism through their form. And among them was also the saying of judgment (see Ex. 28:15), which was carried upon the shoulder-covering by a woven work in various fashion. The form of the saying was a double breastplate, a small and square thing (Ex. 28:16), in which twelve stones were set in four rows with the names of the sons of Israel; some of these stones indeed were also placed in the </span><span class="c0">foundations of the wall</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;there, others were corner-stones and not placed in those. For in the breastplate of judgments there are borne eight stones corresponding to the foundations there: jacinth; sapphire; emerald; sardius; chrysolite; beryl; topaz; amethyst; and four of the stones in the foundations are not numbered with those in the breastplate of judgment. They are these: sardonyx; chrysoprase; hyacinth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And there were also the </span><span class="c0">gates</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of the </span><span class="c0">city</span><span class="c2">, which we likewise received as the apostles, </span><span class="c0">each one from a single</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">pearl</span><span class="c7 c2">. Therefore the pearl is now set as new, not itself numbered among the stones of the list, and it is possible to see that the newly named ones are rather more valuable than those placed in the list in the old book; by which is indicated that the holy apostles have knowledge of the Old Covenant and approve of the decrees established in that, and the wise apostle could say, &ldquo;having been made righteous according to the law, I am blameless&rdquo; (Philip. 3:6) and also approved in the precepts of the New Covenant, and that its knowledge has been enriched, which was much clearer and somewhat more precious than the knowledge in the Old, if indeed the things in the law were a shadow, and the things in the New were truth; for this is hinted by the mingling set forth: both the precious stones of the Old and the New are in the foundations of the city, which, as has been said, testify to the apostles. </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on Philippians 3:6</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;Out of zeal.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;For one may be a Pharisee, yet not a zealot. </span><span class="c23 c8">According to the righteousness in the law.</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Since the Jews also persecuted the Church, not out of zeal for God but out of love of authority, and this is evident.

For he, he says, knew us and drew us to himself. </span><span class="c23 c8">&ldquo;Even as I was known.&rdquo;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Instead of &ldquo;I was known,&rdquo; meaning precisely and completely. For on this account, he says, I too was known at the beginning, that I might know him also, as far as it is possible for a human, completely and precisely the Master who knew me.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But naturally one might ask, what then? We have already invoked God the Almighty, and the Father of the Lord and of the Lamb, the Son of God; shall we not also recall the Holy Spirit? One must say to him: saying, &ldquo;O this one,&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">the Lord</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">God</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;named the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, for God did so; and again saying, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the Lord God Almighty</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; he signified the Holy Trinity by the three names. But someone might also ask this: why, then, having been reminded of the venerable Trinity by the saying &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the Lord God Almighty</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">are its temple</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; is the </span><span class="c0">Lamb</span><span class="c2">, who is Christ, counted to us from the outside, so that we should no longer conceive a Trinity? May it not be so, I should say to him. For we are not taught so, but a memory is borne of both the Holy Trinity and of the </span><span class="c0">Lamb</span><span class="c2">, the sense of the statement signifying that the one who was incarnate is of the Holy Trinity, and that after the flesh the Son fills the Holy Trinity and is not now in heaven separated from the flesh. For he indicated the Son incarnate by periphrasis both by &ldquo;God who is the Son,&rdquo; and by &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the Lamb</span><span class="c7 c2">,&rdquo; which again is the same Christ incarnate, consubstantial with us and enlivened intelligibly; in whom the Word is united to the particular flesh according to hypostasis.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c17"><span class="c6 c4">Revelation 21:23-25</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c15">And the city needs neither sun nor moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has lit it, and its lamp is the Lamb.

For in that time the saints perceive, at the end of the spiritual things, no need of sensible light. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;it says </span><span class="c0">the nations will walk by its light</span><span class="c2">. Not only the </span><span class="c0">nations</span><span class="c7 c2">, but also the saints from Israel who have believed.

Oecumenius uses the word &ldquo;cowardly [&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf;]&rdquo; in his comments below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. The oldest Oecumenius manuscript reads &ldquo;fifteen.&rdquo; Manuscripts 203 and 240 have &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;, which is the correct reading. Oecumenius also has &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; in the comments below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3. The oldest Oecumenius manuscript omits &ldquo;and from the west three gates.&rdquo; Manuscripts 203 and 240 has that reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">4. Oecumenius, in his commentary on the epistle to the Hebrews reads&hellip; There is fire, for this reason, that God may appear more fearsome to those who were delivering the law. &quot;</span><span class="c9">And to darkness and gloom</span><span class="c18">.&quot; </span><span class="c9">Darkness and gloom</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;signify the shadow of the Old Testament. For if those were figures, it is evident that until the truth came, the figures were obscure, while it was not known what they signified. Moreover, </span><span class="c9">darkness</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;also signifies the invisibility of God. &quot;</span><span class="c9">and to darkness</span><span class="c3">,&quot; he says, &quot;under his feet.&quot; (Ps. 17:10)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">&quot;</span><span class="c9">and a storm</span><span class="c3">.&quot; By the word, storm, he excites them when they were sluggish. Indeed, the storm is a twisting of the wind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">And the </span><span class="c9">trumpet</span><span class="c3">, however, as if in the presence of the king; for this will be in the second coming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">&quot;</span><span class="c9">and the voice of words</span><span class="c18">.&quot; For Moses spoke, and God answered. Indeed, it was necessary for </span><span class="c9">the voice</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of God to be formed (Ex. 19:19), so that the lawgiving would be worthy of faith, and it would not be thought to be from Moses, through whom God was about to bring the law.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">&quot;</span><span class="c9">For they could not bear what was commanded</span><span class="c3">.&quot; He stated the reason for the excuse, because they could not bear what was being defined, that is, what was being commanded or said. Indeed, they said to Moses: &quot;Speak to us, and let not God speak to us.&quot; (Ex. 20:19)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">&quot;</span><span class="c9">Even if a beast touched the mountain</span><span class="c3">.&quot; Such was the terror that if the beast touched the mountain, it was stoned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">&quot;</span><span class="c9">And so terrifying was the sight</span><span class="c3">.&quot; It wishes to show that the New Testament also excels in relation to the Old. For indeed, even if the Old had nothing of this kind that the New has, it was to be feared in some way; however, the New, having perfection, is gentle and without terror. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">&quot;</span><span class="c9">that Moses said, &quot;I am exceedingly afraid and trembling</span><span class="c18">..&quot; This was also said by the one who was about to enter into darkness&hellip;.&quot;</span><span class="c9">But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to multitudes of angels</span><span class="c18">.&rdquo; Instead of the people of Judah, angels are present. And he says there is a </span><span class="c9">festive gathering</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;among the </span><span class="c9">multitude of angels</span><span class="c18">. He also speaks </span><span class="c9">of the firstborn</span><span class="c3">, the faithful, whose names are written in the book of life. For this is what the Lord also says to the disciples: &ldquo;Rejoice because your names are written in heaven.&quot; (Luke 10:20) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] He calls the </span><span class="c9">firstborn</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;holy, who have something excellent beyond other faithful ones who have received adoption from the firstborn who are among us, who by the right of the firstborn have some special birthrights.

Oecumenius makes a very similar statement in his commentary on Hebrews 2:2, saying, &ldquo;But he says, this is of such a nature.

The interpretation of &quot;Israel&quot; as &quot;the mind seeing God&quot; (Greek: nous hor&#333;n theon) is a specific theological interpretation, particularly by Early Church Fathers like Origen, suggesting a spiritual, not just physical, people who have spiritual insight, contrasting with earthly wisdom, even though the common biblical name origin is from Jacob&#39;s wrestling with God (&quot;struggled with God and prevailed&quot;).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">8.

And there shall be no more curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him; and they shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads; and night shall be no more, and they will have no need of the light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will illuminate them, and they will reign for ever and ever. Amen</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he showed me</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb in the midst of the city&#39;s square</span><span class="c2">. The </span><span class="c0">river of life</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;would be the abundant and rich gifts of Christ, which are continually poured out to the saints, as it were borne and flowing to them like a river. And of the </span><span class="c0">river</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says that on this side and on that side there was a tree of life bearing fruit each month. The Lord calls the tree of life, according to what is written by the Proverbs writer concerning wisdom; he says &ldquo;the tree of life is for all who hold fast to it.&rdquo; (Prov. 3:18) But Paul handed over to us &ldquo;Christ as God&#39;s power and God&#39;s wisdom.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:24) And he says that not only do the saints possess the riches of Christ&#39;s gifts, but they also have and share in him dwelling within them; which is the head of the highest blessedness. But the </span><span class="c0">tree of life</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;is continuous, Christ, and unceasingly brings to completion fruits and gifts to the saints, as if to overtake zeal with zeal and lest they ever be deprived of divine flow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And </span><span class="c2">he says </span><span class="c0">the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c0">Leaves of life</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;are the patriarchs attached to Christ and holding him, prophets, apostles, evangelists, martyrs and confessors, and those who in due times officiate at the gospel and pastors of the church, and every righteous soul; who even now heal souls, and to the saints will be an addition of good things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says </span><span class="c0">there will be no more curse</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">For although the anathemas now may flee vehemently, nevertheless we are comforted in them, with myriad excuses sprouting up in us in knowledge and indeed in ignorance; but then the saints will be free from every stain of the soul, just as they are from physical stain. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says that in the city will be the kingdom </span><span class="c0">of God</span><span class="c2">. For this is </span><span class="c0">the throne</span><span class="c2">. And he says the saints will serve him with </span><span class="c0">worship</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;not burdensome, but with spiritual pleasure and joy. And this will come from seeing </span><span class="c0">his face</span><span class="c2">; for he says </span><span class="c0">they shall see his face</span><span class="c2">; and they will see, insofar as is attainable by human nature, even </span><span class="c0">his</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">name upon their foreheads</span><span class="c7 c2">. The present passage plainly signifies the unceasing remembrance and communion of God. For as God is ever present and inscribed upon them, so he will always be with the saints. And it is clear, and from what Paul said: &ldquo;and we shall always be with the Lord.&rdquo; (1 Thess. 4:17) </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 1 Thessalonians 4:17</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c23 c8">&quot;we shall always be with the Lord.&quot;</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;Then he also states the crown of blessedness, to be with Christ always.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But he says </span><span class="c0">there is no night</span><span class="c2">, in order that the saints may not need </span><span class="c0">the sun or lamp-light for illumination</span><span class="c2">, the divine light making their illumination uninterrupted.

I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book</span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Outside are the dogs</span><span class="c2">, he says. It is customary in the divine writing to call </span><span class="c0">dogs</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;those who associate with others because of their shamelessness and uncleanness. For Moses also says in Deuteronomy, the law of the advocator</span><span class="c2 c11">2</span><span class="c2">: &ldquo;You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute or the wages of a dog into the house of the Lord your God for any vow of yours.&rdquo; (Deut. 23:18) And since such persons are like dogs in their shamelessness, one of the philosophers outside also testifies, saying likewise: &ldquo;Flee from every murder and the beds of a woman&rsquo;s adultery;&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c11">3</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;and oaths of the blessed and shameless couches of youths. Therefore the dogs are outside the holy city and the conduct with the righteous, these and those. For what fellowship have they with the righteous of God?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And everyone who loves and practices falsehood,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he says will be outside. </span><span class="c0">Falsehood</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is everything contrary to nature; for since virtue is according to nature, because the Maker originally implanted in our nature the seed of virtue, wickedness is contrary to nature. Just as in bodies health is according to nature and disease contrary to nature, and sight and hearing are according to nature while blindness and deafness are contrary to nature, so in souls virtue is according to nature and wickedness contrary to nature; for health is parallel to virtue, and disease to wickedness. And in this respect wickedness is </span><span class="c0">falsehood</span><span class="c2">, because it often pretends to be virtue; for boldness is fashioned to appear as courage, wickedness as prudence, sloth as temperance, and baseness as justice. For all these are vices assuming the guise of virtue, and so he casts out of the divine precincts those who practice the </span><span class="c0">falsehood </span><span class="c7 c2">of wickedness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, Jesus</span><span class="c2">, he says, have </span><span class="c0">sent my angel to testify to you about these things to the churches</span><span class="c2">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">He says that to bear witness is not to do so in secret or in a private whisper, but before the congregations everywhere, so that no one, pretending ignorance, might be wicked through willing misconduct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He says that </span><span class="c0">I am the root and the offspring of David</span><span class="c2">, although with regard to what appears it would be more accurate to say, I am the shoot sprung from the root of David. But now, on the contrary, he has called himself </span><span class="c0">the root of David</span><span class="c2">, and not only </span><span class="c0">root</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;but also </span><span class="c0">offspring</span><span class="c2">, as has been said above. </span><span class="c0">Root</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;indeed and cause of all things, among which is </span><span class="c0">David</span><span class="c2">, insofar as God is what he is understood to be; and </span><span class="c0">offspring</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;truly of </span><span class="c0">David</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and having sprung from him according to the flesh, insofar as man is what he is understood to be. As to his being himself, for it is not tedious for me to say the same things often, and it is safe for those who encounter them, as the divine apostle in some of his discourses says. (see Philip. 3:1) Therefore since &ldquo;Emmanuel&rdquo; exists in both deity and humanity fully possessing each of the natures according to their proper principle, unconfused, unchangeably, indivisibly, incomprehensibly, and after the ineffable union we are persuaded that there is one person and one hypostasis and one operation, even if the distinction of the natures be not ignored, from which we say the ineffable union has been accomplished, not the natural property according to quality</span><span class="c2 c11">4</span><span class="c2">, as in the discourses of our inspired father Cyril</span><span class="c2 c11">5</span><span class="c7 c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The star</span><span class="c2">, he says, </span><span class="c0">is the morning</span><span class="c2">; either he means the sun, since the sun is also called the sun of righteousness in Malachi, (Mal. 4:2) and moreover &ldquo;fire fell upon them&rdquo; that sang to the prophet, that is, upon the chief priests of the Jews and they &ldquo;did not see the sun,&rdquo; (Ps. 57:9) namely the sun of righteousness Christ, or he means the morning star. For this is also called to Peter</span><span class="c2 c11">6</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;in the Second Epistle, saying, &ldquo;until the day approaches and the morning star rises in your hearts.&rdquo; (2 Peter 1:19) </span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c24"><span class="c10">Oecumenius commentary on 2 Peter 1:19</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c18">Therefore, </span><span class="c23 c8">as day approaches</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;(I speak of the presence of things), you will have </span><span class="c23 c8">the Morning Star</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;rising in your hearts: that is, the knowledge of Christ, or his presence and coming foretold by the prophets, illuminating your hearts like true light.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he says </span><span class="c0">the Spirit</span><span class="c2">, that is, the prophetic spirit, </span><span class="c0">and the bride</span><span class="c2">, the universal and the church everywhere, say </span><span class="c0">Come</span><span class="c7 c2">.

Amen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Some, speaking boldly and ignorantly and stirring up tongues, say that this divine Revelation was not composed by John himself the glorious evangelist and theologian; so they listen to this tradition as if at the fringe. I think this not from ignorance nor from the Revelation, but from simplicity alone, if I may speak boldly, and from fondness for earthly things and their efforts, fearful of the abrupt and undeniable conclusions. For when the divine and holy fathers testify openly, who can resist these things or of reaching in any way such a mind as to say that these things are not so? Even the great Basil, in his writings Against Eunomius</span><span class="c2 c11">7</span><span class="c7 c2">, making a refutation of his impious blasphemies and delusions, concerning which the divine theologian recalled in his fourth discourse, in which the difficulties and their solutions are taken from the God&#8209;breathed Scriptures about the controversies concerning the Son through the New and Old Testaments, begins therefore: If the Son is God by nature, and the Father is God by nature, the Son is not another God and the Father another, but similar. And elsewhere: When Moses cried concerning the Son, &ldquo;He who is,&rdquo; sent me (Ex. 3:14); but of the evangelist John: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; (Jn. 1:1) and not once was it &ldquo;was,&rdquo; but a fourth time, and again elsewhere &ldquo;He who is&rdquo; from God (Jn. 8:47), and &ldquo;He who is in the arms of the Father,&rdquo; (Jn. 1:18) and in other places: &ldquo;He who is in heaven,&rdquo; (Jn. 3:13) and in the Revelation: &ldquo;He who is, and he who was, and he who is to come.&rdquo; (Rev. 1:8) And he did not send away, but afterward again took up the witness of Paul. If then this Revelation were composed by some other John, as the folly of many holds, Basil the great would also have written the discourses from the Revelation under the name of the one who wrote it; but first setting forth the matters of Moses, then those of the apostle and theologian, and as he did those of the apostle Paul, he needed no other to bear witness to these. And these things are from the undeniable statements of the great and holy Basil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But the great Gregory, surnamed the Theologian, defending himself before the presence of the one hundred and fifty bishops</span><span class="c2 c11">8</span><span class="c2">, whom they call the Collection, plainly indeed wrote: &ldquo;Until when will you inherit my holy mountain?&rdquo; and other things: &ldquo;for I am persuaded that others will rule other churches,&rdquo; as John teaches me through the Revelation</span><span class="c2 c11">9</span><span class="c2">. But Eusebius Pamphilus</span><span class="c2 c11">10</span><span class="c2">, in his third discourse of the Ecclesiastical History said therefore: as for those things concerning the Jews, they were among these, and other things: in this passage the apostle and evangelist John is held to be still living, and that for the sake of his testimony to the divine word he was condemned to dwell on the island of Patmos by Domitian son of Vespasian. Writing, indeed, Irenaeus concerning the vote called against the Antichrist in the so-called Revelation of John, in these exact words in the fifth book Against Heresies says these things about John: &ldquo;If it seems obvious in the present time that his name is being proclaimed, by him would be proclaimed even that of one who has seen the Revelation.&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c11">11</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c2">_____________________</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7 c22">Translator&rsquo;s notes for chapter 22.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1. &ldquo;And the Spirit and the bride say.&rdquo; The oldest Oecumenius manuscript omits &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; but it is in Oecumenius manuscripts 203 and 240, as well in the comments below by Oecumenius. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. &ldquo;advocator&rdquo; [&#7985;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&#8049;&nu;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;] Literally a teacher of religious rites and ceremonies, a high-priest, hierophant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3.
