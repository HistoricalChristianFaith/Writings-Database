class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">GENERAL INTRODUCTION</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The commentaries by Oecumenius on the Epistles to 1-2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were not written in the same manner as a common Bible commentary, written by one author, who interprets the Scripture passages, using his own thoughts and creativity throughout the body of work. But this commentary is a compilation of comments on each passage of Scripture that was gleaned from multiple Bible commentators and Early Church writers. This technique of taking excerpts from other writers and compiling them together to form a running commentary on Scripture was an exegetical style called Catena, which became a practice in Early Christianity for creating a study tool for clergy and students of the Scriptures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As for the authorship of this catena, or to speak more precisely, the &ldquo;compiler&rdquo; of this catena, for centuries has been credited to Oecumenius, the Greek bishop of Tricca. For a long time it was believed that Oecumenius wrote his Bible commentaries around 990AD, but when his lost commentary on the book of Revelation, which Franz Diekamp rediscovered in 1901, and H. C. Hoskier published in 1928, the date of the Revelation manuscript pointed towards an earlier date, around the 6</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;century, making him a contemporary of Andrew of Caesarea. Andrew also wrote a commentary on the book of Revelation in the 6</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;century and somewhat in opposition to the commentary on Revelation by Oecumenius. H.C. Hoskier, who published the first critical edition of the commentary on Revelation by Oecumenius, understood Oecumenius to be the same author of the commentary on Revelation and all of the other NT commentaries, saying&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c7">It is, therefore, not inappropriate to bring to public attention the text and commentary of OECUMENIUS, who flourished in the sixth and seventh centuries, and whose commentary on the Apocalypse has been missing for a long period, although some of his commentaries on other New Testament books have come down to us. Attributed generally to the tenth century, the document which we now publish itself gives us the correct date (preceding Andrew [of Caesarea] 563-614 A.D. and Arethas 860-939 A.D.), and we can now place Oecumenius, Greek Bishop of Tricca, towards the beginning of the seventh century.</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Naturally, this led some scholars to place the date of the other commentaries by Oecumenius to the 6</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;century. Many scholars today do not accept that the Oecumenius who wrote the commentary on Revelation to be the same author of the commentaries on Acts, Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, and the Catholic Epistles. For nearly a century now, there has been a renewed interest in Greek catenae, and effort has been taking place where scholars are in the works of producing critical texts of what they term the Pseudo-Oecumenian catena, which means that they believe that these commentaries have been falsely attributed to Oecumenius. I personally hold to the traditional view that the author of the commentary on Revelation to be the same author who wrote the other commentaries. But I do want to say that I am in no way dogmatic and I am completely open to the view held by modern scholars that the catena was perhaps falsely attributed to Oecumenius. I will explain my reasons below why I hold this position, and I will provide some excerpts from both points of view and then let you the reader come to their own conclusions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this catena on the Pastoral Epistles and the Epistle to Philemon there are excerpts from some of the Early Church Fathers that Oecumenius gleaned from. Not all excerpts have the names given from whom the sources are from. For those excerpts which have been named throughout the catena or partially quoted or referenced, Gregory of Nyssa (335-395A.D.), John Chrysostom (died around 407A.D.), Theodoret of Cyrus (393-457A.D.), Cyril of Alexandria (died around 444A.D.), Photius of Constantinople (810-891A.D.), and Oecumenius (6</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;century) himself have been specifically quoted and labelled as excerpts. There are undoubtedly more excerpts that are not identified, but I limited the amount of time that I spent to locate all the sources, though I truly wish that I had the time to identify as many of the excerpts as I could. Oecumenius relied heavily upon the homilies by John Chrysostom (died around 407A.D.) throughout the entire catena, but his name is only given two times as a source [once in 1 Tim. once in 2 Tim.]. Oecumenius took the interpretations from Chrysostom as the primary source but repackaged it, oftentimes in a more concise manner. Oecumenius did that same technique with some other sources as well, which makes it a bit challenging to locate the sources from where the original thoughts came from. The excerpts from Photius of Constantinople were a later stage of manuscript development and are found in three places throughout the catena (once in 1 Tim. once in 2 Tim. and once in Philemon), but those excerpts were added later by copyists, oftentimes as outer marginal notes, but then were later grafted into the main text by later editors. Photius was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 858 to 867 and from 877 to 886, which means that he came much later than Oecumenius of the 6</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;century.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">My Translation</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This translation of the Pastoral Epistles and the Epistle to Philemon was translated from volume 119 of the Patrologia Graeca printed edition of 1864. I have recently translated the commentaries on the Catholic Epistles by Oecumenius, and they are published and available in print and electronic versions</span><span class="c0 c12">2</span><span class="c0">. That translation of the commentaries on the Catholic Epistles was also translated directly from volume 119 of the Patrologia Graeca printed edition of 1864. The translation of the commentary on Hebrews by Oecumenius that I have recently published was a mix of Greek sources that I consulted, that being the Patrologia Graeca of 1864 and an earlier Greek version that was published in 1844 by Theoclitus Pharmakides</span><span class="c0 c12">3</span><span class="c2 c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I also used the Pauline commentaries from the Greek Church, Collected and edited from catena manuscripts, by Dr. Karl Staab</span><span class="c0 c12">4</span><span class="c2 c0">, published in 1933. This edition was very helpful for me to locate many excerpts from the text that were not identified who the sources were, nor given any indication of where the excerpts began or ended. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">Oecumenius vs Pseudo-Oecumenius</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As mentioned above, I am not dogmatic about whether the original compiler of the catena on Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, Acts, and the Catholic Epistles is the same author of the 6</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;century commentary on Revelation, but I do favor that it is the same Oecumenius who authored both. &nbsp;As an author of over twenty published books, I can relate to writing in two different styles, one as a complier, and also as an author based upon my own thoughts and creativity. I have also seen different styles of writings among many authors of the Early Church. I have not only seen different styles of writings from a single author, but I have also seen different manuscripts of the same writing from the same author have significant differences between them. That is one reason why textual critics are motivated to develop critical texts based upon the best manuscripts that are available in order to have a reliable standardized text. I have encountered this &ldquo;dilemma&rdquo; in my own translation projects in the past, especially with the English translation of the Glossa Ordinaria on the book of Revelation and the Questions on the Old and New Testaments by Ambrosiaster. As the editor of the translation of the Glossa Ordinaria on the book of Revelation, I chose to use a 12</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;century Gloss manuscript as well as a 13</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;century manuscript, and then a 15</span><span class="c0 c12">th</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;century version of the Gloss. Instead of trying to create a critical text, I decided to adopt glosses that I knew were not from the original glossator because they added value to the commentary as an exegetical tool for the readers. I had the same motivation when I translated the Questions on the Old and New Testaments by Ambrosiaster. There were two versions of the work by Ambrosiaster, one was a shorter version and another a longer version. I translated both for the same reason, and that is for the value of the commentary. And for this translation of the Catena on the Pastoral Epistles and Philemon by Oecumenius, there are excerpts that I know that are not original to the author but the content that has been carefully modified in over time. The Photius excerpts are an obvious addition by editors and copyists, but they add value to the commentary as a tool for exegetical purposes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">For those who reject the Oecumenian authorship, they provide legitimate arguments, but I am still not convinced even after examining all the arguments. The primary argument is that the name &ldquo;Oecumenius&rdquo; has been prefixed to some of the excerpts, as if an anonymous author or a later copyist added excerpts from an Oecumenius scholia. Since the catena has excerpts from Oecumenius, then the original author would not be Oecumenius. This is the argument that Karl Staab makes&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c7">One only needs to examine the commentaries of Paul of more recent and newest times and one will repeatedly find Oecumenius cited as a key witness of Greek Pauline exegesis. But research based on the earliest manuscript sources increasingly destroys his fame. In the introductory volume I believe I have provided the definitive proof that this great compilation of all the Pauline epistles does not belong to our Oecumenius, that it contains only a number of scholia from his hand.</span><span class="c0 c12">4</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">That does make logical sense, but I find the argument in the introductory material of the Patrologia Graeca to be quite satisfying to me, saying&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c7">Moreover, although in the earlier books no one has prefixed his name, as is the custom among the Greeks, never publishing under his own name what he has not elaborated by his own effort, but rather collecting certain patches from various sources: yet from evident conjectures we gather that Oecumenius is partly the author of these, partly the collector who, however, sometimes, when he presents his opinion after others, has also added his own name, lest anyone attribute it to others, which he himself did not consider worthy to be compared with their opinions.</span><span class="c0 c12">5</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I can totally relate to that myself. Years ago I was creating a catena, that I called </span><span class="c0 c1">The Aquinas Study Bible</span><span class="c0">, for my website</span><span class="c0 c12">6</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;where I would provide the Scripture text followed by excerpts from the Church Fathers as well as some of the Scholastic theologians, and there were some places where I would add my own comments and I would prefix my own name to the excerpt so that people knew what was coming from me, and not by Patristic writers who I considered far superior to myself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The commentaries by Oecumenius on Acts, Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, and the Catholic Epistles gained a lot of favor throughout the centuries and were consulted by many great theologians throughout the centuries, but his commentary on the book of Revelation, even though his was the very first Greek commentary on Revelation, did not have the same fame because the church of the East were very slow to accept Revelation as canonical, and it was overshadowed by the commentary on Revelation by Andrew of Caesarea, and it was considered lost until it was rediscovered in 1901. As for me, I place great value upon all of his commentaries because he does an excellent job providing clear and well balanced interpretations of the Scriptures, which has been my main motivation for taking on the work of translating his commentaries into English so that more people can read and benefit from his commentaries on Scripture the way I have over the years. Lord willing, I will continue this labor of love by translating as many of his Bible commentaries as I can.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">Acknowledgements</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">I want to give a special thank you to Darren Weeks, who has spent many hours proofreading my translation and giving me encouragement and sharing many links to very helpful content concerning this project, as well as other projects that I have done in the past. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">_______________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Translator notes for the introduction</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c2 c7">1.

Having learned this, the apostle urges Timothy to remain there to correct them, and he writes the letter. First of all, he reminds Timothy, knowing the faith in Christ, teaching him about the law, to prevent those who speak contrary to the correct doctrine and to rebuke them. For he himself also handed over Hymenaeus and Alexander</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">to Satan so that they might be disciplined and not blaspheme, who had shipwrecked concerning the faith, to Satan so that they might be disciplined and not blaspheme. Having reminded Timothy of these things, Paul then ordains apostolic rules for him. First, concerning prayer, how, where, and for whom one ought to pray. Second, concerning the silence of women in the church, and that they should rather learn, and not teach. Third, concerning bishops, elders, and deacons, how and what kind those appointed ought to be. Fourth, concerning the widows in the church, from what age they should be counted, what kind they ought to be, and how they ought to be cared for.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Fifth, concerning the moderation of the younger ones, and to marry rather, and not to live shamefully. Sixth, concerning commanding the rich not to be arrogant, nor to put their hope in wealth. Having arranged these matters, Paul is encouraged to teach them; and to not drink water</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span><span class="c2 c0">, but to pay attention to himself and to the teaching, knowing that there will be times when some will depart from the faith. Having taught that foods are clean, and having commanded him to avoid quarrelsome disputes, as they are profane, on account of which some, boasting, have broken the faith; and finally, the manner in which one must rule and order, he completes the letter.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">THEODORET</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although Paul had other disciples as well, such as Silas, Luke, and others, why does he write only to Timothy and Titus by name?</span><span class="c0 c12">2</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;And we might say that he had already entrusted these churches to their leadership but still kept the others with him. Paul writes to Timothy about what is proper for a teacher.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">______________________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Translator notes for introduction.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">1. &ldquo;to not drink water.&rdquo; This is concerning 1 Timothy 5:23 where Paul tells Timothy to not drink just water for his stomach, but to drink some wine for it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">2. The reason why Paul does not mention Philemon here is because technically the epistle to Philemon is not a Pastoral Epistle, but rather a letter to an individual.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">The First Epistle to Timothy by the Apostle Paul</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c9"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c16">CHAPTER 1</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 1:1-2</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the command of God our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope, To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Paul still shows modesty now at the beginning when he says, I did not come on my own initiative, but was commissioned by God. But where was he commissioned? In the Acts of the Apostles, where the Spirit says, &quot;Set apart for me Saul and Barnabas,&quot; (Acts 13:2) and there the Lord says to him, &quot;I am sending you far to the Gentiles.&quot; (Acts 22:21) But whatever the Son or the Spirit commanded, he says the Father commanded these things. For it is the will of the Holy Trinity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope</span><span class="c0">. The apostles say that we suffer much, but we have God as </span><span class="c0 c1">our Savior</span><span class="c2 c0">, and Christ as the Savior of our hope. For the term &quot;Savior&quot; is to be understood commonly. For He Himself provides, they say, the hope that we will be saved.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">a genuine child</span><span class="c2 c0">. Wow! The faith that Timothy demonstrated, that even through it he became a genuine child of Paul! For nothing changed according to the faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Grace, mercy</span><span class="c2 c0">. Here mercy is prayed for, not as usual, showing both the desire towards it, and that teachers need more mercy.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">On the guidance into the love of God, which is not required by legal necessity.</span></p><p class="c3 c10" id="h.f709pirktfp"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 1:3-4</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">As I urged you, stay in Ephesus when you go to Macedonia, so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, who provide questions rather than the household of God, which is by faith</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">See the words of the petitioner and teacher: </span><span class="c0 c1">stay in Ephesus</span><span class="c2 c0">. (For Paul&#39;s Epistle was rather not sufficient to correct these.) Here, however, he was appointed bishop by laying on of hands.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">So that you may command certain people</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul did not say, &quot;Please,&quot; but, as to the corrupt, he says, &quot;command with severity.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not to teach false doctrines</span><span class="c2 c0">. There were some false apostles from the Jews again leading people to the law, and teaching other counterfeit doctrines.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">nor to pay attention to myths</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul calls myths the fictional doctrines. For the one who speaks these things teaches a different doctrine. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and endless genealogies</span><span class="c0">. For they counted the forefathers and ancestors, like the Jews around the divine Abraham, adorning themselves with them, and doing nothing good themselves. But the term &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">endless</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; means those who have no useful end, either those who speak or those who listen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who provide inquiries.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If inquiries is in condemnation, how does Christ say, &quot;Seek and you will find,&quot; (Matt. 7:7) and, &quot;Do you seek the Scriptures?&quot; (Jn. 5:39) because seeking is of the means. For it is sometimes good to seek, as in, &quot;Seek first the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (Matt. 6:33)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">It is even evil to seek, as the philosophers do, the heavenly and the essence of God. Therefore, here you will seek, he says, the foolish things, the combative ones.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 1:5-7</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">The goal of the command is love from a pure heart and of a good conscience and sincere faith; from which some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to empty talk, desiring to be teachers of the law, not understanding either what they say or the matters about which they make confident claims</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">For since this was the case, the practice of teaching others also ceased. How so? Because from not loving, envy entered some against the teachers due to their desire to be teachers themselves. Therefore, the practice of teaching others ceased.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For he says, </span><span class="c0 c1">from a pure heart</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">For it is also possible to love from an impure heart, like the friendships of thieves toward thieves. </span><span class="c0 c1">From a pure heart</span><span class="c2 c0">, as well as perfect love, he says, you yourself command. Indeed, those things which are the chief parts of speeches, are repeated at the beginning and at the end by those who give commands, because these are easier to remember.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and of a good conscience</span><span class="c2 c0">. I do not seek, Paul said, that which is extended merely to words, which can also be in hypocrisy, but that which proceeds from the heart, and is pure in that way: which comes from conscience and from the thought that arises from it, which alone has no hypocrisy. For who would be the one to deceive himself, or try to conceal it? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">from which</span><span class="c2 c0">. Being, of the things spoken, of the household of God in faith, and of sincere love. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">having missed the mark</span><span class="c2 c0">. For it requires skill, so as not to fall outside the aim of the truth.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to empty talk</span><span class="c2 c0">. What he said above: To inquiries and genealogies, now he says, to empty talk.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">desiring to be teachers of the law</span><span class="c2 c0">. Another excuse for failure. For not only, he says, does hostility lead to this, but also ambition for honor, which itself arises from hatred and envy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not understanding either what they say</span><span class="c2 c0">. He wants to show that they truly came from love of power to wanting to be teachers. For neither do they know the law, nor about the things about which they make confident claims. For if they had known the law, they would have believed in Christ, which is also said elsewhere. &ldquo;Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not hear the law?&rdquo; (Gal. 4:21) For if they had known the law, they would certainly have believed that it leads to Christ.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 1:8-11</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">And we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the righteous but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for sexually immoral persons, for men who practice homosexuality, for enslavers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing contrary to sound doctrine, according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to me</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that the law is good</span><span class="c0">. If it&#39;s anything other than this [</span><span class="c0 c1">that is, using it lawfully</span><span class="c2 c0">], it&#39;s not good. But who is the one who lawfully uses it? The one who is sent to faith through it. For the law does not have the power to justify, but it leads to Christ who is able to justify. For the one who fulfills it, not the one who interprets it, lawfully uses it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">understanding this</span><span class="c2 c0">. And Paul says that the one who knows has used the law legitimately, knowing that he does not need it for living rightly. But who is this? The one who lives morally through virtue, and not through fear of the law.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for the lawless and disobedient</span><span class="c0">. This is also said elsewhere;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot;The law was added because of transgressions.&quot; (Gal. 3:19) So for the righteous and not transgressing, there will be no law, but for those who do not have virtue from themselves, but are in need of the threat of the law. And then he specifies them, hinting that the Jews possess these things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to the ungodly and sinners</span><span class="c2 c0">. For those who continuously worship idols, those who sacrifice their children to demons, those who stone Moses (Num. 14:10), and Jews who are defiled by civil murders, would they not be all these things?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and if there is any other thing contrary to sound doctrine</span><span class="c2 c0">. For all these are passions of a corrupted soul. But such a soul acts contrary to sound and good teaching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">according to the Gospel of glory</span><span class="c0">. But what is sound doctrine? It is that which is according to the Gospel of God. That Gospel is called the </span><span class="c0 c1">Gospel of glory</span><span class="c2 c0">, because through it Christ, who chose the cross, is most glorified.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Concerning Paul&rsquo;s own calling to be an evangelist, by grace of God, from being a persecutor.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 1:12-14</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">And I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to minister, though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man; but I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord overflowed exceedingly with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Since Paul said, &quot;which was committed to me,&quot; (1 Tim. 1:11) so that he might not seem to boast, he attributes everything to God, and he says, &quot;I have grace because He has given me this power,&quot; for the Gospel to be entirely believed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who has strengthened me</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For Paul says, I have been given a great burden, and I am in need of much strength from God.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">because He considered me faithful</span><span class="c0">. Then Paul shows that something has also been brought in from us. For God is not indiscriminately selective of some. For the matter would have been disapproved. And he says;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">because He considered me faithful</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; But how could God consider one who is not worthy of faith to be faithful? He is faithful, who does not take any of God&#39;s things to himself, but also commits his own things to God.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to minister</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, of the Gospel. He says &quot;minster&quot; because it means to preach. The proof that I considered myself trustworthy is that the ministry of the Gospel was entrusted to me. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">though I was formerly a blasphemer</span><span class="c2 c0">. See how Paul increases the mercy of God, remembering his former life, and showing whom he chose to have mercy on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">And a persecutor</span><span class="c2 c0">. For Paul would say: Not only was I uttering blasphemies, but also by persecuting others, I compelled them to speak blasphemies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but I was shown mercy</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul shows himself worthy of punishment, for mercy is shown in these cases.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">because I acted ignorantly</span><span class="c0">. If Paul did it ignorantly, he was shown mercy; why then were not the Jews also shown mercy? And we say, first of all, that they do not want it. For those who approached Christ were shown mercy. But why did not all see the vision as Paul did? For if so, all would have approached. Because Paul persecuted out of ignorance, but those others did so knowingly.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Heard the evangelist saying that many of the Pharisees and Jews believed, but they did not confess it; &ldquo;For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.&rdquo; (Jn. 12:43) And again Jesus said to them;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;How can you believe, who receive glory from one another?&quot; (Jn. 5:44) And again: &quot;This they said, his parents said, because of the Jews, so that they themselves would not be put out of the synagogue.&quot; (Jn. 9:22) And the Jews themselves were saying, &quot;Do you see that we are not benefiting at all? Behold, the whole world is going after him.&quot; (Jn. 12:19)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Did you see them sinning in knowledge, for the sake of ambition? At that time Paul was perhaps at the feet of Gamaliel, not associating with the crowd, and after that, seeing the faith of Christ increasing, he was zealous with the zeal of God, though not in full knowledge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in unbelief</span><span class="c2 c0">. From the law, Paul read about Christ. Therefore, since he did not immediately believe in Christ, he calls the matter concern, born from unbelief.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the grace of our Lord overflowed exceedingly</span><span class="c2 c0">. For not only, he says, did He leave unpunished one deserving of punishment, but He also justified him, and made him a son, and a friend, and an heir.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">with faith and love</span><span class="c2 c0">. Moreover, it abounded with my faith and love, and both came to me through Christ himself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For he says &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; And Paul spoke of faith and love, that it is one thing to believe, but not to do the things of those who love Christ. However, he showed that it is necessary for us to bear something as well.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 1:15-17</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But for that very reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his unlimited patience as an example to those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">The saying is trustworthy</span><span class="c0">, that is, the spoken word is true. &quot;You will know from me,&quot; Paul says. &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">of whom I am the foremost</span><span class="c0">.&quot; And yet elsewhere he says, &quot;According to the righteousness which is in the law made blameless.&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">(Philip. 3:6)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How then does Paul call himself sinful and the </span><span class="c0 c1">foremost of sinners</span><span class="c0">? And we say that righteousness from the law, when compared with that from faith, is not only not righteousness, but also the first sin.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&quot; (Rom. 3:23)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">In this comparison, it has also been used elsewhere, where it says: &quot;For even that which has been glorified has not been glorified in this part, because of the surpassing glory.&quot; (2 Cor. 3:10)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But for that very reason I was shown mercy</span><span class="c2 c0">. See what humble thing Paul said. He says, &quot;Since I, the most sinful of all, have been saved, there is no longer need to doubt about salvation.&quot; For he wants to show that he was not saved as one worthy of salvation, but in order not to cause others to despair of their salvation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">unlimited patience</span><span class="c2 c0">. Oh, the humility of Paul! For every kind of evil, he says, I was in need of unlimited patience, not a part of it, as those who have sinned only in part.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">as an example</span><span class="c2 c0">. For encouragement, for demonstration.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to receive eternal life</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the faith that is in Christ is for eternal life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">To the King of the ages</span><span class="c2 c0">. These things concerning the holy accepted Trinity. For such titles are common to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For these are found elsewhere concerning the Son, elsewhere concerning the Spirit, but now concerning the Father.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to the only wise God</span><span class="c2 c0">. Having reasoned about Christ&#39;s love, Paul also remembers the Father and sends up praise to himself, so that no one might think the Father is a sharer in the love toward us. For on account of the love toward us, the holy Trinity must be glorified, since the love is common.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Instruction concerning faithful and honorable service, which is without risk.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 1:18-20</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I entrust this command to you, Timothy, my child, according to the prophecies previously made about you, so that by them you may wage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, have suffered shipwreck concerning the faith; among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan that they may be taught not to blaspheme</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">this command</span><span class="c2 c0">. It means careful observation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I entrust</span><span class="c2 c0">. As to a child, Paul says, I command, not according to any authority applying to masters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">according to the prophecies previously</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the sake of emphasis it is placed there. However, the order is this: As soldiers next to those prophecies which have gone before concerning you, that is, as suitable soldiers, responding to the prophecies which were about you. For according to the revelation of the Spirit, Timothy was chosen by Paul as a disciple, and was circumcised, and was ordained a bishop.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">them you may wage the good warfare</span><span class="c2 c0">. As a soldier of Christ fighting with spiritual weapons in every way against spiritual enemies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">by them</span><span class="c2 c0">. Namely, by the prophecies: for they have chosen you. Therefore, because of which you were received and by whom you were chosen, serve in them and through them, that is, through the Spirit Himself through whom the prophecies exist.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the good warfare</span><span class="c2 c0">. For there is also a bad warfare, concerning which it is said: &quot;Just as you have presented your members as weapons for sin and impurity.&quot; (Rom. 6:13) </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">holding faith</span><span class="c0">. For one must be a teacher of oneself before being a teacher to others. And </span><span class="c0 c1">faith</span><span class="c0">, he says, is about doctrines, while </span><span class="c0 c1">conscience</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;is about conduct.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which some having rejected</span><span class="c2 c0">. Of these, Paul says, conscience is about living rightly. For when someone lives without consideration it also shipwrecks their faith. In order not to be tormented by the fear of what is to come, they strive to persuade their own soul that all things concerning us, both about resurrection and judgment, are false.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">whom I have handed over to Satan that they may be taught.</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Since Satan does not instruct himself, how can he bring good teaching to others? And we say, just as executioners, full of countless evils, train others to be prudent, so also does Satan. For when a person is handed over to Satan, it is by the exclusion from communion. Then the demon, having taken the person stripped of God&#39;s help, disciplines him. And this is done for his correction. But why do they hand over to Satan, and he himself does not discipline? So that it may be shown that even Satan is able to coerce, and so that, along with punishment, they are also insulted, with Satan being the avenger. For the apostles punished the unbelievers for their own sake, as Paul himself did to Bar-Jesus and Elymas (Acts 13), and Peter to Ananias (Acts 5); to show that they were able. But those who learned from these things, yet turned away, they handed over to Satan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not to blaspheme</span><span class="c2 c0">. For these, by subjecting faith to human reasoning, have gone astray and blaspheme, as now the Nestorians suffer, and the other heresies.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c16">CHAPTER 2</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">On prayer, that it is above all, that it is everywhere, without wickedness, without disturbance, reverently.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 2:1-4</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people; for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In daily worship, this would be before the remembrance of others, he says. </span><span class="c0 c1">To make petitions</span><span class="c0">. A </span><span class="c0 c1">petition</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a plea offered for deliverance from troubles. </span><span class="c0 c1">Prayer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a request for good things. </span><span class="c0 c1">Intercession</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;is an accusation against wrongdoers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">thanksgivings</span><span class="c2 c0">, for it is necessary to give thanks for the good things that happen to one another.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">be made for all people</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since the bishop is a common father, he ought to pray for all people, both the faithful and the unbelievers, friends and enemies, those who slander and those who afflict.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for kings</span><span class="c0">. Then, so that the matter might not appear to be flattery, first saying, </span><span class="c0 c1">be made for all people</span><span class="c0">; thus he declared, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c1">for kings and all who are in high positions</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life</span><span class="c2 c0">. Let no Christian be disturbed in any way; therefore, during the time of the mysteries, let him remember that the king, since he is often unfaithful, shows that our profit is their salvation. But how is their salvation our profit? How? For if they are preserved and conduct themselves excellently in wars against enemies, we live quietly and peacefully with no one disturbing us. It would indeed be absurd if they were to be exhausted for the common safety, but we do not even bring together that which is in us as help (I mean prayer) for them. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in all godliness</span><span class="c2 c0">. There are three kinds of wars: one is against the Barbarians; one is against those of the same race; the third, which the soul wages against the body, which is the hardest of all. For the war against the Barbarians brings only death or slavery. The war against those of the same race, I have learned to avoid through gentleness. &quot;Instead of loving me,&quot; he says, &quot;they attacked me, but I prayed.&quot; (Ps. 109:4) And, &quot;I was peaceful among those who hate peace&quot;. (Ps. 120:6) But the one within ourselves is difficult to accomplish, and it brings harm to the soul. Therefore, he wishes to pray for the kings, so that they may both conquer and endure, knowing that the peace from the Barbarians greatly contributes to the peace within ourselves. For if one must be at leisure and know God, then freedom and harmony are necessary for the knowledge of God and kindness. How then could those engaged in wars with the Barbarians be at rest? For it is noble and undeniable to pray for all people, both Greeks and others, so that they may turn back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who desires all people to be saved</span><span class="c2 c0">. He says, if He Himself desires all to be saved, the Lord who also saves, who then needs my prayers? Yes. For you draw them and those to love, and you show affection. &quot;Imitate,&quot; He says, &quot;the purpose of God.&quot; (Eph. 5:1) For He Himself desires all people to be saved, and you pray for all people above all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and to come to the knowledge of the truth</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul said, &quot;To the knowledge of the truth.&quot; Then he explains what the truth in doctrines is. If therefore God wills, he says, why does what He wills not happen? It does not happen because they do not want it. For God does nothing by compulsion.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 2:5-7</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time; for this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For there is one God, and one mediator</span><span class="c0">. Note that he did not say, Two, but, One and one, thus avoiding the multiplication of gods. Since the one who was to mediate was absent, to partake of both so that He could also mediate, the Son of God, the eternal</span><span class="c0 c12">2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Logos [&#8001; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&alpha;&iota;&#974;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; &Lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;], having become incarnate, came forth, existing from two natures, namely from divinity and humanity, and is understood and worshiped in one person after the union.</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;For if the Only Begotten had appeared to us in bare divinity, creation would not have shown Him, where the sons of Israel were not able to see the face of Moses. But the phrase &quot;One God&quot; is not placed in opposition to the Son or the Spirit&mdash;far from it!&mdash;but against those who are not, called gods. It is asked why the Spirit is not mentioned. Because the discussion was about the Greeks. For concerning them is the phrase, &quot;and to come to the knowledge of the truth.&quot; (1 Tim. 2:4) Among them there was polytheism, and he carefully guarded the economy of remembering the &quot;Spirit,&quot; lest somehow he introduce the appearance of polytheism. Since he converses there with the faithful, he continually remembers Him, often even alone, not bringing to mind the Father and the Son.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the man Christ Jesus</span><span class="c0">. As He was man, so He was also God, indivisibly, inseparably.</span><span class="c0 c12">3</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who gave himself as a ransom for all</span><span class="c2 c0">, and of the Greeks. Therefore, he died for all, but you do not endure to pray? Note then the phrase, &quot;who gave himself.&quot; For this is against the Arians, who say that he was delivered up unwillingly. But what is the price of redemption? Nature was unwilling to perish, but Jesus gave Himself for it.</span></p><p class="c3" id="h.wyxjojnktazo"><span class="c0 c1">the testimony</span><span class="c0">. That is, through the testimony the Son became a ransom. The interpreter now says this means that the testimony is called a ransom, that is, the passion. For He came to bear witness to the truth. He testified by what He did, that He Himself is Christ, the Son of God, even to death. For He also revealed the Father, and introduced the true doctrine and the true and angelic life, </span><span class="c0 c1">given at the proper time</span><span class="c2 c0">, He says. That is, when people were suitably disposed toward faith. Thus Clement of Alexandria in the seventh &ldquo;Hypotyposes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">at the proper time</span><span class="c0">. Through the testimony, he gave himself, he says, </span><span class="c0 c1">as a ransom</span><span class="c0">. Through the testimony, that is, through the passion (for in it he bears witness to the goodness of the Father that he gave both himself and the Son. But they did not cease their hostility toward him, but even crucified the Son. And that he wishes to fulfill the promises to them, but they do not want it), </span><span class="c0 c1">in proper time</span><span class="c2 c0">, he says, having been prefigured and predestined by the holy and blessed Trinity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for this I was appointed</span><span class="c0">. To which I was appointed as a testimony and a passion, and I was set apart as a preacher, so that I might make the cross revealed everywhere. And since he was about to say, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">teacher of the Gentiles</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; it seemed unbelievable if the idolaters were called, he proclaimed beforehand: &quot;I speak the truth, I do not lie.&quot; (Rom. 9:1)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">teacher of the Gentiles</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since there is also the practice of proclaiming hastily, he called himself Teacher. For I did not only proclaim, but also, remaining, I taught. This, however, shows God&#39;s zeal concerning the Gentiles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in faith and truth</span><span class="c0">. Since he said, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">in faith</span><span class="c0">,&quot; so that no one might think that it is deceit, he adds, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">in truth</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; I do not preach with persuasive words or with linguistic twists, but in faith. For this shows the power of the preaching.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 2:8-10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Therefore I want the men to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves in respectable clothing, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly clothing, but, as be appropriate women who profess godliness, with good works</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How then did Christ forbid praying openly? &quot;For He says, &#39;Go into your room.&#39;&quot; (Matt. 6:6) Christ did not forbid praying in every place, but He said this to turn away from praying for show; just as in &quot;Let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing,&quot; (Matt. 6:3) He does not speak about hands, but about doing good deeds without empty glory and not for display. It is not the place that makes the difference, but everywhere He cared that we do not show off. Furthermore, the Apostle also makes this clear: Just as it was not permitted for the Jews to offer sacrifices outside the temple, so it is also with us to pray. For He says that every place is suitable for us, only if we </span><span class="c0 c1">lift up holy hands</span><span class="c2 c0">, that is, hands cleansed from impure grasping, greed, and murder, purified through almsgiving.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">without anger</span><span class="c2 c0">. Without bitterness, without cursing anyone. For true anger is not even wishing harm to befall one&#39;s brother.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">or disputing</span><span class="c2 c0">. So will God hear me? Or do I pray simply and in vain? For one must be convinced that God will listen, if we ask Him for things dear to Him while being pure.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Likewise, I want the women</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, I wish for them to raise their hands in holiness without anger or argument. Women require more than anything else to be adorned modestly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But the phrase, </span><span class="c0 c1">respectable clothing</span><span class="c2 c0">, clearly means to be covered on all sides; he says it properly, not excessively, so as to please those who see it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">with modesty and self-control</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, do not imitate those who are loved with a lustful desire, who look shamelessly and in the manner of &nbsp;high-class prostitutes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not with braided hair</span><span class="c0">. For you have not come to a theater, Paul says. You have come to weep for your sins. Luxury is not the attire of one in prayer, nor is your worldly arrogance fitting for one mourning their sins. But if these things, which only display wealth, are prohibited: much more so the curious and perverse things</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">such as the staining of the cheeks, painted eyes, renown walk, a broken voice, a wondering and curious eye, the raising of a prostitute&rsquo;s garment, a more elaborate belt, ripped shoes. For all these things, in other words, say, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">in respectable clothing</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; he cast out. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">That teachers ought to be men, and not women, because of nature and the affection that arises from error.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 2:11-15</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression. Yet she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control. This is a trustworthy saying</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Not only does he require women to be modest, but also silent and submissive; for through silence, they signify submission. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I do not permit a woman to teach</span><span class="c2 c0">. He removed every opportunity for a woman to speak. For since he commanded them to be silent, so that they would not speak under the grounds of a reasonable excuse for teaching, he says, &quot;Nor let them teach,&quot; not only human things but also spiritual ones. And he forbade teaching in the assembly. For he did not entirely remove teaching from them; for he allows them to teach their own children for a time, as he says later on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">or to exercise authority over a man</span><span class="c2 c0">. For to teach is indeed to assume authority over a man.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For Adam was formed first</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since Adam was formed first, the woman should not have authority over the man, but should be in submission to him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Adam was not deceived</span><span class="c2 c0">. As to the comparison with the deceit with which the woman was deceived, the behavior of Adam is neither deceit nor trickery. For it is much more reasonable to be deceived by the serpent than to accept the fruit from the woman and eat it. Therefore, in his defense, Paul says that he was not deceived, but that &quot;The woman whom you gave to be my helper, she gave to me and I ate.&quot; (Gen. 3:12) Calmly showing that Adam did not even err after listening to his helper. &quot;He was not deceived.&quot; Note that what precedes is to be understood as implied.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In another way also. How was Adam not deceived? Because neither does Scripture say this, but the woman indeed: &quot;The serpent deceived me.&quot; (Gen. 3:13) But Adam does not say; &quot;The woman deceived me,&quot; but, &quot;She gave me.&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">She gave to me: For it is not the same to be persuaded by a fellow and companion, and to be persuaded by a beast, slave, and one who is subordinated. Therefore, that was the deception. But neither did Adam see the tree that it was beautiful to eat, but the woman.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but the woman being deceived</span><span class="c2 c0">. And Paul brings this forward to prevent a woman from teaching. For once a woman has taught, Paul says, she overturns everything and makes the man subject to disobedience: for she was the author herself and advised him to eat. Therefore, he does not say: Eve was deceived; but the woman was deceived, indicating a nature that is easily deceived.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but the woman being deceived fell into transgression</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not only Eve became accountable to transgression, but also the whole sisterhood of women. For as in Adam we all die, so in Eve all have sinned.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Yet she will be saved through childbearing</span><span class="c0">. Not only Eve, but every woman. And by &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c1">childbearing</span><span class="c2 c0">,&rdquo; it is meant not only to bear children, but also to lead them according to God. What then shall one say, that virgins and barren women, and those without children and widows, are lost? Away with that though! For it does not say that they will not be saved by their own virtue; but that childbearing will also be a means of salvation for them, that is, the acknowledged means of being saved by their own virtue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">if they continue in faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. If Christians have nurtured and remained virtuous. What then if she herself is evil, but nurtures well? It certainly cannot happen that what is bad trains well; yet if it does happen, there will be a reward. But what if being good she nurtures evil? She will die because of the evil of the children. And the priest Eli is witness. (1 Sam. 2-4) </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">This is a trustworthy saying</span><span class="c2 c0">. Because the fathers, Paul says, will be able to share in the virtue of the children.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">_____________________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c31">Translator notes for 1 Timothy chapter 2.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">1. &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c1">Since the one who was to mediate was absent, to partake of both so that He could also mediate, the Son of God, the eternal Logos, having become incarnate, came forth, existing from two natures, namely from divinity and humanity, and is understood and worshiped in one person after the union</span><span class="c2 c7">.&rdquo; The preceding text is a theological statement consistent with the doctrines of the early Christian Church, particularly as defined by the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">2. &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&alpha;&iota;&#974;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; literally means &ldquo;before the ages&rdquo; or &quot;before the creation of the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">3. indivisibly, inseparably [&#7936;&delta;&iota;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&#941;&tau;&omega;&sigmaf;, &#7936;&sigma;&upsilon;&gamma;&chi;&#973;&tau;&omega;&sigmaf;] The Chalcedonian Definition, in 451AD at the Council of Chalcedon, was largely based on the 433 Formula of Reunion, with some additions from Cyril&#39;s letters.

For example, it used the phrase &quot;unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably&quot; (Greek: </span><span class="c17">&#7936;&sigma;&upsilon;&gamma;&chi;&#973;&tau;&omega;&sigmaf;</span><span class="c2 c7">, &#7936;&tau;&rho;&#941;&pi;&tau;&omega;&sigmaf;, &#7936;&delta;&iota;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&#941;&tau;&omega;&sigmaf;, &#7936;&chi;&omega;&rho;&#943;&sigma;&tau;&omega;&sigmaf;); the first two words were directed at Eutyches, and the second two at Nestorius.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c16">CHAPTER 3</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">On the Virtue of Bishops.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 3:1-4</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">If anyone aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task. Therefore, a bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach; not a drunkard, not violent, not greedy for gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money; one who manages his own household well, with children in submission with all reverence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Writing to Timothy, Paul shows in general what kind of person a bishop must be. &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">he desires a noble task</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; He says, &quot;I do not accuse him.&quot; An honest man is needed, certainly for service and leadership; provided that he desires it for helping many, and not for glory. For a bishop is said to be one who oversees all. Even Moses desired it, but not for glory, rather for the benefit of many.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">be blameless</span><span class="c2 c0">. So that he is aware of no evil in himself. For if he is aware, he acts badly desiring oversight, from which through his actions he has alienated himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">A bishop must be the husband of one wife</span><span class="c2 c0">. This does not legislate that a bishop must necessarily have a wife, but rather, if he is married, he says, he must not be a second husband. Or that he should know only one lawful wife for marriage; but, when called to the office of bishop, he must fulfill that condition. &quot;So that those who have wives may be as though they had none.&quot; (1 Cor. 7:29) And, &quot;I wish that all were as I am,&quot; says Paul. (1 Cor. 7:7) And, &quot;He who is married cares about worldly things.&quot; (1 Cor. 7:33) How then can a bishop rightly care for worldly matters? Some say that he said this concerning the Church, so that he would not transfer from one to another; for the matter is adultery.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Sober-minded</span><span class="c2 c0">. Awake, discerning, fervent in spirit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">self-controlled</span><span class="c0">. For one ought to have restraint, good manners, and hospitality according to those who lead. Therefore, Paul added the teacher&#39;s own characteristic, saying </span><span class="c0 c1">self-controlled</span><span class="c2 c0">: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not a drunkard</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says this, not meaning the intoxicated (for that was often the case), but the brazen and arrogant. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Again, </span><span class="c0 c1">not violent</span><span class="c2 c0">, not one who strikes with hands, but one who strikes the conscience of the brothers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">one who manages his own household well</span><span class="c2 c0">. For he who does not know how to rule a single household, or who could not properly govern two or three children by nature, how will he be able to suitably preside over the Church and so great a people? For he must bear examples from his own household.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 3:5-7</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God? He must not be a recent convert, lest, being arrogant, he fall into the judgment of the Devil. Moreover, he must have a good testimony from those outside, so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Whatever the bishops commanded in these strict matters, not drunkenness, not being violent, but moderation and the like, he who commanded the disciples, &quot;Put to death the members of your body on the earth;&quot; (Col. 3:5) and, &quot;Are some who crucified the flesh of Christ?&quot; (Gal. 5:24) And Christ commanded to take up the cross and follow Him for all. (Matt. 16:24) For why did he not rather command those to be angels, as if according to the measure of mortals? And we say that the highest virtue is of few: but it was necessary to have many bishops, one for each church. Therefore, lest he make the office of bishops, which was necessary, rare or impossible, Paul commands moderate virtue, making the matter itself easy to approach:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">how will he care for the church of God</span><span class="c2 c0">. Where there are greater and more numerous affairs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">He must not be a recent convert</span><span class="c0">. It does not mean the younger person, but one recently instructed in the faith.</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;For Timothy himself was also younger. &ldquo;For no one should despise your youth,&quot; (1 Timothy 4:12) he says as he goes on. For he who is still a student ought, if anyone makes him a teacher, to be proud and confident.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">he fall into the judgment of the Devil</span><span class="c2 c0">. To the same, Paul says, to the Devil, a judgment, into which he fell out of madness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">from those outside</span><span class="c2 c0">. Outside, says the Greeks. Observe the precision. What then if he is bad, but has a good testimony? This is impossible. For it is beloved for the most upright to be testified to by enemies. But this, along with other things, requires good qualities; for he also shows a bond. But what if, being good, he is despised concerning his life? Difficult indeed, but such a one must not become a bishop. And if from those outside, much more from the brothers. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that he may not fall into reproach</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">It is fitting for one who is bad to be reproached and insulted.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and the snare of the Devil</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if he is, he says, evil in some way, he easily sets another trap for him. For if he turns from being insulted and abused to sins, he falls into another passion of anger and resentment; for no one can endure insult without anger.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 3:8-10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Deacons likewise must be honorable, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain, holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.

That is, deceitful and traitorous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not given to much wine</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul did not say: &quot;Do not get drunk&quot; (for this was very common), but rather, &quot;Do not drink excessively.&quot; For even if, he says, they do not get drunk, yet the tone of the heart slackens. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">with a pure conscience</span><span class="c2 c0">. He demands faith and life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">And let these also first be tested</span><span class="c2 c0">. Just as, Paul says, the bishops, so that they may not be beginners.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 3:11-13</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Women likewise must be honorable, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. For those who serve well gain for themselves a good standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. These things I write to you, hoping to come to you soon; but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Women, not just any women, but deaconesses. For what did Paul wish to mention among the clergy, women of any kind? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not slanderous</span><span class="c2 c0">. &nbsp;What was said above: not to be double-tongued.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but sober-minded</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the female sex is not to be trusted. Therefore, one must be sober and watchful. For as much as they are more susceptible to deceits, so much so do they need sobriety.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">faithful in all things</span><span class="c2 c0">. In faith and life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">husbands of one wife</span><span class="c2 c0">. You see how the same things are required from deacons as from bishops? These things must also be accepted concerning deaconesses.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">managing their children and their own households well</span><span class="c2 c0">. He places this everywhere, wishing to bring the reproof upon them from home.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For those who serve well</span><span class="c2 c0">. Those who have entrusted themselves to the lesser things will quickly come to progress and boldness in Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and great confidence</span><span class="c2 c0">. But who would have confidence in the faith of Christ, except the one who lives with faith and a righteous life?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">These things I write to you</span><span class="c0">. In order that the arrangement concerning these matters may not throw Timothy into gloom because Paul is no longer present, see what Paul says: &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">But if I am delayed</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; Since he was led by the Spirit, and did not know where the Spirit was ordering him to go, therefore he always hesitates.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which is the Church of the living God</span><span class="c0">. Whoever is a house, is the Church of the living God; not like the Jewish temple, but a </span><span class="c0 c1">pillar and foundation</span><span class="c0">, that is, a confirmation of the truth. For the temple, he says, was a foundation of the types of truth. And rightly so, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">of the living God</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For do you not notice, he said, that it is filled with men: for it excels through God, and is built by Him, and has Him as its inhabitant.</span></p><p class="c3 c10 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 3:16</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, received up in glory</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">confessedly</span><span class="c2 c0">. For no one doubts this. And faith which is in us is both great and a mystery, and a mystery of devotion, and it has no hesitation. Do you see the steps?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">God was revealed in the flesh</span><span class="c2 c0">, etc. Then Paul speaks of the mystery. For He who was revealed to men in the flesh was not judged righteous by human eyes, but by the eyes of the Spirit, who also searches the depths of God. (1 Cor. 2:10)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But he says: </span><span class="c0 c1">He was justified because of the flesh</span><span class="c0">. For since God is God, he is not justified but justifies. This is also what the prophet said: &quot;He who has not committed sin, nor deceit found in his mouth.&quot; (1 Peter 2:22) Saint Cyril in the twelfth chapter of the Scholia</span><span class="c0 c12">2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;says: &quot;&rsquo;He </span><span class="c0 c1">who was revealed in the flesh was justified in the Spirit</span><span class="c2 c0">.&rsquo; For in no way was he subjected to our weaknesses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">seen by angels</span><span class="c2 c0">. For they did not disregard His birth according to the flesh. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] </span><span class="c0 c1">He was justified in spirit</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">And by what justification is he justified who is righteousness itself and redemption, the Sun of righteousness according to Malachi? Which indicates the most pure and perfect righteousness, the fulfillment evidently of the legal rights; concerning which John said: &quot;Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&quot; (Matt. 3:15) For since the law also commanded concerning baptisms, He came to the Jordan to fulfill this as well, just as He fulfilled circumcision and the offerings for the firstborn. But what does He mean by &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">In spirit</span><span class="c0">&quot;? Israel was bound in the spirit of slavery through the punishing law. For it did not have the spirit of adoption; this has been granted to Christians, as Paul also says: &quot;What is above is Jerusalem the free, which is the mother of us all.&quot; (Gal. 4:26)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He says therefore, Even if he fulfilled the legal righteous requirements, but not with the spirit of slavery (for how, he who also frees others?), but with the Holy Spirit of adoption, which the genuine Son received according to the human nature, bestowing the gift upon us, and consubstantial with the Spirit, and not for Himself. Just as He cared for and prayed, making our prayers acceptable, and called His own body a temple, causing us to become temples of God. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">For indeed, the righteous according to the Gospel, truly spiritual, have long surpassed many of those who are justified by the law.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [PHOTIUS] Instead of being justified legally, he was justified spiritually. For he fulfilled the legal commandments not legally, but spiritually. The fact that he was not considered justified by the fleshly and hard-hearted (for they said, &quot;Glutton and drunkard&quot;) but was justified by those who are established in the Spirit of God. &quot;For we have seen his glory, glory as of the only begotten,&quot; and so on.

For everywhere in the inhabited world he was believed. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">received up in glory</span><span class="c0">. For the angels ministered to him as he was taken up on the clouds.

For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But the Spirit openly says</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, clearly and obviously. Do not be amazed, Paul says, if some now, having fallen away from the faith, Judaize. For a time will come, he says, when the faith will be more broadly extended, in which they will do even worse things, not only in the observance of foods, but also in marriages and other matters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">paying attention to deceitful spirits</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if anyone departs from faith, everything else becomes dangerous. For it is necessary from then on that the mind be attentive to impure spirits, and to demons leading man away from the right path.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and teachings of demons</span><span class="c0">. Through these he revealed every wickedness, especially the Manichaeans, the Encratites, the Marcionites</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">through the hypocrisy</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, deceitful work. However, it stands that since they know the falseness of their dogmas, they strive to speak falsely. And Paul says that liars are those whose conscience has been seared by an evil life, that is, a depraved life: and because they are aware of much filth within themselves, therefore their conscience bears stubborn marks of a sleazy life. Truly, those who are such, through fear of retribution, pervert true dogmas, persuading themselves of anything rather than that only God is the just judge, the resurrection, and the retribution of good and evil.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who forbid marriage</span><span class="c2 c0">. What then? Do Christians not hinder from marrying? By no means. &ldquo;Marriage is honorable in all things, and the bed undefiled.&rdquo; (Heb. 13:4) But those who do not wish to marry are urged to abstinence. And those who hinder marriage are said to hinder on account of impurity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">abstain from foods</span><span class="c0">. It is not a mistake or a lapse in elegance of speech when it says,</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">to abstain from foods&rdquo;, which seemed to some not even a matter of apostolic vision, but rightly expressed according to the Attic custom (dialect). Just as the phrase, &quot;He prevented him from doing improper things,&quot; does not mean that he encouraged him to do improper things; and likewise, &quot;He deterred him from offending friends,&quot; does not mean offending friends, but rather the opposite. And again, &quot;He prevented him from stealing,&quot; does not mean that he permitted theft. And, &quot;He prevented ceasing from speaking,&quot; instead of, &quot;He kept away from such an action.&quot; Thus also, &quot;They prevented abstaining from foods,&quot; instead of, &quot;They prevented from eating.&quot; And this usage is also frequent among outsiders.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">created to be received </span><span class="c0">[&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#940;&lambda;&eta;&psi;&iota;&nu;]</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;with thanksgiving</span><span class="c0">. See how Paul expelled luxury in the name of participation [&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&#942;&psi;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;]. For </span><span class="c0 c1">to be received</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;[&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#940;&lambda;&eta;&psi;&iota;&nu;] signifies a measured reception [&mu;&epsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&eta;&mu;&#941;&nu;&eta;&nu;]. And he did not expel luxury as something unclean, but as something obstructive due to excess and, as it were, a rupture of the soul. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">To the faithful</span><span class="c0">, God has created foods </span><span class="c0 c1">to be received</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;[&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#940;&lambda;&eta;&psi;&iota;&nu;] thankfully. But not to the unbelievers anymore. For by their own laws they shut themselves off from them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who know the truth</span><span class="c2 c0">. The Jewish rites were indeed a shadow; now the truth has come. Many things were forbidden to them, not because they were impure, but to restrain indulgences. But the truth speaks of the faith which is in Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that every creature of God is good</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul speaks concerning things that are edible. He already anticipates the heresy of those introducing uncreated matter and said that those were foods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and nothing is to be rejected</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, neither should the idol&#39;s food be rejected, provided it is taken with prayer, if you are unaware: since by law you become guilty who are commanded not to be defiled by the food of idols; therefore, by transgressing the law, one is defiled: just as even what is entirely pure, and taken without thanksgiving, becomes defiled because of your voluntary ingratitude. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer</span><span class="c0">. If it is sanctified, then is it unclean? Far from it! For everything is clean; but here two points are made against those who say that some foods are unclean. First, that every creature of God is good, and nothing is unclean. But if anyone considers something to be unclean, there is also such a thing as medicine</span><span class="c0 c12">2</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;[&phi;&#940;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;], he says. For it is sanctified by the word of God, that is, by prayer. Moreover, it is stated earlier: For it is by the word and prayer made to God that it is sanctified.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 4:6-7</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Having laid these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and good doctrine which you have followed. Reject, moreover, old and profane fables</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">these things</span><span class="c0">. What things? Those concerning the mystery, those concerning the heresies, those concerning foods, which Paul mentioned. But see, he did not say, &quot;Commanding,&quot; but &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">Having laid</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; that is, giving counsel. For the bishop must be superior or noble.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">you will be a good servant</span><span class="c2 c0">. For he serves Christ who teaches those things which Christ desires to be taught.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">nourished by words of faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. As, Paul says, you do not depart from nourishment, so neither from these words. Or because you are nourished by spiritual nourishment in these things. Indeed, &quot;Man shall not live by bread alone.&quot; (Matt. 4:4) For you must not only remind your brothers of these things, but also nourish yourself with them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and good doctrine</span><span class="c2 c0">. For there is also the false doctrine of heretics.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">old and profane fables</span><span class="c0">.&quot; Paul refers to the Jewish observations. For these, in their own time, were useful, but now are old and rotten. He says the same about the Greek and heretical nonsense. Indeed, they are profane and impious, and the words of old men who have gone senile. Zeus, they say, had intercourse with Hera. And Ares committed adultery with Aphrodite</span><span class="c0 c12">3</span><span class="c2 c0">. And Hephaestus was thrown down from heaven.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 4:8-10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Train yourself to godliness; for physical exercise is of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come. This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. For to this end we both labor and suffer criticism, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all, especially of those who believe</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Train</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, accustom yourself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to godliness</span><span class="c2 c0">. Godliness is the diligence and zeal of life with right faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for physical exercise</span><span class="c2 c0">. It makes the body healthy. However, in comparison it is only for a short time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">having promise of the life</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you see the benefit? That godliness also in the present and in the future life gives life to the spiritual life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance</span><span class="c2 c0">. What kind? The one that gives life both here and there. And see that you yourself are also trustworthy, as if true, and acceptable to all; for in some things you are truly so, but in others doubtful. But because of the courage of the disciple, Paul speaks clearly throughout the entire Epistle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For to this end we both labor and suffer criticism</span><span class="c0">. For what purpose? &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">because we trust in the living God</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; And we too labor readily to be conscious of this, and for this very reason our enemies especially wage war against us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who is the Savior of all</span><span class="c2 c0">. He is the Savior of all here. But here, not of all, but of those worthy to be saved. And here, He especially cares for the faithful. For even though we are fought against by so many, we are saved. Paul encourages Timothy into dangers for the sake of the faith, having God as Savior.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Concerning his care, and that of the Church.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 4:11-16</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Command these things, and teach them. Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders. Study these things; give yourself entirely to them, so that your progress may be evident to all. Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them. For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Concerning those who err in knowledge, it is necessary to command them with authority; but concerning those who err in ignorance, to simply teach them. The one who encourages toward good, teaches; but the one who hinders evil, commands.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Let no one despise your youth</span><span class="c0">. For the bishop must also speak more authoritatively. Therefore, &quot;Let your forbearance be known to all men?&quot; (Phil. 4:5)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">And we say that, when he himself is wronged, he ought to be gentle; but when the brothers are wronged by sinning, he ought to be strict.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Or thus. If you live a most modest life, youth, which is easily prone to contempt, will not be despised.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but be an example to the believers</span><span class="c2 c0">. Like a living image, and a standard of good living. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in word</span><span class="c2 c0">, he says, in speaking, what is necessary for a teacher. But see that the teacher must have preparation of speech.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in conduct</span><span class="c2 c0">. For example, in life and in the practice of living.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in love</span><span class="c2 c0">. Which is towards all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in spirit</span><span class="c2 c0">. Either by spiritual rank or by the gift of the spirit, do not exalt yourself because of this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. The straight path by which one may unquestionably believe in God, even concerning the impossible.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in purity</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, holiness, abstinence, and self-discipline.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Until I come, give attention to reading</span><span class="c2 c0">. It was likely that Timothy himself, as if deprived of Paul, wished for him. Therefore, he comforts him in two ways, both with the promise of his coming and with the consoling Scriptures. But notice that Timothy is instructed to read, which we ought to do.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to exhortation</span><span class="c2 c0">. To the people.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Do not neglect the gift that is in you</span><span class="c2 c0">. This is, the teaching or the office of a bishop. For the grace of God was that the young man was worthy to become a pastor. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which was given to you through prophecy</span><span class="c2 c0">. For bishops were appointed by the command of the Spirit, and not randomly. But there is also a kind of prophecy that speaks of the present; as is said, &quot;Separate for me Barnabas and Saul.&quot; (Acts 13:2) </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">with the laying on of the hands of the elders</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says that the bishops are elders. For the elders would not have ordained the bishop.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Study these things</span><span class="c2 c0">. Which ones? Those that Paul mentioned above. In word, he says, in conduct, in faith, in purity. And from the frequent repetition of the same things, it shows that the bishop must unquestionably guard these things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">your progress may be evident to all</span><span class="c0">. But if the progress does not become very great, it would not become obvious. </span><span class="c0 c1">In all</span><span class="c2 c0">, either with people or with matters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Take regard to yourself</span><span class="c0">. That is, focus and apply your mind, not only for yourself but also for the sake of learning, so that you may benefit others as well. Then, giving precise instructions, Paul said, </span><span class="c0 c1">continue in them. For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you</span><span class="c2 c0">. For encouraging others, the one who encourages is also moved and benefited, becoming responsible for those whom he prevents from sinning. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">_______________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c17">Translator notes for 1 Timothy 4</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">1.

But therefore as brothers, so that you may recall their rashness to modesty.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">older women as mothers</span><span class="c2 c0">. &nbsp;Because of the said reason concerning the elders.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in all purity</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since even conversations with younger people hardly escape suspicion, you should do this with all purity, that is, not even to the slightest degree of favor.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&mdash; Otherwise. And not only to Timothy, but also to every overseer he gives advice.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">On the age, manner, and management of widows.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c5 c8">1 Timothy 5:3-8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Honor widows who are truly widows. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to manage their own household properly and to repay their elders. For this is acceptable in the sight of God. But the widow who is truly alone has hoped in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. But the one who lives in luxury has died while still living. And these things command, so that they may be blameless. But if anyone does not provide for his own, especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Why does Paul say nothing about virgins? Perhaps they were not in their prime. And who is the truly widowed woman, he goes on to say. He ordered that she herself be honored, because they have no husbands nor children, and the matter seems to be a curse for many. Therefore, he says, she should enjoy much honor from the priest, as if restoring the reproaches from others. Or Paul calls the honor the condition of necessities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">if any widow has children</span><span class="c2 c0">. These are not truly widows. For truly they are those who are isolated on all sides. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] </span><span class="c0 c1">to manage their own household properly</span><span class="c0">. That is, to arrange well. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and to repay their elders</span><span class="c2 c0">. See the wisdom of the blessed Paul. Often he also urges from human reasoning. For he says, since those before you were not able to give back the recompenses (for they died), through the descendants of those, your children, you should repay them the favors which you owed to those.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&mdash; And furthermore. That children and grandchildren should first learn to revere their own household; that is, that children and grandchildren should learn to honor their own mother and to nourish and treat her well. For this is what it means to revere. And also the ancestors, that is, the grandmother. Add also to the account that this is acceptable to God. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But the widow who is truly alone</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since Paul ordered that those who are truly widows to be honored, he now says what kind of women are truly widows, characterizing them in an explanation. He says she is isolated, both from children and from descendants. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">has hoped in God and continues in supplications and prayers</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, this is the true widow, who hopes in God and waits with prayers. For since she is abandoned of human help, it is reasonable that she turns to God.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But the one who lives in luxury has died while still living</span><span class="c0">. For many choose widowhood in order to act with greater authority in things that are not proper, Paul says: &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">But the one who lives in luxury</span><span class="c0">,&quot; that is, the one living in indulgence, &quot;though living, has died.&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c2">How? For life seems to be the life now. The eternal life has been lost. Therefore, she has died through sin, as far as eternal life is concerned.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">And these things command</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you see that Paul wants the matter to be as a law? For it does not permit abstaining from luxury as an achievement, but forbids it as a sin.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But if anyone does not provide for his own</span><span class="c0">. For personal virtue alone would not be sufficient for salvation, unless one also cares for others. Concerning the widow, Paul says these things. He calls those related by family &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">own</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For some are personal, like friends, but not necessarily family. Therefore, one must care for their own, especially for family members. Which the extravagant does not do, attending only to luxury.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">especially for those of his household</span><span class="c2 c0">. He takes care of both his own and those close to him, not only attending to what is appropriate but also to himself, by cutting off passions. Thus Clement says in the seventh Hypotyposes: &ldquo;He speaks of providence both concerning the soul and concerning the body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">he has denied the faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. And how does the one who wastes, and does not provide for both his own and his household, deny the faith? Because, it is said: &quot;And from your own seed you shall not be despised.&quot; (Isa. 58:7) But if you see God and do not deny Him, yet transgress His laws, you have denied God Himself. For it is said that they acknowledge God in words, but deny Him by their deeds. (Titus 1:16) How then is he worse than an unbeliever? Because although the unbelievers do not provide for everybody, at least they do so for their relatives, being led by the law of nature.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10" id="h.125rsdfme8u0"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 5:9-13</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Let a widow be counted as not less than sixty years old, the wife of one man, well attested for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has hosted strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has comforted the afflicted, if she has devoted herself to every good work. But refuse younger widows; for when they have indulged themselves against Christ, they desire to marry, having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith. And also they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; not only idle, but also gossips and chatterers, speaking things they ought not</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Here, Paul also considers age along with other factors, and previously he states the reason, saying that even if the age were sixty years old, without the other conditions being met, it should not be counted. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] They also say that Paul is referring to those designated for widowhood.

Having said generally, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">well attested for good works</span><span class="c0">,&quot; Paul then proceeds to each particular thing. And he said that the care of children is above. What then, if he has no children? Let him do the rest. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] He does not say &quot;if she had children,&quot; but &quot;if she has brought them up according to the will of God, if she has led them properly,&quot; for this is exceptional. One must understand that this is said concerning widows. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius G f. 295v</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">if she has hosted strangers</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you see that even here Paul places the benefits to one&#39;s own people before those to foreigners? For having said this first.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">if she has brought up children</span><span class="c2 c0">. Thus it suggests, &quot;She has hosted strangers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">if she has washed the feet of the saints</span><span class="c2 c0">. But he will say: I am very poor, and I do not have the means to be host or to assist the afflicted. Does he not say, &quot;Can you not wash the feet of the saints?&quot; Is the ability lacking to pursue good works? For Paul spoke of each of these according to what was available.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">if she washed the feet of the saints</span><span class="c2 c0">; that is, if she performed the lowest services to the saints without shame. Thus, Clement in the seventh book of Hypotyposes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">if she has devoted herself to every good work</span><span class="c2 c0">, that is, she has shared, supplied. For although the ability to act may be lacking, the ability to provide is nevertheless present.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But refuse younger widows</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, when the struggle becomes greater among virgins, nowhere does it seem to express the observation of time? Because they have come to this point from a greater fervor of faith, indeed a certain necessity follows which solitude brings. Or because, also speaking about virgins, that it should be constant and careful for those who belong to the Lord (1 Cor. 7:32), great diligence was applied.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for when they have indulged themselves against Christ</span><span class="c0">. Perhaps there were some who had acted this way. But see that truly widows are also joined to Christ: however, those who are joined to him are placed in the order of virgins. &quot;For I betrothed you, he says, to one husband, pure virgin, to present you to Christ.&quot; (2 Cor. 11:2) And these things are fitting for every Church. But what does it mean, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">when they have indulged themselves against</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot;? it means, when they become foolish, when they become pampered, that is, when they become arrogant, when they become proud over Christ, not accepting Him as a bridegroom, then they fall away into marriage. For they did not choose widowhood with a judgment of reason.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Because they have abandoned the first faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul speaks of the covenant with Christ. For they agreed to be joined to Christ: but they reject Him and turn to earthly marriages. After this, indeed, they fall into another sin, namely idleness. Therefore, he ordered not only men to work, but also women. For every evil arises from idleness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] </span><span class="c0 c1">And also they learn to be idle</span><span class="c0">. How do the idle women learn? Having the men who are brought in to assist them provide what is necessary for their old age, they are negligent about their tasks, but they take care to appear pleasing to the men. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">A f.172v; B f.208r; G f.296r</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not only idle, but also gossips</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the mind has been created by the Creator for us to work. Therefore, when we do not provide it with good work, it itself takes on absurd tasks.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c29"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 5:14-16</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Therefore, I wish the younger women to marry, bear children, manage the household, and give no opportunity to the adversary to have a cause for slander. For already some have turned aside after Satan. If a faithful man or woman has widows, let them be supported, and let the Church not be burdened, so that it may provide adequately for the truly widows.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The good aspect was that, once the widows were instructed, they should not abandon Christ nor reject their initial faith. But since they do this, let them marry, and let them not pledge themselves to Christ, and so let them marry. The former is blameless, the latter is unholy. For their arrogance and looseness of conduct are thus restrained, at least by greater affliction and concern.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and give no opportunity to the adversary</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if they marry correctly, not engaged to Christ beforehand, they will not expose themselves to the occasion of being slandered. Paul did not command them to live without fear in marrying, but that, pressed by cares, they should look to live modestly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For already some have turned aside after Satan</span><span class="c2 c0">. But why then did you pay such great attention to these things, and even more to those concerning the virgins? Because they, Paul says, gave occasion, turning away after Satan. For he says this not that there are no younger widows, but because he feared lest he might reject Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">If a faithful man</span><span class="c0">. He repeated: </span><span class="c0 c1">If a faithful man or woman has widows</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if they were unfaithful, it would not be necessary for them to be supported by them, lest the faithful appear to be in need of the unfaithful. Moreover, the laws also concern those who obey them, not those who are not subject to them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">let him provide for them</span><span class="c2 c0">. Let the matter be done lightly. For through this, let them support, Paul meant the necessary nourishment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that the Church is not burdened</span><span class="c2 c0">. So the faithful, supporting their own widows, also contribute to the widows of the Church. Just as the Church, not being burdened, and for this reason nourishing more abundantly those it nourishes, namely truly the widows, that is, those unprotected and isolated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and that those who are truly widows</span><span class="c2 c0">. Truly widows are those who are abandoned on all sides. For he who does this, Paul says, not only supports them if he provides for them, but also greatly helps the rest, granting them relief.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 5:17-21</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, &quot;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,&quot; and, &quot;The worker deserves his wages.&quot; Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful. I seriously charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels to keep these instructions without bias, and to do nothing out of favoritism</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Who then are the ones who lead well, Christ declared. &quot;The good Shepherd,&quot; he says, &quot;lays down his life for the sheep.&quot; (Jn. 10:11)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">are to be considered worthy of double honor</span><span class="c0">. Paul calls the necessary provision an honor, or rather a contribution. &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain</span><span class="c0">,&quot; and, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">The worker deserves his wages</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span><span class="c2 c25">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">double</span><span class="c2 c0">. But truly, with a double comparison made to widows, not to elders who do not rule well. For they do not even deserve simple honor, but rather must be expelled. Or he says double means much.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">those who labor in preaching</span><span class="c0">. Preach, not the boastful kind, but that which has the power to nourish spiritually. But where now are those who say that the leader does not need words or teaching, but life? Let them now hear how Paul honors the word [&lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&nu;], especially preaching. For even this, if from some other. For when the word is about doctrines, where then does life have power? And see the contrast to, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For indeed, one who is threshing must be muzzled.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">The worker deserves his wages</span><span class="c2 c0">. Even Christ speaks in accordance with the law. By wages, he means food, and by worker, he means the one who labors, namely that one who does not labor is unworthy of food. This, however, Paul says to teachers who do not labor in teaching. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Do not receive an accusation against an elder</span><span class="c2 c0">. What then? Should such an accusation be admitted against the younger? By no means! But as if he were saying: Against no one, and especially not against the elder; for they have, even from their very age, a certain restraint; therefore he calls him an elder [&pi;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&beta;&#973;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;] who is old in age.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all</span><span class="c2 c0">. For he seeks carefully, Paul says, and when he finds, he reproaches with severity. For this is the rebuke. Before all, so that the rest may also be admonished. This, God did, both upon Pharaoh (Ex. 19) and upon Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 4).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I seriously charge you before God</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul warns of severity. For Timothy did not simply resign, but protested, securing himself in case anything improper should happen. But why did Paul call the Father and the Son as witnesses, and also angels together? Because they, along with their Lord who is to come in judgment, are present and will bear witness to the discourse. It is also our custom to call both superiors and inferiors as witnesses. And Jacob also took God and the mountain as witnesses. (Gen. 31:46) </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and the elect angels</span><span class="c2 c0">. He said &quot;elect angels,&quot; because angels and demons alike are cast away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] Either he spoke what was truly the case, or he brought them to the brink of ruin. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 173v; B f. 209&tau;; G f. 297r</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to keep these instructions without bias</span><span class="c2 c0">. This, for example, is what he said: Without haste in judgment, that is, so that you do nothing rashly or recklessly from what has been said, and not without preceding judgment or counsel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and to do nothing out of favoritism</span><span class="c2 c0">. Indeed, presumptions are often devoid of truth. For favoritism [&pi;&rho;&#972;&sigma;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;] is an affectation that incites someone to do something without judgment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">without bias</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, without falling into the judgment and punishment of disobedience for someone who has erred in something. Thus Clement in the seventh book of Hypotyposes. And Basil, in his interpretation of the Proverbs, says, According to inclination, that is, not leaning towards what is wrong, but bringing forth straight judgment. For he says thus: Doing nothing according to inclination, but bringing forth judgments straight and unaltered.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 5:22-23</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Do not quickly lay hands on anyone, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. No longer drink water but use a little wine for your stomach and your frequent ailments</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And Paul discusses the matter of selecting for ordinations. For he wrote to a bishop. And he says, </span><span class="c0 c1">do not quickly</span><span class="c2 c0">, for example, not from the first or second thoughts, but after examining many times and thoroughly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">nor share in the sins of others</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, appointing a bishop that is unworthy of the people.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Keep yourself pure</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul commands Timothy concerning self-control. But if a man so exhausts himself with fasting and drinking water that he even falls ill from it, what ought we to do, or how should we observe this?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">No longer drink water</span><span class="c2 c0">. And why did Paul not heal his stomach, who also worked physical healings, but wanted him to be healed by diet? So that it might serve as a reminder to us not to be easily offended if good men were weakened: and so that Timothy himself might be kept in office through illness, lest he become proud. Finally, so that we might know that since they were of the same nature as us, those good works were performed which they did: since Paul could have healed him with a single prayer, but it was not altogether beneficial. Chrysostom has much to say on this matter. Therefore, see the book in which he discusses Images, and you will see very beautifully what has been treated on this subject by the divine Chrysostom in that place, in the introductory verse, as I understand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but use a little wine</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, only as much as is necessary for health: for Paul knows that even an excess of wine can be harmful. From this, it is indicated that Timothy was ill not only in the stomach but also in other parts of the body.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 5:24-25</span><span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;The sins of certain people are obvious, leading to judgment; and for some, they also follow. Likewise, good deeds are evident; and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since he said above, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">nor share in the sins of others</span><span class="c0">,&quot; (1 Tim. 5:22) he resolves what was said as if in contrast.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">For what reason, Timothy would say, if I were to ignore the sins of the one being ordained, would I share in them? And he says: &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">The sins of certain people are obvious, leading to judgment</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; Therefore, if you diligently investigate sins, you will fully understand them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and for some, they also follow</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, they follow after the ordination. Therefore, you would have communicated to the former: for it would be negligence not to know what is obvious. But not so with the latter, for nothing is from you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] I know that I have read an interpretation of this kind among certain saints: those whose sins go before are visible to all; therefore, let there be some for you as well, but observe those that follow with watchful eyes.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">If therefore you do anything besides this, you will share in sins. But Saint Basil has interpreted it in such a way as if nothing of this chapter pertains to ordination. Whoever, he says, has sinned against him alone, their sins have preceding and trailing judgment.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">However many, even after they have departed from the church, have left occasions for sinning to others, just as Nestorius and other heretics; these sins follow them even after they have gone: for even the sins of those who fall are attributed to them because of them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Likewise, good deeds are evident</span><span class="c0">. That is, in the same way. Whatever, he says, has been said about sins, accept also this about good deeds. For there are those who have become the occasion of salvation for others, and the righteous works of these are also attributed to those who have sown the seeds.

Do not let the fact that you are a brother be the cause of your despising, Paul says, but considering that the masters are faithful and beloved of God, serve more, mixing fear and love. For as much as you do good to the masters who are your brothers, so much more become grateful in serving more. Or because you are benefited by the masters, through being nourished and clothed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but rather serve them all the more</span><span class="c0">; that is, the slaves.

He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, strife, blasphamies, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are immoral in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Depart from such people. But godliness with gladness is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">If anyone teaches otherwise</span><span class="c2 c0">: that is, one different from what is right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and to the teaching that accords with godliness</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paule said, &quot;They are sound words,&quot; and he says, &quot;And with the teaching accords with godliness,&quot; evidently concerning faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">he is inflated with conceit and understands nothing</span><span class="c2 c0">. For he who does not know what he ought to know, knows nothing. But he who does not know the sound things, obviously knows the demonic things. Moreover, arrogance is a matter welcoming and proper to demons.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if you do not believe, but craving for controversy, there must be debate and conflicts of reasoning. Since Christianity promises future things, and these cannot be shown to the eyes, faith is necessary. But see that to crave controversy is to be ill.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">blasphemies</span><span class="c2 c0">. For it is necessary that human reasoning permit what pertains to God, and that blasphemy arises from questioning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">evil suspicions</span><span class="c2 c0">. These are opinions and contaminated doctrines.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">friction</span><span class="c2 c0">. The transmission of the disease of bad doctrines, from the contact of miserable sheep. For those who come into contact are filled with the disease, along with the healthy ones.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">imagining that godliness is a means of gain</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you know that even battles of words produce shameful profit? It is no wonder, for those who contend with words attract more students, making a profit from them, whether monetary gain. They pretend virtue in order to amass wealth through it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Depart from such people</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Paul did not say, &quot;Join with such men and fight,&quot; but &quot;depart,&quot; after one and then a second warning. For how will you ever be able to persuade men fighting for money? Therefore, since they are persistent, turn away from them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But godliness with gladness is great gain</span><span class="c2 c0">. They indeed imagine godliness in such a way that it serves as a means for gain and profit. But true profit is godliness itself in its own nature, and having what is sufficient, not seeking those things that abound in earthly goods. Or rather, what profit is godliness itself if we do not seek more, but remain in sufficiency. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For we brought nothing into the world</span><span class="c2 c0">. If we have brought nothing in, and we can take nothing out, what need is there to have more than what is necessary?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But if we have food and clothing</span><span class="c2 c0">. One must eat as much as is sufficient to nourish, not as much as to create luxury; and one must have as much clothing and such as to cover nakedness, not as many as to create extravagance and folly for those who bear them. For this indicates the nature of food and clothing.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 6:9-12</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, some of which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all evils; by craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains. But you, O man of God, flee these things; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of eternal life, to which you were called, and you made the good confession before many witnesses</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Paul does not speak of those who use wealth well, but of those who desire it. And the desirer would not share it with another, so that the things of desire would not be diminished for him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who desire to be rich</span><span class="c2 c0">. For wealth flows abundantly, and having power, it leads to unreasonable desires.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">some of which plunge people</span><span class="c2 c0">. To the point of no recovery anymore.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">some have wandered away</span><span class="c2 c0">. For desire darkens the eye of the soul and does not allow it to walk straight.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and pierced themselves</span><span class="c2 c0">. For greed, like a thorn, causes the hands of the one who touches to bleed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">with many pains</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not only, Paul says, does the desire to be rich obstruct matters concerning God, but it also physically weakens the lovers, surrounding them with cares, sleeplessness, and fears.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But you, O man of God</span><span class="c2 c0">. Great is the dignity. For all men are servants of God, especially the righteous, not only according to the reason of creation, but also according to that of adoption.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">flee these things</span><span class="c2 c0">. Both with emphasis; for Paul did not say, &quot;Avoid this one, but approach that one,&quot; but rather, &quot;Flee and pursue.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">pursue righteousness</span><span class="c2 c0">. To have no more than is sufficient for life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">godliness</span><span class="c2 c0">. In doctrines.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. Without controversies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">love</span><span class="c0">. The offspring of faith, towards God and men. The order of the statement is good. For from </span><span class="c0 c1">faith</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c1">love</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is born; and from love, </span><span class="c0 c1">patience</span><span class="c0">. And patience, as it walks, makes </span><span class="c0 c1">gentleness</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Fight the good fight of faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. The fight of faith, both what has been said, and the courageous one in trials. And immediately the reward of such a fight, eternal life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to which you were called</span><span class="c2 c0">. For everyone who comes to baptism is called to this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the good confession</span><span class="c2 c0">. Rather confession, it refers to that in baptism, when we confess to renounce the Devil and to join and believe in Christ.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">A command about purity, obedience until the end.</span></p><p class="c3 c10" id="h.d23lagr66xyt"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 6:13-16</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I charge you before God, who gives life to all things, and Christ Jesus, who testified before Pontius Pilate the good confession, to keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; which in its own times he will show, the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see; to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Again Paul makes God a witness, both increasing the fear and making the disciple more secure, because he has in mind the one who was witnessed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who gives life to all things</span><span class="c0">. This is also a comfort against dangers. For if God, Paul says, gives life to all things, why should we fear the struggles for faith? And that He encourages this is clear from what follows, </span><span class="c0 c1">Jesus Christ, who testified before Pontius Pilate</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if the Master testified, why do we delay? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Who testified before Pontius Pilate</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">For Jesus testified concerning what he was doing, that he himself is the Christ, the Son of God. Therefore, Clement in the seventh book of Hypotyposes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the good confession</span><span class="c2 c0">. What good confession does it speak of? In a somewhat mysterious way, however, Jesus confessed that he is God. For when Pilate said, &quot;Are you a king?&quot; he said, &quot;For this I was born.&quot; (Jn. 18:37)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to keep the commandment without spot</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, neither tainted by doctrines nor by conduct.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">until the appearing</span><span class="c2 c0">. Until, Paul says, your last breath. But he did not say it thus. However, in order to stir him more greatly, he remembered the Lord&#39;s appearance, and the dreadful glory.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which in its own times</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, to the appropriate, the appointed times. Therefore, do not be upset that it has not already happened.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the blessed and only Sovereign</span><span class="c2 c0">. These things have been said about the Son. For the one who is coming shows the presence. But the Father will not come, but the Son, for judgment; these things have been said concerning the one who is coming.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the blessed</span><span class="c2 c0">, the self-blessedness. For all sorrow and pain have fled from him. Jesus is both a ruler and a good king. Therefore, the earthly ones should not be feared by us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and only Sovereign</span><span class="c0">. Where you might hear about one of the three holy Persons, this or that one alone, do not accept what is said of the other two by way of contrast, but rather about those who do not exist, yet are called gods. For behold, now speaking about the Son these things, which elsewhere have also been said about the Father and about the Spirit, He said, The </span><span class="c0 c1">Only</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] </span><span class="c0 c1">who alone has immortality</span><span class="c0">. How does he say about God that He alone has immortality, when both angels and souls and demons have immortality? Therefore, when he says about God: &quot;Who alone has immortality,&quot; he either takes away immortality from those we mentioned, or he lies. And we say that those about whom the address is do not have immortality, but they partake in it, by the grace of Him who alone by nature is immortal. For this has been given to them by God. For God is the one from whom we all partake, just as we do with other things, so immortality is compared to that which is more excellent. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 15&nu;; B f. 211&nu;; G f. 300r</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">dwelling in unapproachable light</span><span class="c0">. Which itself is immortality and inaccessible light, do you think it is limited to a place? Is light one thing and the light itself another? Yet it is the light itself. Do you see that when we want to say something great, the tongue becomes powerless? It is truly called unapproachable because no one can approach the shining mind, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">whom no man has seen</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For no one has seen the divinity of the Son, just as neither the Father nor the Spirit; for he was seen according to the flesh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to whom be honor and eternal power</span><span class="c2 c0">. If his honor and power will be eternal, certainly his appearance will be as well. For he promised: &quot;And behold, I am with you all the days.&quot; (Matt. 28:20)</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">A guide for the wealthy towards true life.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 6:17-19</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">To the rich, in this present age, command not to be arrogant, nor to hope in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment; to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may obtain eternal life</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">For there are also other rich men, but not in this age. The truly rich are the righteous ones, that is.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not to be arrogant</span><span class="c2 c0">, Paul says. For nothing so much inflates and exalts the mind as money and possessions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">nor to hope in uncertain riches</span><span class="c2 c0">. See how he insults them, and how foolish they are. For who hopes for something uncertain?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but in the living God</span><span class="c2 c0">. For Paul says that he who hopes in God is not disappointed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment</span><span class="c2 c0">. For he, to whom all things common belong, has given abundantly and freely: heaven, earth, air, life, food. But greed, having taken tyranny as a partner, has seized many of the common things and made them private.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to do good, to be rich in good works</span><span class="c2 c0">. If you seek wealth, seek true wealth, not uncertain. What are these? Goods, Paul says, are easy to distribute; for this is the nature of money.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to be generous</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, gentle, friendly, modest, and humble.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">storing up for themselves</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, laying down, Paul says, a good foundation. Where the foundation is good, all is safe and secure.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that they may obtain eternal life</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, for this life, one must lay up the foundation. But how could this be? If by doing good here, we lay up for ourselves the foundation and security of this life. For the practice of good works, which Paul also called a foundation, is able to grant the enjoyment of that life.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">1 Timothy 6:20-21</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">O Timothy, guard what has been delivered to you, avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of falsely called knowledge, which some professing have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">guard what has been delivered to you</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says the commandment of God, which he delivered to you through me; or the grace of the Spirit, which he received through the laying on of hands.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">avoiding profane and vain babblings</span><span class="c0">. The impure, the defiled. Vain babblings, however, are pointless words, therefore empty sound is not profane. But Blessed John called the recent admonitions novelties of voices, reading as it seems &ldquo;vain babblings&rdquo; [&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&omicron;&phi;&omega;&nu;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;], through the diphthong and the written &quot;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;,&quot; as the first</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">syllable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and oppositions</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, there is an opposition to which one must not respond, because of its nonsense.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">of falsely called knowledge</span><span class="c2 c0">. For when there is no faith, there is no knowledge. And that which seems to be, is false.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which some professing</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says that the knowledge is false and forbidden. For perhaps some were claiming knowledge discovered from human reasoning, which was opposed to faith. And it is obvious from this that they have suffered shipwreck concerning the faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Grace be with you. Amen</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul prays for the seal or signet of all things, namely the grace of God, from which all which is good is both given and preserved.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The end, with divine assistance, of the first Epistle to Timothy. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">It was written from Laodicea, which is a metropolis of Phrygia and Pacatiana.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c18">COMMENTARY ON 2 TIMOTHY</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c18">BY OECUMENIUS</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">HYPOTHESIS ON THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Paul sends this from Rome. The pretext of the Epistle is this: Since those who had accompanied Paul on his journey left him, the Apostle, wishing Timothy to come to him, writes the Epistle. And first, he shows that he remembers Timothy&rsquo;s devotion and the faith of his ancestors. Then he states that those from Asia, namely Phygelus and Hermogenes, have turned away from him, seeing his chains. But he bears witness to the greatest zeal only in Onesiphorus, and he received him when he came to Rome and stayed with him. Paul commands Timothy to avoid foolish disputes, because from them arise quarrels. For Hymenaeus and Philetus also turned aside in this way, departing from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened, and they overturn some people; therefore, Paul rather encourages Timothy to pay attention to himself and to the teaching, and to know that in the last times there will be men lovers of themselves, and of pleasures rather than of God, and foreseeing these things, to safeguard the people lest anyone be deceived by them. And having urged him much concerning morals and the accuracy of the teaching, and indicating that the time of his departure is at hand and that he is about to be offered as a drink offering and to bear witness, he instructed him to come to him quickly, bringing the cloak and the books. Paul warns Timothy about Alexander the coppersmith and to be on guard, as he indicated many things to him, and thus he concludes the Epistle.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">THEODORET</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">What then does the Second Epistle to Timothy say? In the first, Paul said, &quot;I hope to come to you soon.&quot; He was not able to go. For he was already held captive by Nero. Therefore, knowing this, instead of his presence, he sent letters, at once comforting him regarding his not coming, and at the same time encouraging Timothy, who was thus entrusted with the care of the Church.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">The Second Epistle to Timothy by the Apostle Paul</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c16"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c16">CHAPTER 1</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 1:1-2</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus, to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am </span><span class="c0 c1">an apostle</span><span class="c0">, Paul says, appointed </span><span class="c0 c1">to the promised life which is in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c2 c0">, that is, to be given through Christ Jesus in the future.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">according to the promise of life</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul said, Let us not recall present dangers: let life proceed according to these promises. Therefore, since it is promised, he says, seek it there. From the prologue, he comforts Timothy in his own trials. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [THEODORET] &quot;The Lord God,&quot; Paul says, &quot;appointed me as an apostle, along with Christ, so that I might proclaim to men the promised eternal life.&quot; </span><span class="c0 c1">[end of the excerpt by Theodoret</span><span class="c0">] &mdash;</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">my beloved child</span><span class="c2 c0">. &nbsp;For Timothy is indeed a child, and certainly beloved. If he were not very virtuous, he would not be both a child, beloved, and especially of Paul.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Grace, mercy</span><span class="c2 c0">. Which even before, he prays these things for himself now as well.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">The praise of Timothy&#39;s faith, and appeal to patience, according to what grace requires, in which he also says that he himself is led by enduring.</span></p><p class="c3 c10" id="h.pv673fx28lb3"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 1:3-6</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I give thanks to God, whom I have served from my ancestors with a pure conscience, that I unceasingly remember you in my prayers day and night, longing to see you, mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy; taking reminder of the sincere faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that it is also in you. For this reason, I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Do you see the excess of love? Paul says, I thank God that I remember you. This is love, when someone takes pride in loving someone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">with a pure conscience</span><span class="c0">. How is it in a pure conscience? Where Paul originally was ignorant of Christ? They show that he was conscious of nothing evil in himself. For even if he persecuted, he persecuted out of zeal, and not according to human reasoning, like many who do so for glory, forming heresy; those who are conscious know great corruption.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">And he presents himself well, so that he may also show that his love for Timothy is genuine, and not receive the reputation of being unloving, not having gone to him, and promising these things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">unceasingly remember you</span><span class="c0">. Not just unceasingly remember you, but &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c1">In my prayers</span><span class="c0">.&quot; Not in a common way, Paul says, as I remember, but in prayers, both </span><span class="c0 c1">night and day</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3" id="h.jjx3ypxiowb7"><span class="c0 c1">longing to see you</span><span class="c0">. Therefore, I did not voluntarily deprive myself of such great pleasure. You are truly worthy to be loved, both because of your tears and because of your faith and that of your ancestors. But notice that at the beginning Paul does not want to sadden Timothy as if he were not coming, but rather gives hope of seeing him: near the end, however, he implies that he will no longer see him in the flesh, saying: &quot;For I am already being sacrificed, or offered.&quot; (2 Tim. 4:6) But here is the order: I have grace from God because I remember you, desiring to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. Then what is left in the middle: &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">mindful of your tears</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; Afterwards, lest it seem rash to love, Paul also adds the reason.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">mindful</span><span class="c0">, Paul says, </span><span class="c0 c1">of your tears</span><span class="c0">. For perhaps, being separated from Paul, Timothy was so distressed as even to weep. But the exceeding,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">longing to see you so that I may be filled with joy</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; as if the mere sight alone were sufficient to fill me with joy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">reminder of the sincere faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. I remembered you, Paul says, in my prayers, recalling both your tears and your sincere faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">first in your grandmother</span><span class="c2 c0">. Another praise: that the lineage on the grandmother&#39;s side was not from Greeks, but from Jews who believed in Christ. And his father, being a Greek, was circumcised because of the fear of the Jews.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and your mother</span><span class="c2 c0">. The praises of our ancestors, when we also partake in them, come to our glory: but if we are alienated from them, they condemn us more: however, this one was a partaker.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and I am persuaded that it is also in you</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, you rightly have this as sincere, since it is established from above and cannot be shaken.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For this reason</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since I am conscious of these things, Paul says.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">you to rekindle the gift of God</span><span class="c2 c0">. &nbsp;Timothy had received the spiritual gift, and Paul urges that it be carried out with readiness of mind, attention, and vigilance more vehemently and effectively. For the opposites of these make it relaxed, as it is said elsewhere: &quot;Do not extinguish the Spirit.&quot; (1 Thess. 5:19)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">through the laying on of my hands</span><span class="c2 c0">. For as soon as Paul laid his hands on Timothy, appointing him bishop, a gift also came upon Timothy for the working of signs, for teaching, and for presiding over the Church.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 1:7-9</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of discipline. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but share in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God, who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">How then shall I rekindle the gift of God? If I stand honorable against temptations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For God has not given us a spirit of fear</span><span class="c0">. For there is a spirit or gift of fear, as it is said in the books of the Kings</span><span class="c0 c12">2</span><span class="c2 c0">: And the spirit of fear fell upon them, where it was altogether necessary to fear. (2 Chron. 17:10) But to us, Paul says, a gift of power has been given.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but of power</span><span class="c2 c0">. Which is against temptations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and of love</span><span class="c2 c0">. &nbsp;Which is towards the brethren.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and of discipline</span><span class="c2 c0">. Concerning a proper life. And in all these things, we must also include our own eagerness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord</span><span class="c2 c0">. Many miserable people, examining the mystery according to human reasoning, say it is a shame to preach the Son of God crucified, not knowing what was accomplished through the cross and the death of the Lord. You, therefore, Paul says, do not be ashamed of the testimony, that is, the cross of Christ, but proclaim it boldly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">nor of me His prisoner</span><span class="c2 c0">. Nor should you be ashamed that you have as a teacher one who is bound. For if Christ did not find shame to be crucified, neither do I for the chains.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but share in the sufferings</span><span class="c0">. And do not only be unashamed, but also endure hardship with me; that is, if it is necessary for you to suffer such things for the sake of the Gospel, do not have fear. For this is what he also indicated above where Paul says, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For do you say that you have suffered by your own power? God gave and will give such power; you only introduced the willingness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who has saved us</span><span class="c0">. Then also concerning the cooperation of God and the power, which makes one bravely endure temptations and suffering, Paul states the proofs. He </span><span class="c0 c1">saved us</span><span class="c0">, he says, from the death of sin, and called us with a holy calling, having wandered away, not because we were worthy of the calling, but because God himself did this by his own purpose and grace.</span><span class="c23">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Who then, he said (for this is the opinion), while we were enemies, had such feelings towards us, much more so when we have become friends, and wish to be afflicted on that account. God will give the power to become virtuous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c0">. It shows that the salvation given to us by grace through Christ (this he says </span><span class="c0 c1">in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c2 c0">) was predestined beforehand before the ages.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 1:10-14</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Now revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel, for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles. For this reason I suffer as I do, but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. Hold to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Already long ago it was prefigured that we would be saved, but now it has been revealed through the incarnation of our Savior God. For such is the will of God, that the world should be saved through faith, now and not at another time, it has now been revealed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who abolished death</span><span class="c2 c0">. To the one who forgives sin, and granted resurrection.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">life and immortality to light</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, revealing. The word is worthy of life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Paul says, </span><span class="c0 c1">through the Gospel</span><span class="c2 c0">. For through it, both eternal life and resurrection have been made clear.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for which I was appointed</span><span class="c2 c0">. First, he says what is, then he also implies this: You must also go to the Gentiles. Moreover, he also makes the statement more credible.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For this reason I suffer as I do</span><span class="c2 c0">. What then is that reason? Because I am a messenger and an Apostle. As if he were saying: I am not being overcome as a criminal and dragged to prison.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but I am not ashamed</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the greatest glory is to suffer something for Christ. Do you see how Paul prepares the disciple for afflictions? You will show that if someone does not fear to be ashamed, the danger itself will be easier with the help of Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that he is able to guard my deposit</span><span class="c0">. He calls the faith a deposit [&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&theta;&#942;&kappa;&eta;&nu;], which Christ entrusted [&pi;&alpha;&rho;&#941;&theta;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;] to him to preach. Either Paul means the believers, whom God entrusted to him to teach, or those whom he entrusted to God. &quot;Behold, I entrust you to the Lord.&quot; (Acts 20:32) Among those entrusted is also Timothy. Therefore, Paul says: &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Hold to the pattern of sound teaching</span><span class="c0">. Like an image, likeness, imitation. &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">of sound teaching</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; those concerning faith and life. As I suppose concerning others, they are not sound.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that you have heard from me</span><span class="c2 c0">. He did not assign to the disciple only epistles to be made, but also gave instructions orally in his presence. For thus he acted in all things as well. Therefore, let no one think that anything is lacking in the epistles, because they do not discuss everything.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in faith and love</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the words and teachings came into being in faith and love given to him through Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Guard the good deposit</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul calls the faith and the care of the Church entrusted to him a deposit. Then he shows that human strength is not enough to guard so much. For there are many obstacles. Therefore, he indicates the way of guarding. &quot;Guard,&quot; he says, &quot;through the Holy Spirit.&quot; As if he said: Strive to have the Spirit abiding in you, and do not cast it away through bad conduct, and you will guard the deposit. &quot;For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain; unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.&quot; (Psalm 127:1)</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Disadvantages of the transmission of divine dogmas.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 1:15-17</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">You know this, that all who are in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often restored me, and was not ashamed of my chains. But when he was in Rome, he diligently sought me out and found me; (may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day); and you yourself know how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus better than I do</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Paul is tested not to be overcome, but to teach endurance in similar trials. For when he was arrested by Nero, his friends in Asia abandoned him. There were many in Rome from Asia who followed Paul or were otherwise faithful. But all of them distanced themselves after his arrest by Nero.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that all who are in Asia</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, those from Asia.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">May the Lord grant mercy</span><span class="c2 c0">. Notice Paul&rsquo;s eagerness. He did not curse those who abandoned him, but only recounted what they did against him; but he prays much for the one who helped him, and not only for him alone, but also for his household. Therefore, they were virtuous, and so Onesiphorus educated them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">of the household of Onesiphorus</span><span class="c2 c0">. O blessed Onesiphorus! who was deemed worthy to restore Paul, may a part of you be with us also.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for he often restored me</span><span class="c2 c0">. Just like an athlete seized by the hardship of the struggle. And he was not ashamed of my chains. Leaving aside the dangers, he put forward the shame, persuading the student to be courageous. As if shame alone arises from the matter, and not danger approaching; although indeed danger was also present. For Nero raged against Paul as if one of his own household had instructed him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">he diligently sought me out</span><span class="c0">. Not only, Paul says, did he not avoid my presence, although there was danger and he encountered me after being imprisoned, but he also sought me more earnestly than he owed until he found me. And those who share in the sufferings with the saints will also share in the crowns, as Paul himself says.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot;Well done, having shared my suffering.&quot; (Philip. 4:14)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord</span><span class="c0">. Those who hold the opinions of Marcion leap over [&#7952;&pi;&iota;&pi;&eta;&delta;&#8182;&sigma;&iota;]</span><span class="c0 c12">3</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;the Scripture, as if there were two Lords, but it says the Lord elsewhere. &ldquo;But for us there is one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things.&quot; (1 Cor. 8:6) What then shall we say? This construction is common in the divine Scripture. Just as it is said, Abraham said, &quot;Abraham shall not enter,&quot; as if he said, &quot;May the Lord grant him to find mercy with him.&quot; And if both the Father and the Son are indicated here, accept it, it is not even inappropriate. For both the Father and the Son are Lord, and the Spirit is Lord, but the one Lord is revealed in the three persons. &quot;The Lord said to my Lord.&quot; (Ps. 110:1) That is, it is clarified to say thus the holy substances, as there: &quot;The Lord rained fire and brimstone from the Lord.&quot; (Gen. 19:24)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to find mercy</span><span class="c2 c0">. But if Onesiphorus needs mercy in order to be saved, how much more do we? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">he ministered to me at Ephesus</span><span class="c2 c0">. He always served, in Ephesus, in Rome. For the earnest man must always be an example in works.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">________________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Translator notes for 2 Timothy chapter 1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">1.

But be strengthened, Paul says, not only by my example, but also through the grace given through Christ. For if he did not justify by his own blood, the grace of the Spirit would not have come. Therefore, he says, have the Spirit as an ally.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and the things you have heard from me among many witnesses</span><span class="c0">. That is, I did not tell you in secret, but openly in the presence of many. This, however, speaks about preaching. </span><span class="c0 c1">to faithful men</span><span class="c0">, Paul says, not to curious investigators, nor to those reasoning by conflict, but to those who do not betray what is entrusted to them. However, he does not say: Speak, but, </span><span class="c0 c1">entrust</span><span class="c2 c0">.

No one engaged in warfare gets entangled in the affairs of life, so that he may please the one who joined him. And if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. The hardworking farmer must be the first to receive a share of the crops</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! Is it so great a thing to be a soldier of Christ? But the mark of a soldier is to endure hardship.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">No one engaged in warfare</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul remembered the soldier, showing that the servant of Christ must be eager and bold; and as an athlete, showing that he needs continuous training. If, therefore, he says, the one serving the earthly king is not entangled in matters that distract him from his weapons, how much more the one who has committed himself to the heavenly king and recruited.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">unless he competes according to the rules</span><span class="c2 c0">. For it is not enough merely to be anointed, or to enter the place of combat, or to engage in hand-to-hand fighting with the enemy, but it is also necessary to endure and to win: for this is the law of combat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">The hardworking farmer</span><span class="c2 c0">.

For may the Lord give you understanding in everything. Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David according to my Gospel, in which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal, but the word of God is not imprisoned. Therefore, I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation, which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since Paul spoke everything in parables, those of the soldier, those of the athlete, those of the farmer, he says: </span><span class="c0 c1">Understand what I say</span><span class="c2 c0">. For whose sake does he say this? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in everything</span><span class="c2 c0">, Paul says, so that you may also understand these things as you ought, and do the other things as you must. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Remember Jesus Christ, risen</span><span class="c2 c0">. At the same time, Paul also makes the argument against heretics stronger and stimulates discussion: showing that Christ, through suffering, came and conquered death by death.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">of the seed of David</span><span class="c2 c0">. For already some heretics from that time denied the privilege of God, who considered it a disgrace that the Son of God should suffer, and therefore perhaps introduced unbelievable ideas, not knowing that He had given this as a sign of His highest kindness and goodness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">according to my Gospel</span><span class="c2 c0">. For even false apostles preached the Gospel, but badly, as my Gospel, he says, confirms.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in which I suffer hardship</span><span class="c2 c0">. The afflictions of Paul reveal the truth of the Gospel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">even to imprisonment as a criminal</span><span class="c2 c0">. For who, indeed, would choose to suffer such things unless preaching the truth, and about whom he would not be made altogether more certain?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but the word of God is not imprisoned</span><span class="c2 c0">. And if I, Paul says, am imprisoned, the preaching is not imprisoned at the same time, but it goes about. For the tongue speaks with imprisoned hands. Indeed, the only prison of the tongue is fear and unbelief. This, however, he also says to the exhortation of those who were free. For if I who am imprisoned preach, what pardon can be given to those who are free and yet neglect? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for the sake of the elect</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the sake of the faithful, Paul says, whom God has chosen: for since God chose them, I must suffer everything for them, because God also suffered for us, and indeed there is some kind of repentance and reward: so that they also, just as we, he says, may obtain salvation. And as if he were saying: Certainly, I could live far from dangers, if I only cared for myself; but I suffer these things for the good of others, so that they may obtain salvation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which is in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c2 c0">. Someone might say: If you yourself cannot obtain salvation, but behold, you are about to die, how will you secure salvation for others? Paul replied: I am not speaking of this earthly life, but of that which is in Christ Jesus, that is, what is given through Christ, what is eternal, what is future with glory. For the salvation of the world has no glory.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">On faith in Christ, and tolerance for the hope of life.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timohty 2:11-15</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">The saying is trustworthy. For if we have died with him, we will also live with him. If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. If we are faithless, he remains faithful. He cannot deny himself. These things he reminds you of, sincerely charging you before the Lord not to quarrel about words to no profit, which leads to the ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">The saying is trustworthy</span><span class="c2 c0">. Those who are chosen obtain glorious and eternal salvation. For some have doubted concerning the resurrection, and this assurance was needed. That the saying is trustworthy is also established from reasoning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For if we have died with Christ</span><span class="c0">, (by which I mean death both through baptism and through sufferings, this indeed being the sensible one,) </span><span class="c0 c1">we shall also reign with him</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For no one, Paul says, who has shared in sorrows with others can be deprived of good things and prosperity: let alone Christ, who is goodness and kindness itself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">If we deny him, he also will deny us</span><span class="c2 c0">. Then also fear them who are evil. But consider what is likely to happen to one who is denied by Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">If we are faithless, he remains faithful</span><span class="c0">. If we are faithless concerning that he rose from the dead, or that he is God, he remains faithful, that is, true. For having said that he will rise, and that he is God (for this was signified in many ways), he is faithful. For he rose and he is God. He says that he cannot deny himself, so as not to be God or to have risen. Just as he said: There will be no change because of our denial, but he remains faithful and true concerning himself. And to deny, that is, to lie to himself, he cannot do, in not having risen or not being God. For having promised concerning himself, he cannot lie to himself and fail to fulfill the promises. For neither by believing do we make him not God, nor by being unfaithful do we cast out the divine nature, but both in our believing and in our unbelief he himself is God. Therefore, we who believe reap the benefit. But the &quot;It is not possible,&quot; instead of, &quot;It is not permitted.&quot; &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">He remains faithful</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; Therefore, for our salvation, he demands from us consent to him. For, he says, it is not harmed by our denial.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">These things he reminds you of</span><span class="c2 c0">. So that no one might think these things are unnecessary; concerning these words to Timothy, Paul says, &quot;These things he reminds you of,&quot; testifying before the Lord, and it is a fearful thing to speak before God as a witness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not to quarrel</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since the matter has a certain taste, and the human soul always wishes to dispute and argue, you, Paul says, protesting to them before God, do not engage in argument; instead, he says, command, taking God as a witness, so that they may know that if they despise you, God will judge them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">about words to no profit</span><span class="c2 c0">. For not only does it have no benefit to engage in disputes, arguments, and battles, but it also causes harm to the weaker among those who listen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">present yourself approved</span><span class="c2 c0">. As an example, blameless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">a worker who does not need to be ashamed</span><span class="c2 c0">. Much has been said about this shame. For it is likely that some who are perishing feel shame about the preaching, as the apostles suffer badly, and as Christ is preached with the cross, or at least because the preachers are humble, namely, Paul, a weaver of tents, and Peter, along with several others, were fishermen. The fact that he is not ashamed is because he has done nothing corrupt.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">rightly dividing the word of truth</span><span class="c2 c0">. Cut away like a knife the excess and false doctrines, which those perishing have added to the preaching, and lead straight through the Spirit.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 2:16-19</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Avoid profane and empty chatter; for they will increase in ungodliness, and their message will spread like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened; and they overturn the faith of some.

And, let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Avoid profane and empty chatter</span><span class="c2 c0">. If anything new in the preaching has been introduced from more recent empty chatter, it is altogether wicked and profane. As for that, either remove it or stand firmly to stop and prevent it altogether.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for they will increase in ungodliness</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if anything spurious is introduced, Paul says, it always leads to absurdity. And he receives a greater offering every day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">like gangrene</span><span class="c0">.

Rightly said above, for ungodliness will increase even more. For see how many evil things arise from saying that the resurrection has already happened. We would be deprived of the presence of Christ, what could be more grievous? There is no remedy, nor punishment. Christ, who promised these things, lies. And many similar things, such as, &quot;If there is no resurrection, then Christ has not been raised,&quot; (1 Cor. 15:14) nor does a judge sit over the living and the dead. (Acts 10:42)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and they overturn the faith of some</span><span class="c2 c0">. Of those who are simpler and weaker.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Yet the solid foundation</span><span class="c2 c0">. Indeed, the faith of the weak is subverted; &quot;a solid foundation&rdquo;, however, stands (referring to the faithful who cannot be overthrown), having this mark and sign: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">The Lord knows those who are His</span><span class="c2 c0">. Once indeed they were foreknown as wholly devoted to God and unchangeable. For the sign that they are known by God is that they could not be overthrown by wickedness so as to depart from the faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">depart from iniquity</span><span class="c2 c0">. Here is another indication: namely, let everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord depart from iniquity, that is, from the error of doctrines, as it is proper to call upon His name. For those who, like certain living columns, remain immovable, bear these inscriptions in their works.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 2:20-21</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">In a large house, there are not only golden and silver vessels, but also wooden and pottery, some of which are for honor, and others for dishonor. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Even now there are some who marvel at why the wicked are not destroyed. And we say that just as in a large house there are various vessels, so too in the world there are different kinds of people, not made so by God. For how could the wicked have the power to cleanse themselves? For this, going forward, commands those who lead themselves to this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and others for dishonor</span><span class="c2 c0">, such as wooden and pottery items.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself</span><span class="c0">. If the pottery vessel is something dishonorable and unclean, for Paul said, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">If anyone purifies himself</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; how then does he speak concerning the apostles, &quot;Having therefore this treasure in earthen vessels&quot;? (2 Cor. 4:7) And we say that there it discusses the nature of the body, not as something impure, but as something made of clay and earth. For from these the shell, the hard shell, is received there, as in relation to the comparison of the treasure contained within it. However, here it discusses virtue and wickedness, calling the wicked ones &quot;pottery&quot; and the virtuous ones &quot;golden.&quot; Such persons are able, by their own choice, to be changed, both toward the good and toward the bad.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">a vessel for honor</span><span class="c2 c0">. As for vessels made of gold and pottery in a house, the vessels always remain the same. But for such-shaped people, it is serious that the pottery becomes gold, and the gold through negligence becomes pottery. Therefore, if someone cleanses himself from these wooden and pottery-like people, as having nothing of their kind, he becomes useful to the Master, since those others are clearly useless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">prepared for every good work</span><span class="c2 c0">. Even if now is not the time or opportunity to do this, one must nevertheless be ready and prepared to endure persecutions, sufferings, and martyrdom.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">On divine teaching and a life pure and peaceful even toward adversaries.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 2:22-26</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Flee from youthful lust. But pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. Reject foolish and ignorant questions, knowing that they generate arguments. A servant of the Lord must not argue but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, correcting challengers with gentleness, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the Devil&rsquo;s snare, having been captured by him to do his will</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Youthful lust</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;is not only fornication alone, but also every improper desire, whether one lusts for power or for wealth; for these fantasies are foolish and unstable of mind. Indeed, even an old man becomes youthful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But pursue righteousness</span><span class="c2 c0">. Righteousness is defined as the true and loyal temperament toward those we love.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">love, and peace with those who call on the Lord</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, to those who trust alone, those who call upon the Lord without deception and deceit; to the peaceful, the unarmed, unite with them, pursue what has been said with them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">from a pure heart</span><span class="c2 c0">. For one can also call upon piousness with hypocrisy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">foolish and ignorant</span><span class="c0">. For there are also sound and learned questions, namely those concerning the sacred Scriptures. But why did he say, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">Reject,</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot; and not rather, &quot;Convince and refute it yourself&quot;? Because a good answer brings no benefit: for they generate arguments.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">A servant of the Lord must not argue</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the servants of Christ ought to be peaceful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but be gentle to all</span><span class="c2 c0">. If one ought to be gentle and mild, how did he say elsewhere: &quot;Rebuke them sharply,&quot; (Titus 1:13) and: &quot;Let not the youth be despised&quot;? (1 Tim. 4:12) Because it happens that one can rebuke sharply with mildness, and rashly and severely.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">able to teach</span><span class="c2 c0">, that is, to those who desire to learn. Furthermore, flee from a heretical man after one or two warnings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">patient</span><span class="c0">. For indeed, boldness is fierce, but gentleness knows how to persuade. For who would be persuaded by the bold one, who is often opposed even by the one advising? How then does Paul say elsewhere, after the first and second admonition, to avoid heretics? For see, having said this here as well, he designated the heretics as those challenging. And we say that those confessed and incurably ill must be avoided. But those concerning whom the matter was doubtful, and it is clear from what was said, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">that God may grant them repentance</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For the phrase &quot;may&quot; is a custom for us to speak about the uncertain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">correcting challengers with gentleness</span><span class="c2 c0">. For this is most necessary. For often he who has been given advice ten times and has not listened will obey another who gives advice once, clearly the first ten counselors are working against their own interest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that God may grant them repentance</span><span class="c2 c0">. And if it happens, Paul says, it is the work of God, not only of your gentleness. He suppresses the mindset of the teachers, leading the matter up to God.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and that they may come to their senses and escape the Devil&rsquo;s snare</span><span class="c2 c0">. But what is the knowledge of the truth? It is to recover from the Devil and from false doctrines, toward the truth of faith. See how, as from drunkenness or madness, Paul said they recover from the Devil&#39;s snare. For just as a little bird, even if caught by the tip of its foot, is still under the snare beneath it; so also we, even if we stray slightly from the doctrine, are caught under the Devil&#39;s snare.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">having been captured by him</span><span class="c2 c0">. Being revived while captured, that is, being seized and confined by error to the will of the Devil. For those who are led astray by evil doctrines, having been seized to the Devil&#39;s own will, are held by the Devil.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">___________________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Translator notes for 2 Timothy chapter 2.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">1.

Therefore, these types always exist, but especially in the last times.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">difficult times</span><span class="c2 c0">. It is not the times or the days that are to blame, but the wicked people living in them. For we call times good or bad based on what happens in them. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">lovers of themselves</span><span class="c2 c0">. This is the root of wickedness, to consider only oneself. And those who are such, neglecting their brothers, first destroy their own.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">arrogant</span><span class="c0">. From </span><span class="c0 c1">lovers of themselves</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are </span><span class="c0 c1">lovers of money</span><span class="c0">.

For they give thanks only when they have fulfilled their desire, but it never happens that they themselves are satisfied. But he who is such is also impious. For he who does not have gratitude towards God the Benefactor [&epsilon;&#8016;&epsilon;&rho;&gamma;&#941;&tau;&#8131;</span><span class="c0 c12">2</span><span class="c2 c0">], how will he show gratitude to others?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">without natural affection</span><span class="c2 c0">. Like those who are hostile towards their own.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">uncommitted</span><span class="c2 c0">. It shows that they have made no agreement with anyone. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">devilish</span><span class="c2 c0">. Like slanderers. For he who is conscious of no good in himself curses and slanders everyone, finding some comfort for himself in this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">without self-control</span><span class="c2 c0">. Namely those who do not control their tongue, stomach, and those things which are under the stomach.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">brutal</span><span class="c2 c0">. Some are harsh and cruel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">despisers of good</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, enemies of all things good.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">traitors</span><span class="c2 c0">. One who betrays friendship and companionship.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">reckless</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, rash and having nothing stable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">snobbish</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, full of arrogance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God</span><span class="c2 c0">. Exchanging the love of the divine for something shameful. Indeed, the very form of holiness exposes both hypocrites themselves and deceivers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">having a form of godliness</span><span class="c2 c0">. From those who speak, they seem to be cultivators of godliness: but from those who act, they are found and convicted to be contrary to their words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">And from these turn away</span><span class="c2 c0">. As for those, about whom Paul passed over without going into detail. But writing to Timothy, he advises those with Timothy to avoid such people. For he would not have come to the last days, but rather immediately after the death of Paul, in which Timothy was still to be involved.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 3:6-9</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For from these are those who enter into households and lead captive young women burdened with sins, who are driven by various lusts: always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Do you see that they have been deceived by the Serpent&#39;s deceit, which he used against Adam? For it was likely that he also deceived these men through the women. But by calling them mere women, he only revealed what is easily deceived. Therefore, the one being deceived, even if he is a man, differs in no way from a woman in this respect.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">But the multitude, accumulated with sins, also shows the confusion of sins. For it is not simply, Paul says, that women deceive (for there are also women of a courageous nature, just as there are men of a weak nature), but the sins accumulated, for from these come also the acts of deceit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who are driven by various lusts</span><span class="c0">. Paul did not blame nature, but such a woman. Here he encountered many lusts. Both bodily and mental. And see also the phrase &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">driven</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; as if towards irrational beings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">always learning</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not excusing them for these things, but rather strongly blaming them. For since they have heaped up sins for themselves, their mind has naturally become hardened because of them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Jannes and Jambres</span><span class="c2 c0">. These were the magicians of Pharaoh. But how does one know their names when Scripture does not say? We say that it was from unwritten tradition; it was likely from the Holy Spirit that Paul knew.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so do these also resist the truth</span><span class="c2 c0">. To the true faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith, but they will progress no further</span><span class="c0">. When someone&#39;s mind is corrupted by passions, then they become unreliable regarding faith. How could they advance in wickedness without saying &quot;they will advance&quot;? Here it says, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">they will progress no further</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; There it says that once they begin to wander, they will not stand anywhere, but will always devise something worse; here, however, it says that they will neither deceive nor seize many of the prudent. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS]</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">For Paul said beforehand, &quot;Wandering and being led astray.&quot; (2 Tim. 3:13) Therefore, the power lies with those who are not easily deceived.

Endurance towards persecutions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">such as happened to me</span><span class="c0">. Not only was I persecuted, Paul says, but I also suffered. Then, furthermore, he goes through the trials in detail, making the disciple bolder by this.

For by interpreting what worse is, Paul said that they themselves will be led into error and will get it wrong.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But you remain in the things you have learned</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Likewise said David, Do not envy the wicked, nor desire to be with those who do evil. (Ps. 24:1)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">you have learned</span><span class="c2 c0">, Paul says, that is, you learned with certainty.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">knowing from whom you have learned them</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul states two reasons why he must remain committed. And because you have not learned from just any common person, but from Paul; and because a deep root has been placed in you by the Scriptures, having been written a long time ago. However, he calls the Sacred Letters Scripture because they are inspired by God.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which are able to make you wise for salvation</span><span class="c2 c0">. He will not allow you to suffer anything foolish, like most do. For the one who knows the Scriptures, as one ought to know them, would never be put to shame.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus</span><span class="c0">. But it makes you wise, not according to the external wisdom that is in words and deceit, but to </span><span class="c0 c1">salvation through the faith in Christ</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the holy Scriptures, and the wisdom from them, lead to the faith of Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">All Scripture is God-breathed </span><span class="c0">[&theta;&epsilon;&#972;&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;]</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;and profitable</span><span class="c2 c0">. Having spoken many ways of comfort, Paul now speaks of the greatest, that which comes from the reading of the Scriptures. For he is about to say something sad, namely about his own death. But if Timothy must read, how much more must we?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for teaching</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since good things teach both lessons and actions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for criticism</span><span class="c2 c0">. Concerning the refutation of falsehoods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for correction</span><span class="c2 c0">. To correct the brothers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for training in righteousness</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the training and leading into righteousness. For from these things, Paul says, something perfect [&#7940;&rho;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&nu;] comes to be. A perfect person is one who is always equal, neither leaning downwards with a saddened spirit nor rising and swelling in prosperity, but always remains the same in unequal circumstances.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">equipped for every good work</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not merely participating but being equipped and complete.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">___________________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Translator notes for 2 Timothy chapter 3.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Long-standing Jewish tradition says that Jannes and Jambres were the two chief magicians who withstood Moses and Aaron in Exodus 7.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">2. &Epsilon;&#8016;&epsilon;&rho;&gamma;&#941;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, meaning &quot;the Benefactor&quot; (from &epsilon;&upsilon;-, &quot;good&quot;, + &epsilon;&rho;&gamma;&epsilon;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, &quot;doer, worker&quot;).</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c16">CHAPTER 4</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 4:1-2</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I therefore seriously charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, at his appearing and his kingdom: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage&mdash;with great patience and careful instruction</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The continuous exhortation and command produces three effects: it makes the command more formidable and undeniable, and it presents what is useful in speech. For if it were not such, it would not be necessary for it to be preached with such great determination. Moreover, what belongs to him who urgently announces it is done, no longer subject, as is likely, to the negligence that usually occurs in preaching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">who is to judge the living and the dead, at his appearing</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul speaks of the sinners and the righteous, or those who have passed away, and those still living, or that many will be left alive then. Paul also says elsewhere, &quot;Indeed, we shall not all sleep.&quot; (1 Cor. 15:51)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">at his appearing</span><span class="c2 c0">. When is the future to be judged? At the Lord&rsquo;s arrival, which will be after the kingdom and glory have come. For he will not come in the same way as he came before.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Preach the word</span><span class="c2 c0">. But what then is the obstacle? Do not hide the message, but proclaim it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">be prepared</span><span class="c0">. That is, repeat, look around and watch that no one sins. And do this promptly, untimely, that is, do not have a fixed and definite time for this, but at all times, even if it is not convenient, manage. And if you find, Paul says, someone sinning, </span><span class="c0 c1">correct</span><span class="c0">. For nothing ought to be done before you have convinced: and after you have shown him to be guilty, </span><span class="c0 c1">rebuke</span><span class="c2 c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Find fault, blame</span><span class="c0">. Then after the wound, apply a remedy. For Paul says, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">encourage</span><span class="c0">,&quot; so that such a person is not swallowed up by excessive grief. </span><span class="c2 c25">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">with great patience</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">For the matter requires patience, so that one should not simply trust those who speak, but come through every investigation and the test of time to the truth.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and careful instruction</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says to admonish along with the rebuke, as one lays it upon a child, not as one punishing an enemy, for he knows when encouragement has more power than rebuke.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">About those who were devising new things to oppose Timothy.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 4:3-5</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For there will be a time when they will not endure sound teaching; but according to their own desires they will accumulate for themselves teachers, having their ears tickled; and they will turn away their hearing from the truth and turn aside to myths. But you be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Therefore, before they rush headlong, occupy them in the meantime while they obey you. For this reason, Paul says &ldquo;in season and out of season,&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2) as long as they endure. For they must be accustomed to persuasion before they revolt. But observe the absurdity of the teachers, that the desires of the people serve as a pretext for them to protect themselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">having their ears tickled</span><span class="c0">.</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;That is, delighting in hearing things that excite desire, and always longing to hear things that please.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and they will turn away their hearing from the truth</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul foretells these things, not to cause sorrow, but teaching that it is necessary for the disciples, until they become obedient and reasonable, to be properly shaped and to be burdened, and so that when this comes to pass, they do not lose heart. &ldquo;For I was prepared,&quot; he says, &quot;and I was not disturbed.&quot; (Ps. 119:60) Do you see that they do not err as if unaware, but willingly? For they will turn away their hearing, he says, and be turned aside, so that the evil is voluntary.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But you be sober in all things</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, because of being sober and having been awakened, he said these things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">endure hardship</span><span class="c2 c0">. Strive, Paul says, labor, anticipate the teachings of the disciples in good and true doctrines before that distress comes upon you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">fulfill your ministry</span><span class="c2 c0">. For even Timothy also served in preaching. Indeed, he preached. Therefore, complete what you have begun with confidence, and spread the message while they are still receptive.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Concerning his own impending departure, into eternal glory.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 4:6-8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come; I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day&mdash;and not only to me, but also to all who love his appearance</span><span class="c2 c5">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For I, Paul says, already offer myself as a sacrifice to Christ. And he did not say sacrifice, but a </span><span class="c0 c1">drink offering</span><span class="c2 c0">, indicating something greater and more sacred. For a part of the sacrifice alone was offered to God as incense. But the entire drink offering was dedicated to Him. And Paul himself commands his disciples to do this, saying: &quot;Present your members as a living sacrifice.&quot; (Rom. 12:1) For he who sacrifices for Christ performs a sacred service himself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS]</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The meaning of &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">being am poured out</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot; is, as it were, that I break the war against all. Neither fighting nor being fought against, for I am perfected.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">of my departure</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">For departure means death, either because of the departing from the earth from which we were taken; or towards the Creator Christ. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius &Pi; f.169r; A f.182v; B f. 220v; G f.309v&mdash;310r</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">fought</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul said this, not boasting: by no means, but consoling the disciple, as if he were going to receive crowns and rewards for good works, and as if he said: You ought rather to rejoice than mourn, that I achieve such an end.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I have fought the good fight</span><span class="c0">. For every struggle on behalf of Christ is good, even if it involves chains, or persecutions, or deaths.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">If therefore it is good, then you should accept it yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I have finished the race</span><span class="c2 c0">. For Paul had run through the world, leading all to the knowledge of God, so that the Gospel had been fulfilled from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I have kept the faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. For many wished to seize it from him, false friends, enemies, Greeks, Jews, </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">From now there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Then Paul also comforts Timothy from his sufferings. For who would grieve over one receiving a crown? And of righteousness, as if it were the universal virtue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day</span><span class="c0">. For do not tell me here about temporary things, for I seek those there. But see how the obligation demands it from him, through the phrase, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">will award to me</span><span class="c0">,&quot; but he did not say, &quot;He will give&quot;; this is also indicated by, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">the righteous Judge</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not only to me</span><span class="c2 c0">. Here he also appointed Timothy, saying that he will repay you as well. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For if he gives a crown </span><span class="c0 c1">to all who love his appearance</span><span class="c2 c0">, much more to you. But who loves his appearance? Those who do good deeds and are rewarded by the good.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 4:8-13</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I urged you to come to me quickly. For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present age, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry. I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the books, especially the parchments</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">For what reason does Paul call Timothy to himself to whom the Church of Ephesus had been entrusted? Since Paul being in prison, he was not able to leave. Therefore, he wishes Timothy to come to him, both because he is alone, and because he had given him certain instructions. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">come to me quickly</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul did not say: Meanwhile, while I am still alive: for he did not want to sadden Timothy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">having loved this present age</span><span class="c2 c0">. Having become safe and secure, as he thought. For Demas preferred to indulge in luxury at home rather than suffer hardships with me. But Paul does not want to slander this man, rather to support us so that we do not become weak. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Crescens to Galatia</span><span class="c2 c0">. They had left of their own accord, therefore he does not say, &ldquo;The rest.&rdquo; Moreover, Titus was among the distinguished to whom the bishopric of Crete had been entrusted.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Only Luke is with me</span><span class="c2 c0">. This Luke is the one who wrote the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. And since he was eager to learn, holy and committed, he was never separated from Paul.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul said, &quot;Not for my comfort, but for the ministry of the Gospel.&quot; Indeed, Paul also called Timothy for this reason, so that after his death the brothers might be comforted.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for ministry</span><span class="c2 c0">. Of the Gospel, Paul says.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I have sent Tychicus</span><span class="c2 c0">. See the unity through all things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Bring the cloak that I left</span><span class="c2 c0">. Here Paul mentions a certain garment. However, he seeks to ensure that he is not a burden to anyone in need. For this is of the greatest concern to him everywhere.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [CHRYSOSTOM] In another way. Here the type of clothing is mentioned. Some indeed want it to signify a case in which little books were kept. But what necessity was there for the little books themselves, for one who was soon to depart to God? Certainly, then it was especially necessary to entrust them to the faithful, and for them to have those as their own teaching. Indeed, he was seeking a case so that he would not need to receive it from others. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Chrysostom</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [THEODORET] </span><span class="c0 c1">especially the parchments</span><span class="c0">. The term &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">parchments</span><span class="c0">,&quot; more commonly known in Roman usage as &ldquo;scrolls&quot; [&epsilon;&#7990;&lambda;&eta;&tau;&alpha;], was used moderately according to the custom in Rome, from which Paul was indeed writing the Epistle. &nbsp;For the ancient Scriptures were contained in scrolls, just as the Jews still mostly possess them up to the present day. </span><span class="c0 c1">[end of the excerpt by Theodoret</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He referred to </span><span class="c0 c1">books</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;[&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#943;&alpha;] in a general sense, so that Paul might also have books in another form or format.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">especially the parchments</span><span class="c2 c0">. Perhaps, however, these contained certain more useful things within themselves. Nevertheless, those worthy of laughter are those who think that the Apostle here meant a cloak rather than a type of booklet, who did not pay attention to the sequence of letters. For it would have been needless to say: &quot;And books,&quot; even if that had been a type of booklet, since it could have been indicated together with others. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10" id="h.szei1qquhagn"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 4:14-18</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our words. In my first defense, no one came to my support, but all deserted me (may it not be counted against them). But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the Gentiles might hear it. I was rescued from the lion&rsquo;s mouth, and the Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Paul also showed Timothy to endure bravely the troubles from common people. For it is painful to be wronged, especially by common people.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the Lord will repay him</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not because Paul was pleased with the punishment, but because for the sake of the weaker among the believers, those who were excessively opposing had to suffer badly, so that they would not despise the weakness of the preaching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">according to his deeds</span><span class="c2 c0">. Or that it is a prophecy of things to come, not a curse.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Beware of him yourself</span><span class="c0">. Paul did not say, Punish, punish (for it was also permitted for Timothy to do this through the spirit), but, </span><span class="c0 c1">Beware</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you see that he does not allow punishment? But the &quot;Beware&quot; is like a warning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">opposed our words</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, to those of the preaching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">In my first defense</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul already appeared before Nero and escaped. But when he instructed his cupbearer, then he was beheaded. For Nero did not have such zeal towards idols; he was thus relentless in all things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but all deserted me</span><span class="c2 c0">. The Jews, Paul says, the brothers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">may it not be counted against them</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you see that Paul not only does not wish to be avenged, but also prays for their forgiveness? And yet he suffered terrible things. For it is not the same to be betrayed by strangers as by one&#39;s own people.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But the Lord stood by me</span><span class="c0">. For the Lord does not abandon the one forsaken by men. He </span><span class="c0 c1">strengthened m</span><span class="c2 c0">e, Paul says; that is, the Lord granted boldness and did not allow me to fall. Do you see a counsel to the disciple, and again another comfort?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that through me the preaching</span><span class="c2 c0">. See the humility. For I was helped not as worthy of assistance, but because of the preaching, so that it might be fully accomplished and come to an end.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and all the Gentiles might hear it</span><span class="c2 c0">, Paul says. &quot;So that the power of the preaching and the care concerning me may become evident to all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">from the lion&rsquo;s mouth</span><span class="c2 c0">. It refers to the lion, that is Nero, because of his cruelty and beastliness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and the Lord will rescue me</span><span class="c2 c0">. If He will deliver, how does He say, &quot;I am already being poured out&quot;? But see. Then indeed the Lord delivered Paul from Nero, but now no longer from Nero, (for enough has happened according to the Gospel,) but from every sin, that is, the Lord will not allow one who has been condemned in anything to perish.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says, &quot;He will snatch me from there, and will keep me.&quot; For this means, &quot;He will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom.&quot; Therefore, this is the true salvation, when we shine there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen</span><span class="c2 c0">. See the doxology for the Son as well as for the Father elsewhere, and for the Spirit; here indeed is the Lord, namely the Son.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">2 Timothy 4:19-22</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Priscilla and Aquila greet you, and the household of Onesiphorus. Erastus stayed in Corinth. I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus greet you, as does Claudia, and all the brothers. The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with us all. Amen</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">These are the ones whom Paul continually remembers among the tentmakers, from among whom he also stayed with and often mention. But he first remembers the woman, as more trustworthy and earnest. For she also instructed Apollo. He offers a greeting, both comforting at the same time, and also showing honor and love through this, and the greater things, having been filled with much grace, the one being addressed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and the household of Onesiphorus</span><span class="c2 c0">. For Onesiphorus was in Rome. Therefore, Paul greets those in his house, stirring up zeal similar to that of Onesiphorus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Erastus stayed in Corinth</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since Paul did not remember these things before, now he remembers, in order to show that he is isolated on all sides and needs Timothy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I left Trophimus sick in Miletus</span><span class="c2 c0">. Miletus is near Ephesus. Therefore, when he sailed to Judea, Paul left him in Miletus, or after arriving in Rome, again in these parts, we do not have information to say.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">sick</span><span class="c2 c0">. Why then did he not heal him, but let him be? Because the saints did not do everything, so that they would not be considered better than human nature.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Make every effort to come before winter</span><span class="c2 c0">. &quot;Until then,&quot; Paul says, &quot;while I live, so that you do not see me having been delayed by the winter.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and Linus</span><span class="c2 c0">. They say that this Linus became the second bishop of Rome after Peter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">as does Claudia</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you see how even women have been fierce and passionate, crucified to the world? Indeed, this kind is in no way inferior to men, provided they desire it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and all the brothers</span><span class="c2 c0">. Those mentioned by name were more fervent in faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit</span><span class="c2 c0">. The help is twofold, that of Christ and that of the Holy Spirit, as if Paul were saying, With the coming of the Holy Spirit which you now have. Let also the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Since this is with you, you will not suffer at my departure. Or that it is not possible to enjoy the presence of Christ without being endowed with spiritual grace, so as to be, in relation to this interpretation, with your spirit, that is, with spiritual grace.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Grace be with us</span><span class="c2 c0">.

For he spent the winter there. The purpose of this letter is this: He left Titus in Crete to appoint clergy in the cities. Since many there were attempting to deceive the people under the pretext of the law, Paul, having learned this, writes.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">And first, giving thanks to God for His reverence, it signifies that the faith in Christ is not new, but has been prepared and promised by God from eternity. Then concerning the state of the clergy, and it teaches how and what kind of minster they ought to be.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">And he is commanded to rebuke those who contradict the sound doctrine, especially those of the circumcision, knowing that the Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons, and to teach that all food is clean to the clean, and how the older women who owe this duty must train the younger women in self-control. He also exhorts how slaves ought to be subject to their own masters.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">And finally, having reminded that the grace of the Spirit did not justify us by works, but by His own kindness; and having commanded to avoid legal disputes as shameless, Paul shows that after sending Artemas to Titus, so that he might come to him, he also instructed him to teach and to take the lead in good works among his own, and thus Paul completes the Epistle.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">THEODORET</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Titus was an excellent disciple of Paul. Indeed, he was appointed by Paul to be the bishop of Crete, which was very large. Moreover, he was authorized and entrusted to ordain bishops in the lower ranks. When Paul wrote these things, he was in freedom: for he nowhere mentions affliction. The letter is also extended to the Jews. However, this letter seems to have been earlier than the letter to Timothy.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">The Epistle to Titus by the Apostle Paul</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c16">CHAPTER 1</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Preface.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 1:1-4</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God&#39;s elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness, in the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the beginning of time, but has now been revealed in his times his message through his preaching, which was entrusted to me, according to the command of our Savior God, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel, to Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Paul places no distinction here; elsewhere indeed a servant of Christ, but an apostle of God, now truly in a different manner.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">according to the faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. Because of faith, that is, because the chosen vessels of God have entrusted themselves to me, I have been made an apostle to teach them. Or in this way: I am an apostle to bring the elect to faith through me, and to know the truth of godliness, Christ. Or thus: To become an apostle and for the elect to be believed was not simply given to me, but because I came to know the truth of godliness. But what is this truth? Christ. Well then, the truth concerning godliness, just as with any other truth, is not about godliness as if it were a skill to be learned.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in hope of eternal life</span><span class="c0">. Indeed, to know the truth itself for its own sake is a great reward beyond thousands, but now the generous God also gives, besides this very reward, </span><span class="c0 c1">eternal life</span><span class="c0">. For it is said to be for </span><span class="c0 c1">the knowledge of the truth</span><span class="c2 c0">, of the life that is based on hope, eternal. And the term &quot;eternal,&quot; making a comparison to the Jews: for they had the promise of present life. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which God, who never lies</span><span class="c2 c0">. If God is without deceit, He will certainly fulfill what He has promised.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">promised before the beginning of time</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not by a later decree or repentance, Paul says, did God determine this, but from the beginning. The greatest honor is that we were loved from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but has now been revealed</span><span class="c0">. What did God reveal in his own times and appropriate seasons? The life which he had promised from eternity. For his Word, that is, Christ, is life and the giver of life. Therefore, when Paul said that God had promised life, he immediately added, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">revealed in his times his message through his preaching</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot;: but through his preaching, as if the Word itself, that is, Christ, is the author and giver of that life. Through preaching indeed, that is, openly and plainly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">which was entrusted to me</span><span class="c2 c0">. From what Paul says: It has been entrusted to me, and, according to the command, he signified that it must necessarily be done and, without making any excuse, whether willing or unwilling, to preach. This also you, he said, do, O Titus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to Titus, my true child</span><span class="c2 c0">. For one is a child because they have been baptized by them, but not legitimately, because they are sinful. The reason for you being my child, Paul says, is shared faith. He praises Titus as having nothing more than faith in him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Another way. Titus, the child of Paul, as he was taught faith by him, and according to </span><span class="c0 c1">common faith</span><span class="c2 c0">, that is, from baptism, is a brother of Paul. For there is one Father, Christ, and one mother, the baptismal font.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Grace, mercy</span><span class="c0">. It is fitting that grace and mercy be prayed for Titus, who is a teacher. For if you do not govern the people, that is, with </span><span class="c0 c1">grace, mercy, and peace</span><span class="c2 c0">, Paul says, the ship of the Church will be overturned.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">On the training of teachers for ministry and the rebuke of the disobedient.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 1:5-6</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might put in order what was left unfinished, and appoint elders in every city as I directed you. If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children who are not accused of overindulgence or insubordination</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You see them as distributing the inhabited world like one house, and each doing something; but look at the athlete of Christ. Where there was danger, Paul himself was present; but when some honor was about to come, he sent the disciples. For Paul had left Titus to appoint bishops in each city, since he had first made him a bishop. And see, he is not ashamed to write to the disciple, saying, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">put in order what was left unfinished</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; For Paul was looking to this one thing alone, namely the salvation of all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">elders in every city</span><span class="c2 c0">. For Paul did not wish the entire island of Crete, which was large, to be governed by one bishop, but each city to have its own shepherd. And he calls the bishops elders.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">If anyone is blameless</span><span class="c2 c0">. Let his life be pure, it is said, and let no one have occasion to find fault with his life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the husband of one wife</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says that she alone should know the lawful one. He silences heretics who detest marriage, as if they could also take care of anything after marriage. But he forbids the second marriage, as being under condemnation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">having faithful children</span><span class="c2 c0">. For he who has not disciplined his own children, how can he manage others?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 1:7-8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For the bishop must be blameless as God&#39;s steward, not stubborn, not quick-tempered, not drunken, not violent, not greedy for gain; but hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, righteous, holy, disciplined, holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he may be able both to encourage with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">To be accused is a general concept. For to be accused encompasses all things that are to be named: that is, one against whom no crime can be charged.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">as God&#39;s steward</span><span class="c2 c0">. Since, Paul says, the office is great, it also requires great watchfulness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not quick-tempered</span><span class="c2 c0">. For he who cannot master himself, how will he be able to beneficially lead others?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not drunken. </span><span class="c2 c0">Drunkard, overbearing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not violent</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not one who harms the consciences of brothers. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not greedy for gain</span><span class="c2 c0">. As one who is poor is usually like: as if any profit, even if it seems just, is disgraceful for a bishop.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">holy</span><span class="c2 c0">. Pure from passions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">disciplined</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not only regarding food alone, but also all passions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">holding firmly to the trustworthy message</span><span class="c2 c0">. &nbsp;Or of the true, or of that which is granted through faith, and not from reasoning. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Therefore Paul said, </span><span class="c0 c1">as it has been taught</span><span class="c2 c0">, meaning that one can teach even without external wisdom. For, he says, there is no need for natural or philosophical evidence, but rather for doctrine and usefulness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">be able both to encourage with sound doctrine</span><span class="c2 c0">. This will be from both understanding and knowledge of the Scriptures. Teaching that is healthy is that which teaches true doctrines and a righteous life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and to refute those who contradict it</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the one who does not know how to fight against enemies, and to capture every thought into the obedience of Christ, will do none of the necessary things.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Against those who advocate for bodily purifications, and in favor of spiritual virtue.</span></p><p class="c3 c10" id="h.enlheo5tm5rm"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 1:10-11</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially those from the circumcision. They must be silenced, who overturn whole households, teaching things they ought not for dishonest gain</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Paul said the root of all things, from which the rest also grow. For the disobedient person does not want to yield themselves, but desires to rule and oversee others. Then it is necessary that he who rules with ecclesiastical authority also teaches, but he who teaches before he has learned, because he does not obey others, is rightly found to be a babbler and a deceiver of minds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">especially those from the circumcision</span><span class="c2 c0">. For even Christ reproached them for seeking power: who, even after receiving faith, did not abandon this disease.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">They must be silenced</span><span class="c0">. For if a bishop has the care and leadership entrusted to him of others, and does not know how to silence the mouths of babblers and seducers, and to convict them, he becomes the cause of loss for those who perish. And rightly it is said: </span><span class="c0 c1">must be silenced</span><span class="c2 c0">: that is, by the force of rebukes, they should not even be allowed to speak, so that from this there may also be found listeners. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">teaching things they ought not for dishonest gain</span><span class="c2 c0">. There is nothing that this passion does not urge to transgress.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 1:12-14</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">One of them, a prophet of their own, said: &quot;Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.&quot; This testimony is true. For this reason, he rebuked them sharply, so that they might be sound in the faith, not paying attention to Jewish fables and human commandments that turn away from the truth</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is asked for what reason Paul brought forward the testimony of the Greeks, and commended it, especially since it was not rightly said? But what is the testimony? The Cretans built a tomb for Zeus. And so a certain poet</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;says: The Cretans built a tomb for you, O king; but you are by no means dead, for you always live. Part of this prophecy is: The Cretans are always liars, etc. However, the Apostle attested that this saying is true. But if this testimony is true, then Zeus must be immortal. Yet we say that in this alone he said the testimony was true, because he called them liars themselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] Epimenides the Cretan, the oracle of the prophet. Callimachus has also made use of the verse spoken by him in the hymn to Zeus. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius G f. 314r</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Where Paul says: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c1">This testimony</span><span class="c2 c0">,&rdquo; namely that he says they themselves are liars. Indeed, someone might say this is so: but why did he bring forth testimony from the Greeks? And we say that this affected them with the greatest shame that it produced testimony of their own wickedness from their own people. For since those among us do not have faith in them, Paul brought their own accusers to them. This God was also doing when, through the star, He indicated Christ to the Magi, so that they would be occupied with astronomy (Matt. 2), as if admonishing them by their own. Again, the prophet from the oxen drawing the ark (2 Sam. 6:3). Moreover, Saul from the woman having the spirit of Python (Acts 16:16), because he believed her. In these ways God was revealing Himself. Nor is it opposed by the fact that Christ and afterwards the apostles forbade demons to speak: for signs were made which could persuade (Mark 9:38). It was necessary that they persuade men by those whom they believed. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">For this reason, he rebuked them sharply</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, because some are wicked, he says, rebuke them more harshly, for they could not be led from gentleness to what is right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">be sound in the faith</span><span class="c2 c0">. To be sound in faith, however, is if one has introduced nothing external to it, neither Jewish nor Gentile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Jewish fables</span><span class="c2 c0">. The Jewish stories are called fables for two reasons: both because their time has passed, and because even when they were in force, they were a resemblance of truth and not the truth itself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and human commandments</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul speaks about the observations concerning food, which is evident from what follows.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">___________________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Translator notes for Titus chapter 1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">1. Epimenides is regarded the author of the well-known verse &ldquo;Cretans are ever liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.&rdquo; It appeared for the first time, in Callimachus&#39; Hymn to Zeus, and later, in the Christian era, Paul the Apostle mentioned it in his epistle to Titus.</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">his verse has become controversial because of questions relating to its origin and/or its context, and because of the relation between its supposed author and the bad reputation of the Cretans ... his reputation of the Cretans seems to have been created out of caprice by ancient non-Cretans who sought for various reasons to vilify the inhabitants of Minos&#39; island. An historian of Crete illustrates the case: Callimachus of Cyrene called the Cretans liars because they presented Zeus as mortal. To the Athenians they were liars for claiming the birth of the gods on the island of Crete. The Romans and the Romanizing Greek writers remained hostile towards the Cretans due to the latter&#39;s resistance to Roman imperialism. Regarding Paul the Apostle, he was referring only to the Jews of Crete in his epistle to Titus.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c16">CHAPTER 2</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 1:15-16; 2:1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Things are always pure to the pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled. They confess to know God, but by their works they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient, and unfit for every good work. But you speak what accords with sound doctrine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] What then was the law given to the Jews concerning uncleanness? And we say, not because they were unclean did God legislate accordingly, but by this law cutting off much luxury and indifference among the Jews. For what is clean and unclean depends chiefly on the character of those receiving it. Since by nature all things are clean to those who do not examine too closely; but to those who are not such, all things are unclean, though not actually unclean. For only sin is truly unclean. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 185v; B f. 224v; G f. 314v</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but to the defiled</span><span class="c2 c0">. Therefore, impure things come from a defiled mind: just as for a person suffering from an illness, all things are unpleasant because of the disease.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but both their mind and conscience are defiled</span><span class="c2 c0">. No food is indeed impure, Paul says, but the mind and conscience of those people are impure, and their skepticism makes foods impure and useless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">They confess to know God</span><span class="c2 c0">. This is truly impure, for faith without works is dead. (James 2:26)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But you speak what accords with sound doctrine</span><span class="c2 c0">. But although these men are such, Paul said, you should nevertheless not become any less diligent, but do what is your duty and teach, even if no one obeys.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Exhortations which ought to be given to each according to their age.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 2:2-5</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Elders must be sober, honorable, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in patience; likewise, older women must be respectful in behavior, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good, so that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be self-controlled, pure, homemakers, kind, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be reviled.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Elders must be sober</span><span class="c2 c0">. For old age is mostly followed by slowness and sluggishness. This, therefore, corrects it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[&epsilon;&#7990;&nu;&alpha;&iota;].</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">For the common expression is, &ldquo;must be&rdquo; [&epsilon;&#7990;&nu;&alpha;&iota; &delta;&epsilon;&#8150;].</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">self-controlled</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;[&sigma;&omega;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#973;&nu;&eta;]. He basically says careful [&Phi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&#943;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;]. For self-controlled is, as it were, soundness, the salvation of the mind. For self-control would not have been sought after by the aged in matters of immorality, as this is generally acknowledged.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">patience</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul rightly says that they ought to have patience. For irritability clings to old age.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] </span><span class="c0 c1">likewise, older women</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul refers to the deaconesses. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Respectful. </span><span class="c0">From this Paul means clothing.

From this attire, Paul says, they showed modesty and the fact of engaging in sacred services.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not slanderers</span><span class="c2 c0">. For from wine follows slander: and especially because the violence that comes of wine is hostile to weaker old age.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">teachers of what is good</span><span class="c0">. And how does it hinder women from teaching elsewhere? And we say that here it speaks about an exhortative speech addressed to household members, but there it is about sitting in public and speaking in the assembly.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">And that it has made them participants only of the teaching which is imparted at home is made clear by what follows.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that they may train the young women</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul is not speaking only about their daughters but of women in general, and for the younger to be subordinate to the older.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to love their husbands</span><span class="c2 c0">. This is the head of all duties that exist in the family, from which the rest arise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to love their children</span><span class="c2 c0">. For she who loves the root will also love the branches.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">homemakers</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says &ldquo;homemaker&rdquo;, those who manage the household affairs. However, such guardians are concerned neither with their own nourishment nor with untimely departures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that the word of God may not be reviled</span><span class="c2 c0">. For if a husband were unfaithful, having a faithful wife, but not submissive and corrupt, the very faith would be slandered which such women have. Do you see that Paul writes this, having especially the care of preaching?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 2:6-8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">He also urged the younger men to be sensible; presenting yourself as a pattern of good works in everything, in teaching, showing incorruptibility, dignity, sound speech, and blamelessness; so that the opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Do you see how appropriately Paul arranged it, appointing women as teachers of women and elderly women, and Titus himself to the men?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to be sensible</span><span class="c0">. For nothing is so hostile to youth as the erotic love</span><span class="c0 c12">1</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;[&#7956;&rho;&omega;&sigmaf;] of the body.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">presenting yourself as a pattern of good works</span><span class="c2 c0">. Let it be, Paul says, that your life is a common teaching and example to all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in teaching</span><span class="c2 c0">. Providing common understanding. Therefore, offering integrity, familiarity, and a certain humility in teaching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">showing incorruptibility</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, community and something like straightforwardness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">dignity</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, not as a ruler, nor as one speaking to subjects, but gently as to children. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">sound speech</span><span class="c2 c0">. Clearly, that of the doctrines. For when these are added to the teaching, he who opposes, whether the slanderer or the heretic, will be ashamed, finding no hold at all against us.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Concerning slaves, so that they themselves may also serve worthily of the grace of Christ.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 2:9-10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Slaves, be obedient to your own masters with all respect, to please them in everything, not being argumentative or pilfering, but showing all good faith:, so that in everything they may adorn the teaching of our Savior God</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Therefore, it is not proper to take slaves away from their masters under the pretext of virtue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">not being argumentative</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul urges the observance of obedience and loyalty; for this is what most befits slaves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">they may adorn the teaching of our Savior</span><span class="c2 c0">. Rightly Paul said elsewhere, &quot;As servants of God, not of men.&quot; (1 Corinthians 7:23 and Ephesians 6:6-7) Indeed, although you serve the master with goodwill, he says, the opportunity nevertheless begins with the fear of God. For if they are wicked, they bring insult to Christianity. &ldquo;For the name of God is blasphemed because of you,&quot; (Isa. 52:5; Rom. 2:24) But those who do the things that have been said will fulfill the preaching, faithfully serving.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Titus 2:11-14</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a peculiar people for his own possession, eager to do good works</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Then Paul also gives a reason why slaves ought to be such toward their masters. For he says that the grace of God has appeared, educating us. Therefore, since we have become pupils of God&rsquo;s discipline, how could we not owe it to act in a manner worthy of His teaching?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">training us to renounce</span><span class="c2 c0">. The appearance of our Savior God, that is, the revealing in the flesh, not only freed from former sins, but also made us safer for the future. For, as it says, denying signifies great abstinence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">ungodliness and worldly passions</span><span class="c0">. Paul speaks of ungodliness as the doctrines of the wicked, and of worldly desires as those both of the soul and of the flesh, and all those that simply do not lead us to heaven. And the term &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">self-controlled</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot; does not only signify abstinence from bodily pleasures and their love, but also from every passion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in the present age</span><span class="c2 c0">. For this age has the struggle, but the age that is to come has the rewards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">waiting for the blessed hope</span><span class="c2 c0">. Behold also the rewards. For nothing is truly more blessed than His revealing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">of the glory</span><span class="c2 c0">. For the second coming of Jesus will be with glory, unlike the first which was in humility.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">of our great God</span><span class="c2 c0">. Where now are the inventors of impious doctrines, who assert that Christ is not God, or is lesser than the Father? For in this place the Apostle openly professes that Christ is even the great God. Truly great, he does not distinguish against some lesser god: by no means! but absolutely so great that no one greater can be understood by it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">a peculiar people</span><span class="c2 c0">. This is, different from others, abundantly beloved, having nothing in common with the remaining peoples.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">eager to do good works</span><span class="c0">. Do you see that even in our needs? </span><span class="c0 c1">Eager</span><span class="c2 c0">, Paul says, that is, going towards virtue with much excitement. For it was solely out of his own kindness that he freed us from the sins of old. And he accomplished virtue both for himself and for us.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">___________________</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Translator notes for Titus chapter 2.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">1. erotic love [&#7956;&rho;&omega;&sigmaf;].

Genealogies or concerning the Greeks, who were recounting the lineage of their gods. They say, &lsquo;such a one begot such a one&rsquo;. Concerning the Jews, who do not assert anything, but resort to genealogies and from them hold great esteem. Abraham, they say, Isaac and Jacob are our ancestors. But they bring foolish things, that is, nothing beneficial. For what benefit is there to a sinner if Abraham is his father? Indeed, rather it will bring harm if, having come from these, they were made reprobate. Flee, and beware. How then does Paul elsewhere command that he should stop the mouths of those who contradict, if it is absolutely necessary to believe and to forsake? And we say: That it is necessary to stop the mouths of those who teach to the destruction of others: but when they contend against you not about dogma, yield and forsake. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for they are unprofitable</span><span class="c2 c0">.

Why indeed, having established Titus in Crete, does Paul call him back to himself again? In order that he may be better structured and may advise on what is to be done.

Therefore, Paul writes to Philemon about this, praising Onesimus, so that he may receive him sincerely, and no longer have him as a slave, but as a brother. He also urged him to prepare a welcome for him, so that if he comes, he may find a place to stay. And thus, he completes the letter. It is noteworthy that this Onesimus was also deemed worthy of martyrdom in the city of Rome, at that time under the authority of Tertullus the governor, having endured the breaking of his legs as to undergo martyrdom.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">THEODORET</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Philemon was a remarkable man, a Phrygian by birth, and his city was Colossae; he was faithful in character and shared in the needs of the saints. Onesimus, a slave of Philemon, ran away, having stolen from him. Onesimus, coming to Rome to Paul, was instructed by him and, having been baptized, became remarkable even while Paul was in chains. Paul sends him back to Philemon, having made this letter a recommendation for Onesimus. Some say that this letter should not be counted among the other epistles because it concerns a trivial matter. But see how many useful things come from it! First, it teaches us to be earnest even about trivial matters. Second, that if a slave has returned so boldly, those who are free should not despise them. Third, that it is not fitting, under the pretense of holiness, to separate slaves against the will of their masters. Fourth, that we should not be ashamed of virtuous slaves, especially when Paul calls Onesimus his child. How then could such a letter, containing so much benefit, not be counted among the others? </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c9">The Epistle to Philemon by the Apostle Paul</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Philemon 1-3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c24 c5 c1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker, and to Apphia our beloved, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Paul, a prisoner</span><span class="c2 c0">. Immediately from the opening words he instructs the master not to shame the servant. For all things, even chains, are good for Christ. And that it is right for grace to be given to the prisoner for Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and Timothy our brother</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul includes Timothy as a partner in the supplication.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to Philemon our beloved</span><span class="c2 c0">. If beloved, he will grant favor; if a coworker, Paul will not put the servant to shame in the service of the preaching. Onesimus, having been given, will also fulfill the work of the master Philemon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and to Apphia our beloved, and Archippus</span><span class="c0">. Perhaps Apphia was the wife of Philemon, and Archippus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">But see the humility, for it also urges these to join in the supplication.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">our fellow soldier</span><span class="c2 c0">. If a fellow soldier, Paul also struggles in this. This is the one about whom he writes to the Colossians: Tell Archippus, &quot;Take heed to the ministry which you have received.&quot; (Co. 4:17)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">and to the church in your house</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul invites the whole household, and slaves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Grace to you</span><span class="c2 c0">. How then will the grace of God be with you? If you also forgive those who owe you. How then is peace? If you are reconciled to the servant.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">The praise of Philemon and a thanksgiving on his behalf.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Philemon 4-9</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I always thank my God, making mention of you in my prayers, hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints; that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. Therefore, having great boldness in Christ, I am commanding you what is proper, because of love, I urge you, being such as Paul the aged, but now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If ever </span><span class="c0 c1">I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;make </span><span class="c0 c1">mention of you</span><span class="c0">, I always do, </span><span class="c0 c1">I give thanks to God</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for you. Why? </span><span class="c0 c1">Hearing of your love and faith</span><span class="c0">, he says. Do you see that Paul does not immediately seek favor from the beginning?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">hearing of your love</span><span class="c2 c0">. which, if it were not great, would by no means be heard from Phrygia all the way to Rome.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that the fellowship of your faith</span><span class="c0">. It unites him to himself, just as if he said: Fellowship of faith is that which makes one and common. But why do you give thanks to God? So </span><span class="c0 c1">that the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">fellowship of your faith</span><span class="c0">, Paul says, </span><span class="c0 c1">may become effective</span><span class="c0">. But how will it be effective? If it proceeds to every work of virtue. Blessed Paul interprets himself. But how will it be </span><span class="c0 c1">effective</span><span class="c0">? By this, that you have </span><span class="c0 c1">the knowledge</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and accomplish </span><span class="c0 c1">every good thing</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">that is in us</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paule says that which is now also in us. (Matt. 25:40)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for Christ Jesus</span><span class="c2 c0">. For whoever does good to someone, does it to Christ, especially to the saints.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">we have great joy</span><span class="c2 c0">. Not only, Paul says, did we rejoice, but such was the pleasure that it even brought us comfort while in bonds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">because the hearts of the saints</span><span class="c2 c0">. Consider that when Paul wishes to say: &lsquo;If you show kindness to others, much more so show it to me&rsquo;, he does not say it exactly like that, but in a somewhat more fitting manner. For he knows that the memory of favors shown to others makes those whom we urged more inclined to help us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">have been refreshed through you</span><span class="c2 c0">. For, Paul says, they find rest in your love. They rest because of you. Since you are such toward the saints that you even strengthen them, I have confidence in commanding you: since I have confidence because of Christ in commanding you something that is beneficial; for this is what &lsquo;to command&rsquo; [&#7952;&pi;&iota;&tau;&#940;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;] signifies. However, I said &#39;to command&#39; not because I dominate you, but because of the love by which I both love you and am loved by you; indeed, I seem to command, but I do not command. For if I seem to command out of love, I do not command, but rather I ask: thus, he says, I magnify the matter.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Paul</span><span class="c2 c0">. And this alone is sufficient to persuade, </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">the aged, but now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ</span><span class="c2 c0">. Do you see the motives for persuading?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Recommendation of Onesimus, a runaway servant, and an appeal on his behalf, who has been saved through faith.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Philemon 10-14</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I therefore appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my chains, formerly useless to you, but now indeed useful both to you and to me, whom I have sent back. I appeal to you to receive him as my very heart: whom I wished to keep with me, so that he might serve me in the chains of the gospel on your behalf; but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed would not be forced but voluntary</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Paul mentions Philemon first, praising the servant as a beloved child, because he says he also baptized him. For this is the one, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">I have begotten while in my chains</span><span class="c0">.&quot; Therefore, having calmed Philemon&rsquo;s anger through these things, he thus gives the name </span><span class="c0 c1">Onesimus</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">formerly useless to you</span><span class="c2 c0">. For Paul knows that the acknowledged sin is to extinguish the master&#39;s anger.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">but now indeed useful both to you and to me</span><span class="c2 c0">. If such faithfulness is useful to Paul, who demands so much, it is clearly also useful to Philemon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">whom I have sent back</span><span class="c2 c0">. To hand Onesimus over to the master, rather extinguished his anger. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to receive him as my very heart</span><span class="c0">. What do I mean by &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">receive him</span><span class="c0">&quot;? Receiving this one, you will receive my own very </span><span class="c0 c1">heart</span><span class="c0">. Thus he says, I love him as one calls him his own </span><span class="c0 c1">heart</span><span class="c0">. And &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">receive</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot; means to accept with love.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that he might serve me in the chains of the gospel on your behalf</span><span class="c0">. Do you see that Paul has brought the master to the very place, little by little? For he says that </span><span class="c0 c1">he serves me on your behalf</span><span class="c2 c0">. Here he shows that he wishes what is more advantageous for the master. For if you say that you ought to serve, and he does this instead of you, the benefit is yours.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">in the chains of the gospel</span><span class="c2 c0">. In chains for the sake of the Gospel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">without your consent</span><span class="c2 c0">. This especially softened the matter itself, because Paul did not do something so necessary for himself without his consent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that your good deed would not be forced but voluntary</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul did not say, &quot;By force,&quot; but, &quot;would not be forced;&quot; as if he had said, &quot;I knew that even against your will, forcing Onesimus on you, I would not cause you pain. But so that it may not seem to be done by force, I was not willing,&quot; he says. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Philemon 15-20</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">For I suppose that for this reason he was separated for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would me. And if he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge that to me. I, Paul, write this with my own hand&mdash;I will repay it&mdash;to avoid saying to you that you owe me your own self as well. Yes, brother. May I enjoy refreshment in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Since Onesimus has changed his mind from being a wicked one, he himself turns it to the doubtful, as if Paul said: For perhaps he fled for reasons of caution.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for this reason he was separated</span><span class="c2 c0">. With a euphemistic name, Paul called it separation, so that the memory of the separation would not provoke the master. Then he also limits the time, calming the anger, or he speaks in terms of a season of the year.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">so that you might have him back forever</span><span class="c2 c0">, you have, that is, you receive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">But more than a slave</span><span class="c0">. Do you see that escaping brought many benefits? For instead of an hour of escape, you have an eternal one. (For the escape is but one hour compared to eternity.) And instead of a worthless slave, you have received </span><span class="c0 c1">a beloved brother</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">how much more to you</span><span class="c0">. If to me, much more to you, even in worldly services. For this is &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">in the flesh</span><span class="c0">.&quot; And in spiritual matters. For this is &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">in the Lord</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">So if you consider me a partner</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, if you think and wish the same things as I do.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">welcome him as you would me</span><span class="c2 c0">. Wow, how great is the magnitude of those words!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">And if he has wronged you</span><span class="c0">. Paul did not say, &quot;He stole,&quot; but the verb is cut short. He says he </span><span class="c0 c1">wronged</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">or owes</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">charge that to me</span><span class="c0">. For it was likely that they themselves had consumed together the things that had been stolen, and Paul says, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">charge this to me</span><span class="c2 c0">,&quot; that is, charge these things as a debt to me, let the obligation be held against me. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I, Paul, write</span><span class="c2 c0">. He wrote with spiritual grace, as if he said, But for safe keeping, that I will repay the debt, I have made the letters with my own hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">to avoid saying to you that you owe me your own self as well</span><span class="c2 c0">. So that Paul may not seem to insult Philemon by not daring to appeal to him openly on behalf of the runaway slave (for this would show Philemon to be somewhat harsh), it shows that Paul is also very confident in Philemon. For he says not only your own things, but also yourself you owe to me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Yes, brother</span><span class="c0">. Again, from what is pleasing it advances to what is serious. &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">Yes</span><span class="c0">,&quot; he said, &quot;</span><span class="c0 c1">brother</span><span class="c2 c0">.&quot; What? Accept it yourself. I will take advantage from you in things that are according to Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">May I enjoy</span><span class="c2 c0">. That is, I delight in your excellent works in the Lord. May I see you growing rich in all spiritual blessings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">refresh my heart</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul says, Refresh my love for you for the sake of Christ.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c8 c5">Philemon 21-25</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">I wrote to you, confident in your obedience, knowing that you will also do more than I say. At the same time, prepare a lodging for me; for I hope that through your prayers I will be granted the opportunity to come to you. Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings, as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen</span><span class="c2 c5">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">confident</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul said, &quot;You do this not for me, but for Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">confident in your obedience</span><span class="c0">. I did not write to you as one commanding or stubbornly dealing with you, but having confidence </span><span class="c0 c1">in your obedience</span><span class="c2 c0">. Whom would these things not soften, even if he were made of iron?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">knowing that you will also do more than I say</span><span class="c2 c0">. Paul said this, persuading Philemon in every way to accept Onesimus, if not for any other reason, then at least so as not to destroy his own reputation if he had any with the Apostle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">prepare a lodging for me</span><span class="c0">. Paul says that he did not write only because of Onesimus (for Philemon would have said, if not for himself, that I was not worthy of even a word), but also for this reason, Paul says, that you might </span><span class="c0 c1">prepare a lodging for me</span><span class="c2 c0">. And Philemon was even afraid that if he did not receive Onesimus, the Apostle would come and it would be known that he had been disobedient.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">for I hope that through your prayers</span><span class="c2 c0">. Great indeed is the power of prayers, and great also is the humility of Paul, because he was in need of those prayers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner</span><span class="c2 c0">. This man was sent from the Colossians to Paul, as it is clear that Philemon was from Colossae. Epaphras is called a fellow prisoner, indicating that he too was in great distress. Moreover, this also honors him; for Epaphras was indeed a fellow prisoner, whereas this one did not even show kindness to Onesimus, who was a prisoner for the Lord. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Aristarchus, Demas</span><span class="c2 c0">. About this, Paul wrote to Timothy, &ldquo;Demas abandoned me.&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:10) </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [PHOTIUS] They say that this Demas again turned away to Hellenism and became a priest of idols. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the Photius excerpt</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash; [OECUMENIUS] And if that was at first, now Demas has repented. But if later, after these things he became negligent. [</span><span class="c0 c1">end of the excerpt by Oecumenius</span><span class="c2 c0">] &mdash; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Luke</span><span class="c0">. The last became first. For if in the second letter to Timothy he says, Luke is the only one with me. (2 Tim. 4:11) And Paul calls them </span><span class="c0 c1">co-workers</span><span class="c2 c0">, showing that these also, he says, are encouraging you with me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Finished, with divine help, the Epistle to Philemon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Written from Rome, through Onesimus the servant.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><div><p class="c6 c27"><span class="c2 c25"></span></p><p class="c27 c6"><span class="c2 c25"></span></p></div></body></html>
