Not everyone agrees that this was written by Oecumenius. I go into this in more detail in the introduction of my recent translation of the commentary on Hebrews by Oecumenius. This commentary was written by Oecumenius as a compilation of quotes from various Early Church Fathers that lived prior to him, which is in the manner called </span><span class="c1">Catena</span><span class="c4">. In this version that I translated, which is from the Patrologia Graeca, volume 119, printed in 1864, does not have any indicators showing that any of the content comes from any specific ancient Christian writer, and it has the appearance of being written as a running commentary by Oecumenius himself. According to Dr. Karl Staab, in his edition called &ldquo;Pauline commentaries from the Greek Church&rdquo; [</span><span class="c1">Pauluskommentare aus der griechischen Kirche</span><span class="c4">], there are two excerpts for the letter to Philemon which indicate that one excerpt is by Photius of Constantinople, and one by Oecumenius himself, both found in the comments on verse 24. I added indicators for those two excerpts in this translation. According to my thesis, Photius (810-891A.D.) lived after Oecumenius (6</span><span class="c4 c20">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;century), which means that the excerpt by Photius was added to the text of the catena by a later copyist. Oecumenius depended greatly upon the homilies and commentaries of John Chrysostom (died around 407A.D.) for his own catenae/commentaries on Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, though Oecumenius condensed and reworked what Chrysostom wrote. Oecumenius also relied upon Theodoret of Cyrus (393-457A.D.), as can be seen in the Preface. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">COMMENTARY BY OECUMENIUS </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">ON THE EPISTLE TO PHILEMON</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">HYPOTHESIS ON THE EPISTLE TO PHILEMON</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Paul sends this from Rome; and the cause of the letter is this: Onesimus, the servant of Philemon, fled; and having gone to the apostle Paul, he was instructed by him, and became useful to him in ministry. Therefore, he writes to Philemon about this, praising Onesimus, so that he may receive him sincerely, and no longer have him as a slave, but as a brother. He also urged him to prepare a welcome for him, so that if he comes, he may find a place to stay. And thus, he completes the letter. It is noteworthy that this Onesimus was also deemed worthy of martyrdom in the city of Rome, at that time under the authority of Tertullus the governor, having endured the breaking of his legs as to undergo martyrdom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">THEODORET</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Philemon was a remarkable man, a Phrygian by birth, and his city was Colossae; he was faithful in character and shared in the needs of the saints. Onesimus, a slave of his, ran away, having stolen from him. Onesimus, coming to Rome to Paul, was instructed by him and, having been baptized, became remarkable even while Paul was in chains. Paul sends him back to Philemon, having made this letter a recommendation for Onesimus. Some say that this letter should not be counted among the other epistles because it concerns a trivial matter. But see how many useful things come from it! First, it teaches us to be earnest even about trivial matters. Second, that if a slave has returned so boldly, those who are free should not despise them. Third, that it is not fitting, under the pretense of holiness, to separate slaves against the will of their masters. Fourth, that we should not be ashamed of virtuous slaves, especially when Paul calls Onesimus his child. How then could such a letter, containing so much benefit, not be counted among the others? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">The Epistle to Philemon by the Apostle Paul</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10">Philemon 1-3</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker, and to Apphia our beloved, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Paul, a prisoner</span><span class="c0">. Immediately from the opening words he instructs the master not to shame the servant. For all things, even chains, are good for Christ. And that it is right for grace to be given to the prisoner for Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">and Timothy our brother</span><span class="c0">. He includes Timothy as a partner in the supplication.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">to Philemon our beloved</span><span class="c0">. If beloved, he will grant favor; if a coworker, he will not put the servant to shame in the service of the preaching. Onesimus, having been given, will also fulfill the work of the master Philemon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">and to Apphia our beloved, and Archippus</span><span class="c4">. Perhaps Apphia was the wife of Philemon, and Archippus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">But see the humility, for it also urges these to join in the supplication.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">our fellow soldier</span><span class="c0">. If a fellow soldier, he also struggles in this. This is the one about whom he writes to the Colossians: Tell Archippus, &quot;Take heed to the ministry which you have received.&quot; (Co. 4:17)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">and to the church in your house</span><span class="c0">. He invites the whole household, and slaves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Grace to you</span><span class="c0">. How then will the grace of God be with you? If you also forgive those who owe you. How then is peace? If you are reconciled to the servant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c17">The praise of Philemon and a thanksgiving on his behalf.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10">Philemon 4-9</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">I always thank my God, making mention of you in my prayers, hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints; that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. Therefore, having great boldness in Christ, I am commanding you what is proper, because of love, I urge you, being such as Paul the aged, but now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">If ever </span><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;make </span><span class="c1">mention of you</span><span class="c4">, I always do, </span><span class="c1">I give thanks to God</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for you. Why? </span><span class="c1">Hearing of your love and faith</span><span class="c4">, he says. Do you see that he does not immediately seek favor from the beginning?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">hearing of your love</span><span class="c0">. which, if it were not great, would by no means be heard from Phrygia all the way to Rome.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">that the fellowship of your faith</span><span class="c4">. It unites him to himself, just as if he said: Fellowship of faith is that which makes one and common. But why do you give thanks to God? So </span><span class="c1">that the</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">fellowship of your faith</span><span class="c4">, he says, </span><span class="c1">may become effective</span><span class="c4">. But how will it be effective? If it proceeds to every work of virtue. Blessed Paul interprets himself. But how will it be </span><span class="c1">effective</span><span class="c4">? By this, that you have </span><span class="c1">the knowledge</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and accomplish </span><span class="c1">every good thing</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">that is in us</span><span class="c0">. He says that which is now also in us. (Matt. 25:40)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">for Christ Jesus</span><span class="c0">. For whoever does good to someone, does it to Christ, especially to the saints.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">we have great joy</span><span class="c0">. Not only, Paul says, did we rejoice, but such was the pleasure that it even brought us comfort while in bonds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">because the hearts of the saints</span><span class="c0">. See! He wishes to say: If you grant favors to others, much more grant them to me; thus he does not say; but otherwise more skillfully. For he knows the memory of benefits done to others makes those who are urged more obedient.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">have been refreshed through you</span><span class="c0">. For, Paul says, they find rest in your love. They rest because of you. Since you are such a one toward the saints as to also give them rest, I have the boldness to command you. Having boldness because of Christ; to command you a fitting thing; for this is what is proper. But I said to command, not because I rule over you, but because of the love which I love you and am loved by you, I seem to command, but I do not command. For even if I appear to command you, it is out of love that I do not command but rather encourage. Thus, I do the matter with great regard. Being such a one, as Paul an elder. And I exhort, being such a one as one ought to be, he says, to persuade.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Paul</span><span class="c0">. And this alone is sufficient to persuade, </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">the aged, but now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ</span><span class="c0">. Do you see the motives for persuading?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Recommendation of Onesimus, a runaway servant, and an appeal on his behalf, who has been saved through faith.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10">Philemon 10-14</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">I therefore appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my chains, formerly useless to you, but now indeed useful both to you and to me, whom I have sent back. I appeal to you to receive him as my very heart: whom I wished to keep with me, so that he might serve me in the chains of the gospel on your behalf; but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed would not be forced but voluntary</span><span class="c8">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Paul mentions Philemon first, praising the servant as a beloved child, because he says he also baptized him. For this is the one, &quot;</span><span class="c1">I have begotten while in my chains</span><span class="c4">.&quot; Therefore, having calmed his anger through these things, he thus gives the name </span><span class="c1">Onesimus</span><span class="c0">, he says.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">formerly useless to you</span><span class="c0">. For he knows that the acknowledged sin is to extinguish the master&#39;s anger.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">but now indeed useful both to you and to me</span><span class="c0">. If such faithfulness is useful to Paul, who demands so much, it is clearly also useful to Philemon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">whom I have sent back</span><span class="c0">. To hand Onesimus over to the master, rather extinguished his anger. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">to receive him as my very heart</span><span class="c4">. What do I mean by &quot;</span><span class="c1">receive him</span><span class="c4">&quot;? Receiving this one, you will receive my own very </span><span class="c1">heart</span><span class="c4">. Thus he says, I love him as one calls him his own </span><span class="c1">heart</span><span class="c4">. And &quot;</span><span class="c1">receive</span><span class="c0">&quot; means to accept with love.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">so that he might serve me in the chains of the gospel on your behalf</span><span class="c4">. Do you see that Paul has brought the master to the very place, little by little? For he says that </span><span class="c1">he serves me on your behalf</span><span class="c0">. Here he shows that he wishes what is more advantageous for the master. For if you say that you ought to serve, and he does this instead of you, the benefit is yours.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">in the chains of the gospel</span><span class="c0">. In chains for the sake of the Gospel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">without your consent</span><span class="c0">. This was especially humiliating for him, that he did not do something so necessary for him without your consent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">so that your good deed would not be forced but voluntary</span><span class="c0">. Paul did not say, &quot;By force,&quot; but, &quot;would not be forced;&quot; as if he had said, &quot;I knew that even against your will, forcing Onesimus on you, I would not cause you pain. But so that it may not seem to be done by force, I was not willing,&quot; he says. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10">Philemon 15-20</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">For I suppose that for this reason he was separated for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would me. And if he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge that to me. I, Paul, write this with my own hand&mdash;I will repay it&mdash;to avoid saying to you that you owe me your own self as well. Yes, brother. May I enjoy refreshment in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since Onesimus has changed his mind from being a wicked one, he himself turns it to the doubtful, as if he said: For perhaps he fled for reasons of caution.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">for this reason he was separated</span><span class="c0">. With a euphemistic name, Paul called it separation, so that the memory of the separation would not provoke the master. Then he also limits the time, calming the anger, or he speaks in terms of a season of the year.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">so that you might have him back forever</span><span class="c0">, you have, that is, you receive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But more than a slave</span><span class="c4">. Do you see that escaping brought many benefits? For instead of an hour of escape, you have an eternal one. (For the escape is but one hour compared to eternity.) And instead of a worthless slave, you have received </span><span class="c1">a beloved brother</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">how much more to you</span><span class="c4">. If to me, much more to you, even in worldly services. For this is &quot;</span><span class="c1">in the flesh</span><span class="c4">.&quot; And in spiritual matters. For this is &quot;</span><span class="c1">in the Lord</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So if you consider me a partner</span><span class="c0">. That is, if you think and wish the same things as I do.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">welcome him as you would me</span><span class="c0">. Wow, how great is the magnitude of those words!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And if he has wronged you</span><span class="c4">. Paul did not say, &quot;He stole,&quot; but the verb is cut short. He says he </span><span class="c1">wronged</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">or owes</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">charge that to me</span><span class="c4">. For it was likely that they themselves had consumed together the things that had been stolen, and Paul says, &quot;</span><span class="c1">charge this to me</span><span class="c0">,&quot; that is, charge these things as a debt to me, let the obligation be held against me. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I, Paul, write</span><span class="c0">. He wrote with spiritual grace, as if he said, But for safe keeping, that I will repay the debt, I have made the letters with my own hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">to avoid saying to you that you owe me your own self as well</span><span class="c0">. So that Paul may not seem to insult him by not daring to appeal to him openly on behalf of the runaway slave (for this would show Philemon to be somewhat harsh), it shows that Paul is also very confident in Philemon. For he says not only your own things, but also yourself you owe to me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yes, brother</span><span class="c4">. Again, from what is pleasing it advances to what is serious. &quot;</span><span class="c1">Yes</span><span class="c4">,&quot; he said, &quot;</span><span class="c1">brother</span><span class="c0">.&quot; What? Accept it yourself. I will take advantage from you in things that are according to Christ.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">May I enjoy</span><span class="c0">. That is, I delight in your excellent works in the Lord. May I see you growing rich in all spiritual blessings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">refresh my heart</span><span class="c0">. Paul says, Refresh my love for you for the sake of Christ.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10">Philemon 21-25</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">I wrote to you, confident in your obedience, knowing that you will also do more than I say. At the same time, prepare a lodging for me; for I hope that through your prayers I will be granted the opportunity to come to you. Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings, as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen</span><span class="c8">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">confident</span><span class="c0">. Paul said, &quot;You do this not for me, but for Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">confident in your obedience</span><span class="c4">. I did not write to you as one commanding or stubbornly dealing with you, but having confidence </span><span class="c1">in your obedience</span><span class="c0">. Whom would these things not soften, even if he were made of iron?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">knowing that you will also do more than I say</span><span class="c0">. Paul said this, persuading Philemon in every way to accept Onesimus, if not for any other reason, then at least so as not to destroy his own reputation if he had any with the Apostle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">prepare a lodging for me</span><span class="c4">. Paul says that he did not write only because of Onesimus (for Philemon would have said, if not for himself, that I was not worthy of even a word), but also for this reason, he says, that you might </span><span class="c1">prepare a lodging for me</span><span class="c0">. And Philemon was even afraid that if he did not receive Onesimus, the Apostle would come and it would be known that he had been disobedient.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">for I hope that through your prayers</span><span class="c0">. Great indeed is the power of prayers, and great also is the humility of Paul, because he was in need of those prayers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner</span><span class="c0">. This man was sent from the Colossians to Paul, as it is clear that Philemon was from Colossae. He is called a fellow prisoner, indicating that he too was in great distress. Moreover, this also honors him; for Epaphras was indeed a fellow prisoner, whereas this one did not even show kindness to Onesimus, who was a prisoner for the Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Aristarchus, Demas</span><span class="c0">.
