<FONT  SIZE=4>Letter VI. To Anastasius, Bishop of Thessalonica.</FONT></H2>

<P><I>Leo to his beloved brother Anastasius.</I></P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P469_68374"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>I. He is Pleased to Have Been Consulted by the Bishops<SUP><A HREF="#P470_68429">1</A></SUP> Illyricum an Important Questions.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>The brotherly love of our colleagues makes us read with grateful mind the letters of all priests<SUP><A HREF="#P472_68674">2</A></SUP> ; for in them we embrace one another in the spirit as if we were face to face, and by the intercourse of such epistles we are associated in mutual converse<SUP><A HREF="#P473_68896">3</A></SUP> . But in this present letter the affection displayed seems to us greater than usual: for it informs us of the state of the churches<SUP><A HREF="#P474_69216">4</A></SUP> , and urges us to a vigilant exercise of care by a consideration of our office, so that being placed, as it were, on a watch-tower, according to the will of the Lord, we should both lend our approval to things when they run in accordance with our wishes, and correct, by applying the remedies of compulsion, what we observe gone wrong through any aggression: hoping that abundant fruit will be the result of our sowing the seed, if we do not allow those things to increase which have begun to spring up to the spoiling of the harvest.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P476_69775"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>II. Following the Examples of His Predecessors He Nominates Anastasius Metropolitan of Illyricum.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Now therefore, dear brother, that your request has been made known to us through our son Nicolaus the priest, that you, too, like your predecessors, might receive from us in our turn authority over Illyricum for the observance of the rules, we give our consent and earnestly exhort that no concealment and no negligence may be allowed in the management of the churches situated throughout Illyricum, which we commit to you in our stead, following the precedent of Siricius of blessed remembrance, who then, for the first time, acting on a fixed method, entrusted them to your last predecessor but one<SUP><A HREF="#P478_70473">5</A></SUP> , Anysius of holy memory, who had at the time well deserved of the Apostolic See, and was approved by after events: that he might render assistance to the churches situated in that province whom he wished kept up to discipline. Noble precedents must be followed with eagerness that we may show ourselves in all things like those whose privileges we wish to enjoy. We wish you to imitate your last predecessor<SUP><A HREF="#P479_71071">6</A></SUP> but one as well as of your immediate predecessor who is known equally with the former to have both deserved and employed this privilege: so that we may rejoice in the progress of the churches which we commit to you in our stead. For as the conduct of matters progresses creditably when committed to one who acts well and carries out skilfully the duties of the priestly position, so it is found to be only a burden to him who, when power is entrusted to him, uses not the moderation that is due.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P481_71757"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>III. Ordinees Must Be Carefully Selected with Especial Reference to Thecanons of the Church.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>And so, dear brother, hold with vigilance the helm entrusted to you, and direct your mind's gaze around on all which you see put in your charge, guarding what will conduce to your reward and resisting those who strive to upset the discipline of the canons. The sanction of God's law must be respected, and the decrees of the canons should be more especially kept. Throughout the provinces committed to thee let such priests be consecrated to the Lord as are commended only by their deserving life and position among the clergy. Permit no licence to personal favour, nor to canvassing, nor to purchased votes. Let the cases of those who are to be ordained be investigated carefully and let them be trained in the discipline of the Church through a considerable period of their life. But if all the requirements of the holy Fathers are found in them, and if they have observed all that we read the blessed Apostle Paul to have enjoined on such, viz., that he be the husband of one wife, and that she was a virgin when he married her, as the authority of God's law requires,[then ordain them<SUP><A HREF="#P483_72938">7</A></SUP> ]. And this we are extremely anxious should be observed, so as to do away with all place for excuses, lest any one should believe himself able to attain to the priesthood who has taken a wife before he obtained the grace of Christ, and on her decease joinedhimself to another after baptism. Seeing that the former wife cannot be ignored, nor the previous marriage put out of the reckoning, and that he is as much the father of the children whom he begot by that wife before baptism as he is of those whom he is known to have begotten by the second after baptism. For as sins and things which are known to be unlawful are washed away in the font of baptism, so what are allowedor lawful are not done away.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P485_73775"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>IV. The Metropolitans Must Not Ordain Hastily Nor Without Consultingtheir Primate.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Let one be ordained a priest<SUP><A HREF="#P487_73886">8</A></SUP> throughout these churches inconsiderately; for by this means ripe judgments will be formed about those to be elected, if your scrutiny, brother, is dreaded. But let any bishop who, contrary to our command, is ordained by his metropolitan without your knowledge, know that he has no assured position with us, and that those who have taken on themselves so to do must render an account of their presumption<SUP><A HREF="#P488_74392">9</A></SUP> . But as to each metropolitan is committed such power that he has the right of ordaining in his province, so we wish those metropolitans to be ordained, but not without ripe and well-considered judgment. For although it is seemly that all who are consecrated priests should be approved and well-pleasing to God, yet we wish those to have peculiar excellence whom we know are going to preside over the fellow-priests who are assigned to them. And we admonish you, beloved, to see to this the more diligently and carefully, that you may be proved to keep that precept of the Apostles which runs, "lay hands suddenly on no man<SUP><A HREF="#P489_75219">10</A></SUP> ."</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P491_75239"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>V. Points Which Cannot Be Settled at the Provincial Synod are to Be Referred to Rome.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Any of the brethren who has been summoned to a synod should attend and not deny himself to the holy congregation: for there especially he should know that what will conduce to the good discipline of the Church must be settled. For all faults will be better avoided if more frequent conferences take place between the priests of the Lord, and intimate association is the greatest help alike to improvement and to brotherly love. There, if any questions arise, under the Lord's guidance they will be able to be determined, so that no bad feeling remains, and only a firmer love exists among the brethren. But if any more important question spring up, such as cannot be settled there under your presidency, brother, send your report and consult us, so that we may write back under the revelation of the Lord, of whose mercy it is that we can do ought, because He has breathed favourably upon us<SUP><A HREF="#P493_76217">11</A></SUP> : that by our decision we may vindicate our right of cognizance in accordance with old-established tradition and the respect that is due to the Apostolic See: for as we wish you to exercise your authority in our stead, so we reserve to ourselves points which cannot be decided on the spot and persons who have made appeal to us.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P495_76672"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>VI. Priests and Deacons May Not Be Ordained on Weekdays Any More Than Bishops.</FONT></P>

  </UL><P>You shall take order that this letter reach the knowledge of all the brethren, so that no one hereafter find an opportunity to excuse himself through ignorance in observing these things which we command. We have directed our letter of admonition<SUP><A HREF="#P497_76997">12</A></SUP> to the metropolitans themselves also of the several provinces, that they may know that they must obey the Apostolic injunctions, and that they obey us in beginning to obey you, brother, our delegate according to what we have written. We hear, indeed, and we cannot pass it over in silence, that only bishops are ordained by certain brethren on Sundays only; but presbyters and deacons, whose consecration should be equally solemn<SUP><A HREF="#P498_77448">13</A></SUP> , receive the dignity of the priestly office indiscriminately on any day, which is a reprehensible practice contrary to the canons and tradition of the Fathers<SUP><A HREF="#P499_77781">14</A></SUP> , since the custom ought by all means to be kept by those who have received it with respect to all the sacred orders: so that after a proper lapse of time he who is to be ordained a priest or deacon<SUP><A HREF="#P500_78129">15</A></SUP> may be advanced through all the ranks of the clerical office, and thus a man may have time to learn that of which he himself also is one day to be a teacher. Dated the 12th of January, in the consulship of Theodosius(18th time) and Albinus(444).</P>


<br><br><sup id="P470_68429">1</sup>: The letter to the college of bishops was written the same day, and forms No. 5 in the Leonine series(in Migne).
<br><br><sup id="P472_68674">2</sup>: Sacerdotum here obviously = episcoporum , see Letter 1. note 5.
<br><br><sup id="P473_68896">3</sup>: quibus sermone epistolis mutuo commeant bus sociamur . notice the interlaced order of the words in the sentence which is not, I think, without design as quaintly expressing his meaning.
<br><br><sup id="P474_69216">4</sup>: Sc. In your province.
<br><br><sup id="P478_70473">5</sup>: Siricius was Bishop of Rome 384-398. Damasus, 366-384, is said by Innocent 1. to have been the first to do this but not like Siricius, "acting on a fixed method," certa quadam ratione .
<br><br><sup id="P479_71071">6</sup>: Proedecessoris tui . Anysius is said to have lived on into the time of Innocent. Anastasius' immediate predecessor, selected by Innocent ( decessoris tui in the next line), was named Rufus.
<br><br><sup id="P483_72938">7</sup>: These words are not found in the mss. apparently, but are necessary to the sense. For the requirement cf. Letter IV. chapter iii.
<br><br><sup id="P487_73886">8</sup>: Here the word is antistes and no doubt it signifies "bishop," as the next sentence clearly shows.
<br><br><sup id="P488_74392">9</sup>: The organization of the province then included(1)the bishops under (2) metropolitans of district under (3) one supreme primate of the province, who was in his turn responsible to the Bishop of Rome.
<br><br><sup id="P489_75219">10</sup>: 1 Tim. v. 22.
<br><br><sup id="P493_76217">11</sup>: The word is as, aspiraverit (the notion of which is to favour), not inspiraverit (to Inspire), as we might have expected.
<br><br><sup id="P497_76997">12</sup>: Viz., Letter V.
<br><br><sup id="P498_77448">13</sup>: Circa quos par consecratio fieri debet . I take this as a valuable statement in the mouth of Leo, who so seldom refers specifically to the lower orders of the ministry.
<br><br><sup id="P499_77781">14</sup>: There seems to be no canon on the point before Leo's time: but he alludes to the tradition again in Letter IX. Chap. 1 and CXI. Chap. 2 (q.v.).
<br><br><sup id="P500_78129">15</sup>: Qui sacerdos (? Secundi ordinis here) vel levita (= diaconus ) ordinandus est.
