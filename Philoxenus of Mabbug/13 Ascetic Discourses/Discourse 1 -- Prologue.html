  <p>[Page 3], THE DISCOURSES UPON DISCIPLINE OF LIFE AND CHARACTER WHICH WERE
  DELIVERED BY THE BLESSED MAR PHILOXENUS, BISHOP OF MABBOGH, IN WHICH IS SET
  FORTH THE WHOLE ORDER OF INSTRUCTION ---- HOW A MAN SHOULD BEGIN THE
  DISCIPLESHIP OF CHRIST, AND IN WHAT LAWS AND MANNER OF LIFE HE SHOULD WALK
  UNTIL HE ARRIVETH AT SPIRITUAL LOVE, FROM WHICH IS BORN PERFECTION, AND IN
  WHICH WE BECOME CHILDREN OF THE LIKENESS OF CHRIST, EVEN AS SPAKE PAUL THE
  APOSTLE.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> NOW THE FIRST DISCOURSE IS BY THE GRACE
  OF OUR LORD THE PROLOGUE TO ALL THIS VOLUME.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Lord and our Redeemer Jesus Christ in His living Gospel invited us to
draw nigh in wisdom to the work of keeping His commandments, and to lay within
ourselves the foundation of His discipline rightly, in order that the edifice of
our life and character might mount up straightly. For he who knoweth not how to
begin wisely the building of this tower which goeth up to heaven is not able to
complete [it] or to bring it to the finish which is of wisdom. For knowledge and
wisdom should order, and arrange, and [p. 4] work the beginning and end and
founding<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> [of the edifice], <A NAME="p2"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|2</SPAN></A>
and whosoever beginneth thus is called a wise man by the word of our Redeemer,
&quot;Whosoever heareth these My words, and doeth them, is like unto a wise man
who hath dug, and made deep, and set his building upon the rock: and the rain
descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house;
and it fell not; for its foundations were laid upon the rock. But whosoever
heareth and doeth not, is like unto a foolish man who set his building upon the
sand, and even if feeble things beat upon his building they will sweep it
away&quot;.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> We are therefore bound by the word of
our Teacher not to be constant listeners only to the Word of God but also
constant doers.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> For the man who, though listening
not, doeth, is better than the man who is constant in listening and empty of
works, even as the word of the apostle Paul teacheth us, &quot;For not the
hearers of the law are righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be
justified: for if the Gentiles which have no law do by their own nature [the
things] of the law, these, having no law, are a law unto themselves; and they
show the work of the law written upon their hearts, and their conscience
testifieth concerning them&quot;.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> The hearing of
the law is good, for it bringeth to the works thereof, [p. 5] and reading and
meditation in the Scriptures, which purify our secret understanding from
thoughts of evil things, are good, but if a man is constant in reading, and in
hearing, and in the meditation of the word of <A NAME="p3"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|3</SPAN></A>
God, and yet perfecteth not by his reading the labour of works, against this man
hath the Spirit of God spoken by the hand of the blessed David, rebuking and
reproving his wickedness, and restraining him from taking even the Holy Book
into his polluted hands, saying, &quot;For to the sinner speaketh God, What
&quot;hast thou [to do] with the books of My commandments, that thou hast taken
My covenant in thy mouth? Thou hast hated My instruction, and thou hast cast My
words behind thee,&quot;<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> together with the other
things which are written after these. Now as for the man who is constant in
reading and remote from deeds, his reading is his own condemnation, and he is
the more deserving of judgment, in that while he listeneth every day, he mocketh
and is contemptuous every day, and he is thenceforth like a dead man and a
corpse which hath no feeling, for if ten thousand trumpets and horns were to
blow in the ear of a dead man he would not hear [them]; even thus is the soul
which is dead in sins. And the understanding, from which the remembrance of God
hath perished in the death-dealing error of the thoughts [of evil things], will
not hear the sound of the cries of the divine voices, nor will the trumpet of
the word of the Spirit move it, but it is sunk into the sleep of death which is
pleasant to it; and although dying, it perceiveth not its death that it might
turn and seek life for itself. And as the man who hath died according to nature
is not sensible of his death, even so the dead man who dieth by his own will to
the knowledge of God feeleth not his death, [p. 6] nor perceiveth his
destruction, that he might find <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A> a way
and seek out an invention of life for himself. For also when God saw the dying
condition of the Jews who of their own will stopped their ears, and blinded
their eyes, and made thick their hearts against the remembrance of the knowledge
of God, He stirred up Isaiah to rouse them up, and cried to him to cry into
their ears, saying, &quot;Cry with thy throat, and spare not, and lift up thy
voice like a trumpet, and shew My people their iniquity, and the house of Jacob
their sins&quot;.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> And again in another place<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
the same prophet saith, &quot;He said to me, Cry. And I said, What shall I cry?
All flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof is like the grass of the
field&quot;. Yea, &quot;like the grass&quot; and like the herb which drieth up
before the sun, which when once its natural juiciness and moisture have dried up
neither the rain nor all the watering of the fountains can make grow green
again, even so became the nation which was dead to all the vivification of the
Spirit, and like grass and straw it became dry and withered by reason of the
noonday heat of error, and by the hotness of evil things. The soul dieth without
the remembrance of God, and when it dieth all its discretion dieth therewith,
and all its emotions of thought of heavenly things are annihilated therefrom.
While the soul liveth in its natural state it is dying by its own desire; and
while it is found in uprightness it is lost in respect of its freedom.</p>
<p>The disciple of God, then, should seek to have the remembrance of his Master
Jesus Christ fixed in his soul and to meditate upon it day and night, [p. 7] And
it is right for him to know where he should begin, and <A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A>
how and where he must raise the structure of his building, and how he should
begin and finish it, that he be not laughed at by all those who pass along the
road, even as our Lord spake concerning that man who began to build a tower and
was not able to finish it, that he became a laughing-stock and a mockery to all
who saw him.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> And who is this man who began the
building of the tower of whom our Redeemer spake, if it be not the man who
setteth out on the path of the Gospel of Christ? Now the beginning of the
building of this disciple who hath agreed to go forth from the world and to keep
the commandments is his promise and his covenant with God; and he should begin,
and run his course, and finish it, collecting and bringing together from all
places fine stones of a noble life and character for the building of the tower
which reacheth up to heaven. Now the foundation is set and laid, and is,
according to the word of Paul,<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> &quot;Jesus Christ
our God,&quot; and every man, howsoever he pleaseth, buildeth upon that
foundation. For by His love the foundation hath been laid down once and for all
to receive everything which might be set upon it, until the coming of the day of
the revelation in which the work of every man will be tested and proved; and He
who hath been the foundation stone in the corner of the building will go up and
become the Judge and Head in the top of the building. And according to what Paul
himself spake, &quot;If any man buildeth on this foundation gold, [p. 8] or
silver, or stones of price, or wood, or hay, or stubble, each man's work shall
be revealed, for that day shall reveal it, inasmuch as <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A>
it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall prove each man's work of what
sort it is.&quot;<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> Now Paul likeneth the conduct
of Christian life and character and the beauties of righteousness to gold and
silver and precious stones, and among these faith is as gold, and the
restraining of the passions and desires, and fasting, and self-denial and the
other works of righteousness are as silver; and he likeneth to precious stones
love, and peace, and hope, and pure thoughts, and holy meditations, and a mind
which is wholly afraid in the Spirit, and which at all times reserveth in all
its emotions wonder at God and admiration for the majesty of His Being, and an
understanding which keepeth silence in trembling before the inexplicable and
inexpressible mysteries of God. Now these heavenly thoughts, and emotions, and
anxious fears, and life of the Spirit Paul calleth &quot;precious stones;&quot;
and error and wickedness and the ministry of all the lusts he calleth wood, and
hay, and stubble. And since the building itself is fixed in the ground every man
can build and raise upon it whatsoever he pleaseth, until the day which shall
decide is revealed, and He shall come of Whom it is said, &quot;He holdeth His
fan in His hand and He will purify His threshing-floors; and He will gather His
wheat into the garner, but the straw He will burn up with unquenchable
fire.&quot;<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> And the Husbandman who planted in the
world the tree of our mankind will shew Himself [to be] the Judge, and He will
hold in His hand the axe for cutting down [p. 9], and every tree which beareth
not good fruit He will cut down and cast into the fire. When that Fisherman <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>
who hath cast His net into the sea of the world, and hath filled it with fish,
both great and small, which are the races and families of mankind, and the
nations and tribes of the children of flesh, of divers tongues and innumerable
kinds, shall appear He will strike and bring up His net to the sea shore, even
as He Himself hath said, and He will gather together the fine fish and cast them
into His baskets,<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> which are the living treasuries
of His kingdom, and the poor ones He will cast forth into outer darkness, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. These things are laid up to take
place through Him at that time when the Prince of the shepherds shall be
revealed in the glory of His kingdom. The time of trial is one, the time of
teaching is another, the time of reading is another, and the time of proving is
another; and as in this season of teaching there is no [time of] trial, even so
in that season of trial there will be no [time of] teaching.</p>
<p>Let us therefore, my beloved, hearken unto the living voice of God Who hath
called us to give us life everlasting. His voices are filled with life, and they
give life unto him that will hearken unto them. With life are those living
voices filled, and by the living voices is life given unto those who with a
living hearing incline their ears unto their words.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as it is meet for us to speak separately concerning each matter
in its place, and to make known in our discourse which cometh first and which
cometh last, and how these good things, one after the other, should be kept and
perfected, [p. 10] we have composed this introduction to be an encouragement to
the <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A> reader [to proceed] to the wealth
of the things which follow after. For it is meet for the man who would begin in
the way of the Commandments, of Christ to know where he should begin, and what
stone should properly be the first in the edifice of his instruction, and what
stone should be second, and what stone should be third, lest being ignorant of
the art of building, and not having learned where to begin, he know not also
where and how to finish, and lest, by reason of his lack of knowledge of
instruction, he make the last things first and the first last, and place some of
them in the middle. Now if the farmers and husbandmen of [this] world know that
there are certain seasons for sowing grain and planting trees, and others for
harvest and the ingathering of fruit, and they preserve the order of the seasons
that their affairs suffer not injury and become not confused, how much more is
it meet for the spiritual farmer and husbandman and for the true disciple to
know what things befit his first beginning in instruction, and where it is
proper for him to begin? so that having laid the first stone in its place in the
foundation of his teaching, he may build up the whole of the building according
to the law. And in this manner both builders and architects work, for having
begun to lay the foundation of their building with fine, large stones, and great
strong doorposts and sockets,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> even though they
set in the building itself those which are inferior, the solid foundation is
able to receive and to carry substances which are less strong. But if in the
foundations which <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A> are beneath they
were to lay [p. 11] small or bad stones, and upon them massive and fine stones,
all their building would be overturned and would fall down. And again, let us
take an example also from the learned who transmit instruction to the young, and
who teach them knowledge according to rule. They do not pass over [certain of
the] canons of instruction and disturb the order thereof and the consecutiveness
of human learning, but they know which to give first and which should follow
after, until the learner arriveth at the limit of his capacity for learning. And
so also according to law is this instruction in proper order known among all the
handicrafts of the world. For those things which are given to apprentices to do
when they first of all begin to learn their craft, are, according to their
feeble capacity, the unimportant things in the handicraft, and their masters
shew them how to do them, so that if it should happen that there be a loss the
loss is a little one. Even so is it with those who learn the art of the strife
of the Christian life, for it is laid down for them with what forms of contests
they must begin with first of all, and with what grades they must mount up and
ascend in the art of the strife of the Christian life. First of all they must
learn to exhibit towards each other the readiness of standing in position, and
after this they must throw their hands each upon each, and thus they are
stimulated, and draw nigh to the perfect contest.</p>
<p>And again also those who are chosen for the military service of [this] world
learn the art of war on this system, [p. 12] and their instruction is neither
confounded nor confused, but each of the things which they learn they learn in
its proper place and order. And so with every <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A>
thing else in [this] world, of which the beginning and middle and end are known.
Now therefore, [judging] from the examples of the demonstrations which we have
brought, this systematic order of things is especially useful to us, and the
knowledge of the first rule of conduct of the Christian life and of that which
followeth is very necessary for us; for it is in this world that the art of
spiritual strife is to be learned, and we have been chosen for the service of
those who are in heaven. And just as those who are chosen to perform service
before the kings of [this] world learn the king's laws and customs from those
who have served before them, and those who come last learn from those who have
been before them how to walk, and how to dress and how to talk, and how far they
may properly speak in his presence, and those who have been newly chosen [learn]
from those who have been before them, even so also in this case it is necessary
for the man who hath been chosen, whether by his own decision or by the promise
of his parents that he should serve Christ, that he should learn this service
from those who have [served] before him, or from the Holy Scriptures, or from
men of the spirit who have walked in this path according to the law, and who
began with works, and have finished in the spirit and have been made perfect in
love.</p>
<p>Now those lusts which fight against us in the beginning [p. 13] of our youth
are well known, and also those which war against us in the middle of youth, and
at the end of the period of youth. And those which fight against us in the
beginning, and middle, and end of [our] manhood, and those [which fight against
us] in the stage which is after manhood in the <A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A>
self-same manner, even from the beginning until the end of this period, are well
known; and also those passions, which in the time of old age war against us
until our going forth from the world, and also what are those which come into
being from us in infancy and childhood in emotions and natural movements, before
the discernment of freewill hath been moved in it, and before we arrive at the
knowledge which distinguisheth virtues from vices. And moreover, it is meet that
we should know at the time when we are leading the Christian life and doing the
works thereof which passion fighteth with which, and which lust contendeth with
which, and at the end of that good work what evil thing can be stirred up
against us, and how in [our] overcoming one lust another gaineth the victory,
and how when we have subdued the lusts of the body there is stirred up against
us the war of the passions of the soul, and how when we have cast out the evil
thing from us it returneth to array itself with our innermost thoughts, and when
we have slain it in our bodily members it cometh to life in the living motions
of the soul, and when we have cut it off and cast it out from us it entereth and
lieth in ambush [p. 14] that it may be within us. And [we should know] what
feeling is born to the soul by the fasting of the body, and what feeling by
self-denial, and what feeling by singing psalms and hymns with the voice, and
what feeling by prayer in silence, and what feeling by the lack of possessions,
and what feeling by poverty of dress. And [we should know] what feeling is born
in us by general loving-kindness to all mankind, and what feeling is stirred up
in us when our conduct of life is more excellent than that of our brother, and
what feelings arise from the knowledge <A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A>
of the mind, and what feelings arise from words of instruction, and what
feelings arise from the words which are handed on to us in books. And [we should
know] into what feeling we shall fall when we have conquered the lust of the
belly in everything, and what feeling is stirred up against us at the end of the
triumph of the war against fornication, and what feeling is born in us by
obedience to those in authority, and by obedience to every man, and what are the
feelings which arise in us when we resist obedience, and by what doctrine the
opinion which will not be persuaded by its teachers may be abated, and by what
consideration we may root up from ourselves the doubt [which cometh] from
knowledge which ariseth in us against our soul. And [we should know] what
feelings can be conquered by other feelings, and what lusts can be abated by
others, and of what [nature] is the war against things of the body, and of what
[nature] is that which is against the things of the soul and against things of
the spirit, and [we should know] what it is meet that corporeal beings should do
when they wish to overcome the lusts of the body, and what beings endowed with
souls [should do] [p. 15] to overcome the passions of the soul, and what
spiritual beings [should do] to be delivered from the failings<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
which befall spiritual beings in the country of the spirit. And [we should know]
how far the fight can be extended in each one of these series, and how we may
know when the emotion of lust springeth from ourselves, and how and when it
befalleth us externally at the instigation of the Enemy, and by what things the
lust which is born of ourselves <A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A> and
that lust which the Adversary stirreth up against us may be overcome, and
whether by any means that same lust can be overcome at all times, or whether in
order to overcome at other times other means are necessary to us. And [we should
know] how, and by what [means], we may perceive when, either by the power of our
endurance or by the grace of God, our lusts have been vanquished by us, and what
manner of strife may be stirred up against us when we are among men, and also
what manner of strife may be raised up against us when we are in solitude, and
how the soul may be especially purified and cleansed, and what place is an
assistance to the labour of the body. And [we should know] with what things it
is meet that we should begin when we have drawn nigh to the discipleship of
Christ, and what feeling will be aroused in us at the praise which may be
bestowed upon us by people in authority, whether by reason of our knowledge or
on account of our rule of life, and what feeling will be aroused in us when we
are applauded by the greater number of the assembly in church. And [we should
know] with what thoughts we should observe the onset of passions, and how we may
guard ourselves from being disturbed by them when they attack us, and what [p.
16] opinions we may take unto ourselves when we overcome their struggling. And
[we should know] how we may obtain the possession of humility, and with what
thoughts we may abate in us the pride which is the opposite of humility, and
with what minds we may hold fast patience within ourselves. And [we should know]
what is the poverty of the body, and what is the renunciation of [the things of
this] world, and what is the poverty of the soul, and how when we <A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A>
have made ourselves beggars in respect of the riches of the things which are
seen we may possess the wealth of the gifts of Christ. And [we should know] what
commandments are meet for us to observe at the beginning of our instruction, and
how we should listen to our teachers, who give us counsel and teach us good
things, without observing their shortcomings. And [we should know] what power
our soul obtaineth from each, one of the virtues which are exercised by us, and
how it is meet for us to bear ourselves in a correct manner in the dwellings of
our brethren. And [we should know] to what extent it is right for us to fast,
and how at all times likewise [we may know] how to add unto or to diminish our
bodily food, and how and in what way it is meet for us to endure patiently when
the war of lust attacketh us. And [we should know] what to do when we desire to
quench the passions of the soul in ourselves, and with what meditation of the
mind we may root out enmity from us. And [we should know] how and whence pure
prayer is born in us, and what intuitions strike us by the admiration of God,
and how we should move within ourselves at all times a passion for God, and how
many are the feelings and aspects which belong to this passion for God, and how
when we come [p. 17] into a life of contemplation we may preserve our thoughts
from wandering outside ourselves. And [we should know] what loss will arise to a
man from communion with heretics, and how by human conversations and meetings
our heart is made thick, and how the remembrance and the thought of God are
darkened. And it is meet that we should know what is fasting of the body, and
what is fasting of the soul, and what is fasting of the spirit; and what is
purity of the body, and <A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A> purity of
the soul, and purity of the spirit; and what is poverty of the body, and poverty
of the soul, and poverty of the spirit. And [we should know] what are the
distinguishing characteristics of contemplation of the body, and of the soul,
and of the spirit; and how the soul may be taught to fast from evil things, even
also in like manner as the body is taught to fast from meats.</p>
<p>These and many other things like unto them the disciple of Christ is bound to
learn and to know in order to walk confidently on the path of his service, and
to do the will of the heavenly King Whom he serveth. For if those who learn the
handicrafts of [this] world learn carefully all the secrets of their trades, and
are incited to know all the [different] kinds of work which are in each of them,
how much more is it meet for him that hath been chosen for this spiritual
trade----if we are right in calling it a trade----to know all the ways, and
paths, and signs, and marks of the mysteries of this Divine manner of life? And
he should know that, although he is a man according to the body, he is chosen to
work spiritual things, and that, by the grace of God, he hath been held worthy
of the life of heavenly things, [p. 18] and that, although he existeth in the
flesh in [this] world, he should walk in the path which is superior to his
nature.</p>
<p>We are bound then, if we be disciples, to ask and to learn all those things
whereby we may obtain our living like disciples; and as disciples learn their
crafts from their masters, even, so let us learn and receive [instruction] from
our spiritual masters. Now no man is able to become a master except he be first
of all a disciple, and he cannot help and profit others unless he gathereth
useful things from others, and subdueth <A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A>
himself to receive [instruction] and to learn from every man, and esteemeth
every man greater and more excellent than himself. For our nature hath been
created, and when as yet we were not we existed in the will of the Creator, and
we have [but] recently been able to possess the doctrine of good things. And as
we came into existence from a condition of non-existence, even so from [being]
sinners have we become righteous. When once a man hath cast off the world wholly
he can then put on himself completely the manner of the life of Christ, for
until he hath cast off from himself the polluted garment, and hath cleansed
himself by means of tears of repentance from the blemishes of evil things, he
cannot array himself in the purple of the knowledge of Christ. The man who is
befouled either with thoughts or deeds of iniquity is first of all bound to heal
his sores, and to rub away the blemishes of his soul and body, and then he may
come to the feast chamber of divine mysteries, arrayed in the spiritual garments
of the feast. And for this reason it is especially meet that every one who
becometh a disciple of Christ should, from his earliest age, lay the foundation
of his instruction in such a way that all his [p. 19] subsequent growth may
receive goodly habits, and that the world may not exhaust the power of his soul
and body, after which he may draw nigh to this service like an old and worn out
vessel; but, according to what is said by our Lord,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
&quot;Let us put new wine into new bottles, and both will be preserved&quot;.
And thus in the beginning of our youth, when as yet our foundation is new, and
while our strength is yet in us, and our <A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A>
freshness hath not been made old by sin, let us put within ourselves the new
wine of the doctrine of Christ, that we may be able to endure the fervour of the
love of the doctrine of Christ, so that while we preserve it we may ourselves be
preserved through it from all evil things, more especially when the power of our
soul hath not been violated and carried off by the work of the service of
profane things.</p>
<p>Whosoever then would begin this course of life in his youth, it is meet for
him to be under the care of masters and to be obedient to their words without
judging their shortcomings. And those teachers also should put themselves in the
position of foster-parents to whom the bringing up of the children of the
heavenly king, whose father is a king, and whose brother is a king, and whose
mother is a queen, hath been delivered, And as those who educate the children of
a king of [this] world shew endless care for their growth and progress, and
watchfulness and zealousness to please their parents in them and the children
also when they arrive at the honour of royalty, even so also should the master
of disciples consider that he is educating the children of a king, and he should
be watchful and take heed to their custody and to their growth and progress.</p>
<p>[p. 20] It is meet also that we should be like unto physicians towards
ourselves and towards each other. For there is no physician who, being smitten
with pain in his own body, will not exercise care concerning it before [he
attendeth] to the healing of the sicknesses of others; if however, other people
fall sick, the law of the art of healing requireth him to run to heal them. And
like physicians it is meet that we should <A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A>
know first of all what are the causes of the pains and then should apply
medicines, so that we may not be unto the sick man a medicine which increaseth
the sickness. For we have received soul and body by the grace of God in the
construction of our created form, and it is required from us that we should take
care of both. Now as concerning sicknesses and bodily sufferings, that same
bodily nature maketh demands from us concerning meat, and drink, and clothing,
for those natural needs compel us to take thought for the body, and we are not
able to neglect it, even if we wish to do so, for the force of its feelings
draweth us to heal it, and the demands [made] by its needs [draw us] to supply
the things which it requireth. And concerning the healing of our soul, the
command of the word of God urgeth us to heal its sicknesses, and to cure its
sufferings, and to satisfy its hunger with the food of doctrine, and to give it
to drink of the knowledge of God, and to clothe it with the dress of belief, and
to shoe it with the preparation of hope, and to rear it in goodly habits, and in
the perfection of all good things, and in the obedience which is ready [p. 21]
for the work of the commandments of God, so that, our secret parts being holy
and our visible parts being pure, we may become vessels prepared for the Spirit
of God, so that He may dwell in us purely and holily, we having cured the
diseases which smite us by knowledge and wisdom, and having healed in our souls
the wounds of sin.</p>
<p>Now there is no single sickness of the lusts for which healing medicine is
not given to us by the word of God. For like as medicines are mixed and prepared
by the physicians for bodily sicknesses, even so <A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A>
are medicines made ready and prepared by the Spirit of God for the sufferings of
sin, so that whosoever perceiveth his sickness may find medicine by his side,
and may at once bring help nigh to himself; and every disease, as it appeareth
in most cases, can be healed by something which is opposite [in nature], in
order that the contrariety of the medicine may combat the injurious effect of
the disease. The sicknesses which arise through cold are healed by roots (<i>or </i>drugs)
having astringent properties, and those which arise through heat are helped to
decrease by things of a cooling nature. Thus also is it with those which arise
from dampness, for dryness cureth [them], and to heal those which arise from
moisture medicines which dry up are given.</p>
<p>From this similitude then, take an example, O understanding man, who desirest
to heal the sicknesses of the soul, and do to thy soul what the art of healing
doeth to thy body; for this work of things which are manifest is set before our
eyes that it may be a demonstration of doctrine for the things which are hidden.
And in the same way in which the body is healed let us heal the soul [p. 22]
from the sicknesses of evil things, and let us make ready the medicine which is
the antidote against every passion of sin&raquo; Against doubt, faith; against error,
truth; against suspicion, certain assurance; against lying, integrity; against
craft, simplicity; against cunning, uprightness; against wiliness, sincerity;
against hardness, gentleness; against asperity, graciousness; against the lust
of the body, the lust of the Spirit; against enjoyment, suffering; against joy
of this world, joy of Christ; against profane songs, psalms of the Spirit;
against lewdness, groanings and tears; against <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
prodigality in eating and drinking, fasting; against drinking unto drunkenness,
the parching thirst of prudence; against the rest of pleasure, labour; against
enjoyment, tribulation; against fleshly pleasure, pleasure of the thoughts which
rejoice in the Spirit; against speech, silent meditation; against external
conversations, silence; against slackness, strenuousness; against inactivity,
activity; against negligence of the thoughts, keenness of understanding; against
weariness, endurance; against cruelty, loving-kindness; against wickedness of
the mind, piety of the soul; against haughtiness, humility; against boasting,
contempt; against the love of honour, subjection; against praise, contumely; [p.
23] against riches, poverty; against possession, want; against enmity, peace;
against hatred, love; against anger, conciliation; against wrath, propitiation;
against envy, love; against evil jealousy, the love of mankind; against cursing,
blessing; against smiting upon the cheek, the turning of the other cheek to him
that smiteth us; against trouble, joy; against suspicion of ourselves, confident
hope towards God; against the passions of the body, the passions of the spirit;
against the sight of the body, the sight of the spirit; against ornament in
dress, the want of attire; against luxury, asceticism; against fatness,
emaciation; against the mind which meditateth upon meats, the mind which
contemplateth heavenly things; against the sight of everything which is visible,
the remembrance of everything which is invisible; against the world which is
present, the quest of the world which is to come; against the love of parents of
the body, the love of parents of the spirit; against the bond of relationship
which is in the human race, the bond of our understanding in our heavenly
kinship; against a city and a <A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A> house
on earth, the dwelling of Jerusalem which is above.</p>
<p>All these things then, and others which are like unto them, are healed by
what is opposite in nature to them, and are made whole by [their] antidotes; and
it is meet that whosoever lusteth after spiritual things should deny [himself]
corporeal things. For until one lust is dead in us another cannot live within
us, that is, until the lust of the body is dead the lust of the spirit cannot
live in our thoughts; for the death of one of them is that which maketh its
fellow come to life. When the body [p. 24] with all its lusts liveth in us the
soul with all its lusts is dead, but when the soul is associated with the life
which is in the spirit, all its members----which are its thoughts----live with
it. Then riseth man from the dead, and liveth in the new life of the new world.
Until we have cast off from us the old man we cannot put on the new man of the
spirit; and even though, by grace, we may put him on yet we do not perceive him.</p>
<p>Now all these sicknesses which we have enumerated can be healed by these
medicines, and it belongeth therefore to the man that is sick to know his
sickness, and to be a physician unto himself, and for each of these sicknesses
which we have enumerated let him apply the medicine which is its antidote. For
behold, by the side of the sickness a drug for healing is laid, and near the
blain is the medicine which will cure it. If thou wouldst seek to heal thy
sicknesses, behold the medicines for their cure are by their side; but [first]
understand thy diseases and acquire the knowledge of the drugs which have the
power to heal them. And from the slight indication which I have described for
thee <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A> thou must understand that [all]
the rest belongeth to thine own care; for instruction doth not teach thee
everything lest thou become sleepy and useless. Now if these things which have
been or which are about to be written are thought by thee to be more difficult
than thy strength [is able to bear], cry unto God for help, and from Him thou
shalt obtain grace which will assist thee in the war in which thou standest.</p>
<p>We will then draw nigh, by the help of God, and in few [p. 25] words we will
write concerning each of these passions so far as power [lieth] in us----that is
according as grace shall sustain [us]----for our own benefit and for the profit
of others. And we will set these matters in order, one after the other, and we
will show where it is meet that the disciple should begin, and how he should
advance and ascend all the grades of the Christian life and conduct, until he
arriveth at the topmost step of love, from whence he shall ascend to the grade
of perfection. Then will the spiritual land of the joy of Christ receive him,
and when he hath stood upon it he will be free from passions, and will be
delivered from lusts, and he will have subdued all his enemies under his feet,
and that man will speak with boldness the word of the Apostle, saying, &quot;Yet
I live; [and yet] no longer I, but Christ liveth in me&quot;:<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
to Whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>
