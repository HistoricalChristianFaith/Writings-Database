PREFACE.
</h3>
<P>
The present volume contains an English translation of the complete Syriac text of the Discourses of Philoxenus upon Christian Life and Character which was published early this year as Volume I of this work.
</P>
<P>
Among the Nitrian collection of Syriac MSS. in the British Museum, there are preserved some nineteen volumes which contain the Discourses or extracts from them, and they range in date from the early part of the VIth to the XIIIth century. Nine of these volumes have no critical value for the text, as they contain short passages only. Of the remaining ten one (the MS. C) belongs to the VIth century; two (the MSS. D and E) belong to the VIth or VIIth century; one (the MS. A) belongs to the VIIth or VIIIth century; one to the VIIIth or IXth century; three (the MSS. B, G and H) belong to the IXth century; and two to the Xth century; from eight of these the published text has been taken. When I first copied the Discourses in
1883-4 I selected the text in A as a base, because, though written by two hands, it contained the whole
<A NAME="pviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|viii</SPAN></A>
of the thirteen Discourses complete;  with this MS. B agrees  closely.    In  a conversation which  I had with the late Prof. Wright in 1888  on the matter, he advised that the older MSS. C and D should be taken as  first  authorities,   and  in  deference   to  his  mature opinion I in many cases substituted readings from them in the place of those which I found in A and B.    It became apparent, however, when I came to print the work that the more correct readings were often found in A and B.   Indeed each of the MSS. frequently made the same mistake,  although in different places.    Some of the readings of B and C I again  relegated to  the notes, and finally decided to print the text as it stood in my original copy.    As a result of these changes it will be seen that, in some cases,  the better readings are given in the notes  and the less good in the text. To the English reader this will offer no difficulty, for throughout my translation I have  followed what I believe to be the  correct reading.    The Syriac scholar on his part will, of course, choose his own text.   I have in no way attempted to emend the text which in places I believe  to have  suffered  through  the  unintentional mistakes   of weary  scribes,   but  have,   to  the best of my power, reproduced  it as I found  it in the various MSS.   With a view of shewing how little change the text has undergone in passing from copyist to copyist
<A NAME="pix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ix</SPAN></A>
during the course of nearly four centuries I have added the variant readings from the MSS. E, H, G, and F. of the VIth, VIIth, IXth and Xth centuries respectively. A list of the <I>Errata, </I>almost unavoidable in a printed text of such a length, is given on p. clxxxviii f. Some of these I owe to the kindness of Prof. Rubens Duval of Paris, and I beg the reader to make the necessary corrections before he uses the book.
</P>
<P>
The translation has been made as literal as possible, and all words added have been indicated by brackets. A list of the passages in the Bible either quoted or referred to in the Discourses has been given on p. clxvii ff. A comparison of the quotations with existing Syriac versions of the Bible seems to shew that Philoxenus was perfectly acquainted with the Syriac text, but that he, in many cases, quoted from memory. The version used by him was the Pesh&icirc;tt&acirc;, which he quoted loosely, or with such modifications as his argument required or his fancy dictated. Books like the Psalms which we know were learned by heart in Syrian schools and colleges he generally quotes accurately, but at times his ostensible quotations (introduced by
mL) are scarcely recognizable, at others he confuses two or more distinct passages, at others he gives the general sense, and at others a mere paraphrase. Every one of his quotations which differs from extant versions is of
<A NAME="px"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|x</SPAN></A> interest, and that the reader may be able easily to judge of the variations from the P&euml;sh&icirc;tt&acirc; I have drawn up a list of the more important typical quotations and given them above their equivalents in that text on pp. cxxxviii-clxvi. From about the year 481 to 519 the name of Philoxenus was, according to his theological opponents, in the dioceses of Western Asia synonymous with turmoil and strife. The Bishops and Patriarchs who leaned secretly towards Nestorian doctrines regarded him with terror and feared him as one of the ablest, most energetic and eloquent opponents of those who maintained two natures in our Lord's Person. For a period of nearly forty years he waged unflinching war against this doctrine, and amidst persecutions in Antioch, Apamea, and Constantinople maintained his views both by word of mouth and in writing, and produced a series of works, the like of which exist not in the Syriac literature of the Monophysite Church. His expulsion from the diocese by Calandio and the threats of the greatest ecclesiastics of the time neither silenced him nor stayed his hand; and at length he proved the sincerity of the conviction of the truth of his doctrine by suffering martyrdom in the second year of Jovian, A.D. 519. Hitherto his doctrine has been represented chiefly by the accounts thereof written by his theological opponents, but in the Introduction to this volume are
<A NAME="pxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xi</SPAN></A>
given for the first time, I believe, in the language in which he wrote them his professions of faith and a brief list of the points on which he differed from the Nestorians and his other adversaries. I had hoped to have supplemented these by a number of extracts from his great work on the Incarnation and how &quot;One Person &quot;of the Trinity became man and suffered for us&quot;, but as the space at my disposal was insufficient it has been found necessary to omit them.
</P>
<P>
Until the early part of this year the writings of Philoxenus were only known by the extracts from them given by Assem&acirc;n&icirc; in the second volume of his splendid <I>Bibliotheca Orientalis, </I>by the letter to Abu Naf&icirc;r of al-H&icirc;rah, published by the Abb&eacute; Martin, by the letter to the monks of Tell-'Add&acirc;, published by Professor Guidi, by the letter to the priests Abraham and Orestes of Edessa regarding Stephen bar S&ucirc;dh-ail&ecirc;, published by Mr. Frothingham, and by the necessarily very brief quotations given by Dean Payne Smith in his <I>Thesuurus Syriacus</I>;<I> </I>so recently as 1887 Professor Wright was compelled to say concerning Philoxenus, &quot;Unfortunately scarcely any of his numerous works have as yet been printed&quot;.<SUP><A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> </SUP>The estimation in which his works were held in the Monophysite Church will be seen from the quotations from
<A NAME="pxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xii</SPAN></A>
the works of its famous scholars given on pp. xxv-xxvii, and among the opinions of occidental  scholars on his writings  may   be  mentioned   those  of Assem&acirc;n&icirc;  and Wright,  the  former  of whom  said,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>   &quot;scripsit Syriace, si quis alius,  elegantissime,  atque adeo inter optimos hujusce linguae scriptores a Jacobo Edesseno collocari meruit&quot;,  and  the  latter,   &quot;he  was  a scholar  and  an elegant writer&quot;.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>   Since the publication of the Discourses upon Christian Life and Character these opinions have been confirmed by N&ouml;ldeke, who thinks that &quot;Der Ruf des Philoxenus  als  eines Meisters des syrischen Stils wird durch dieses Buch noch in weit h&ouml;herem Grade gerechtfertigt als selbst durch den von Guidi herausgegebenen   Brief an   die  M&ouml;nche   von Tel'ed&acirc;.    Er beherrscht   die   Sprache   mit   vollkommener  Freiheit. Liebensw&uuml;rdiger ist Aphraates, aber zur Grundlage f&uuml;r eine syrische Syntax eignet sich sein Werk mindestens so gut wie die Homilien dieses Mannes&quot;.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>   In a private communication
<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> Professor Guidi of Rome writes,   &quot;Lei confesso che non sarei alieno dal riconoscere nei Discorsi di Filosseno da lei publicati, la <I>piu bella prosa siriaca, </I>nella quale all' eleganza finissima della lingua &egrave; unita l'energia e la forza dello stile.    La sua publicazione  &egrave; di  grande  utilit&agrave;   ed  importanza  anche al
<A NAME="pxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiii</SPAN></A>
semplice punto di vista filologica, per lo studio della lingua e della sintassi siriaca, nel periodo classico&quot;. In a recent notice Prof. Rubens Duval says, &quot;Philox&egrave;ne appartient &agrave; l'&eacute;poque la plus brillante de la litt&eacute;rature syriaque. Son style est &eacute;l&eacute;gant sans recherche, ses p&eacute;riodes courtes mais harmonieuses. Jacques d'&Eacute;desse le tenait pour un &eacute;crivain de premier ordre. Ass&eacute;mani, qui d&eacute;teste les doctrines h&eacute;r&eacute;tiques de Philox&egrave;ne, partage l'admiration de l'&eacute;v&ecirc;que d'&Eacute;desse pour son talent litt&eacute;raire&quot;.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>

<P>
It is now my pleasing duty to thank the Council of the Royal Society of Literature of the United Kingdom for undertaking the publication of this work, which they have issued in a form worthy of their high reputation; their munificence has brought into the light the greatest work of one of the greatest Syrian writers, and lays all Syriac scholars under an obligation. A word of thanks too is due to Mr. Drugulin and to Dr. Chamizer his manager for the care which they have taken in the typographical portion of the work.
