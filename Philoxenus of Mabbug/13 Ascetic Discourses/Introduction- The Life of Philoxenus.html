<h3 align="center">----</h3>
<h3 align="center">THE LIFE OF PHILOXENUS.</h3>
<p>Akhs&eacute;n&acirc;y&acirc;, later named Philoxenus, was born in the third quarter of the
Vth century at a village called Tahal<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, which was
situated in Beth Garmai, probably on the confines of Persia<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>;
of his parents and their rank and condition we know nothing, but as he was
baptized it may be assumed that they were Christians or, at any rate, that they
had leanings towards Christianity. His brother Addai is mentioned together with
him by Simon of B&ecirc;th Arsh&acirc;m<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>, who says that they
opposed Ibas <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> at Edessa. Making his way westwards
Philoxenus came to Edessa, probably in his early manhood, where he studied <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
at the time when Ibas was engaged in translating the works of those who held <A NAME="pxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xviii</SPAN></A>
the Nestorian doctrines into Syriac <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. Of the
history of his life at this period we know nothing, but it seems to have been
imprudent to send a young man of his ardent and religious temperament into a
city which, though the chief seat of ecclesiastical learning in that part of the
country, was at the same time a source of the religious polemics of the time,
for there is little doubt that at a comparatively early age Philoxenus was
already known as a willing and zealous teacher and disputant. Such a man was no
doubt of great value to the Monophysite Church when the doctrines of Nestorius,
which were gaining ground on all sides, were to be fought against, but his
ability soon brought him into unenviable notoriety, and between the years 481
and 485 he was expelled from the diocese of Antioch by Calandio <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
the Patriarch as a preacher of the views of Cyril of Alexandria and an advocate
of the Henoticon of Zeno. The views of Philoxenus were, however, identical with
those of Peter the Fuller <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>, by whom immediately
after the banishment of Calandio in 485, he was ordained Bishop of Mabb&ocirc;gh <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
or Hierapolis <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>. In an anonymous life of
Philoxenus from which Assem&acirc;n&icirc; gives extracts in his <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis
</i>(ii. p. 13), it is said that &quot;Philoxenus, being abundantly learned in
all the doctrine of the Syrians, <A NAME="pxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xix</SPAN></A>
and having received the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, became Bishop of Mabb&ocirc;gh
in the year [of the Greeks] 800, in the time of Zeno, that is to say 488 years
after the coming of our Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>The writer of this statement has made a mistake, for several circumstances
show that Philoxenus was recalled from exile by Peter the Fuller in 485, and
that he was ordained bishop in the same year, and it is said that his name was
then changed from Akhs&euml;n&acirc;y&acirc; to Philoxenus <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>Soon after Philoxenus had become Bishop of Mabb&ocirc;gh some Persian bishops
visited his city, and in the new bishop they are said to have recognized a slave
who had fled from his master, and a man who had never been baptized; this
statement is made both by Theodore the Reader <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
and by Theophanes <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>, and most writers upon the
much-abused Philoxenus have gravely repeated <A NAME="pxx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xx</SPAN></A>
it <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>. The narrative of the scandal goes on to say
that the Persian bishops made representations as to the impropriety of a man
with such antecedents being Bishop of Mabb&ocirc;gh to Peter the Fuller, who answered
that the service of ordination was sufficient to take the place of baptism <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>,
and he took no further steps in the matter. Whether Philoxenus was actually a
slave, or only the son of a family who paid tribute to the Persian nobility or
landed proprietors, is a matter of no consequence, but it can be proved from his
own writings that he was baptized, and that he regarded baptism as a thing of no
small importance. Thus in his treatise on the Incarnation of Christ he says:
---- &quot;Now we will keep and preserve always the sign of belief and the seal
of baptism and we will not destroy either by any manner of means,&quot; [Syriac]
<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>. And in his letter to Zeno he says: ----
&quot;The only begotten Son was One of the Trinity, even as His words to His
disciples testify, Go ye forth and convert all nations and baptize them in the
name of the Father, <A NAME="pxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxi</SPAN></A> and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. For I was baptized in the name of Him that died, and
I confess that He in Whose name I was baptized died for me, and I believe that I
have put on in baptism Him in Whose name and in Whose death I was
baptized&quot;: [Syriac]. The report that Philoxenus was unbaptized is thus
shown to be without foundation.</p>
<p>Of the period of the life of Philoxenus which immediately followed his
ordination we know nothing, but we may be certain that he ceased not to preach
and to teach the doctrines which were approved by Peter the Fuller, and it is
possible that during the first thirteen years of his episcopate he wrote parts
or all of many of the works which have made his name so famous among Monophysite
writers. In the year of the Greeks 809 (A. D. 497-8) we learn from Joshua the
Stylite that Philoxenus was present at Edessa during the celebration of some
heathen festival. For seven clays before the appointed day arrived the people of
Edessa went up to the theatre each evening in crowds; they were dressed in
gorgeous apparel, and they burned incense, and danced through the whole of each
night. In consequence of these things no man went to prayer, and the people
became bolder and wickeder, for there was none in the city to rebuke them, and
Joshua complains that, &quot;although Xenaias, the Bishop of Mabb&ocirc;gh, was in
Edessa at the time, ---- of whom beyond all <A NAME="pxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxii</SPAN></A>
others it was thought that he had taken upon him to labour in teaching,----yet
he did not speak with them on this subject more than one day.&quot; <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></p>
<p>In the year 498 Flavian II. ascended the episcopal throne of Antioch, and by
suddenly declaring himself to be in favour of the decisions arrived at by the
Council of Chalcedon----now hitherto he had denounced them----he made Philoxenus
a bitter and implacable enemy who gave him no rest until he succeeded in
effecting his deposition in 512. The first step taken by Philoxenus was to
denounce Flavian II. for secretly holding Nestorian doctrines, and when Flavian
anathematized Nestorius and all his works, Philoxenus turned his attention to
Dioscorus and Theodore, Theo-doret, Ibas, Cyrus, Eleutherius, and John, some of
whom held the views of Nestorius, but the others having been accused of
favouring him secretly had anathematized him, and he next insisted that unless
Flavian anathematized all these he would hold him to be a Nestorian,
notwithstanding his denial and anathema of Nestorius. He also tried to make the
friends of Dioscorus and Eutyches unite with him against Flavian, and being
joined by Eleusinus, a bishop of Cappadocia Secunda, and by Nicias of Laodicea
in Syria, he succeeded in making him anathematize in writing Dioscorus and all
who held views similar to his; this document Philoxenus sent at once to the
Emperor Anastasius, whom he had been able to imbue with a belief in the
Nestorianising tendencies of Flavian. This took place A. D. 507, and as a result
Philoxenus was summoned to Constantinople by the Emperor, and the <A NAME="pxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxiii</SPAN></A>
Church in that city was much disturbed at his arrival <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>.
In response to the wish of Anastasius Flavian modified his views, and with the
help of some of his clergy, attempted to set them forth in a writing, which he
sent to the Emperor. With this, however, Philoxenus was still dissatisfied, and
he further insisted that Flavian should anathematize both the Council of
Chalcedon and those who maintained two natures in our Lord's Person; but this
Flavian declined to do, and was, in consequence, denounced afresh to the Emperor
as a Nestorian. Shortly afterwards Flavian admitted publicly that although he
approved of the Council of Chalcedon for deposing Nestorius and Eutyches, he did
not consider its definitions of faith satisfactory. In answer to this statement
Philoxenus, having persuaded the Bishops of Isauria to join him, drew up a creed
in which they anathematized all who maintained two natures in our Lord's Person,
and submitted it for signature to Flavian and to Macedonius of Constantinople;
these prelates refused to sign the document and were in consequence
excommunicated. In 512 a Council of eighty bishops met at Sidon by the Emperor's
command to define the true faith ; the presidents were Philoxenus and Soterichus
of Caesarea, both of whom yearned for the downfall of Flavian and of his friend
and ally Elias, Bishop of <A NAME="pxxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxiv</SPAN></A>
Jerusalem. The behaviour of the two parties was such that Anastasius dismissed
the Council without recording his decision on the matters under dispute, and for
a breathing space the opponents of Philoxenus had the advantage; but since it
subsequently transpired that both Flavian and Elias had acted with duplicity the
imperial protection was finally withdrawn from the former prelate and he was at
once deposed and banished to Petra, and the famous Monophysite teacher Severus
was appointed Patriarch of Antioch in his stead. Before this took place,
however, the monks of the district of Cynegica in Syria, and those of the whole
of Syria Prima had been stirred up or bribed by Philoxenus, and they rushed into
the city of Antioch in a body, with great noise and tumult, and endeavoured to
make Flavian anathematize the Council of Chalcedon and the document of Leo; but
the people of the city rose in arms against them, and slew many of them, and
cast their bodies into the Orontes <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>. Evagrius'
description of the behaviour of Philoxenus on this occasion does not place him
in a favourable light, but though admitting that zeal for his opinions would, no
doubt, lead him to overstep all bounds to secure their acceptance in the Church,
it is probable that we must make some allowance for the hostility of those to
whose lot it has fallen to describe his life <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>Flavian being removed from his seat Philoxenus <A NAME="pxxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxv</SPAN></A>
seems to have rested content and to have devoted himself to writing his works
and letters, the main object of which was to promote the Monophysite doctrines,
until the year 518, when the orthodox Emperor Justin ascended the throne ; soon
after this event the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon were ratified by
imperial command, and all the bishops who had been banished by Anastasius were
restored to their sees. In the following year some fifty-four bishops who
refused to accept the decrees of Chalcedon were banished, and among them were
Severus of Antioch, Peter of Apamea, John of Telia and Philoxenus of Mabb&ocirc;gh <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>.
The Edessene Chronicle <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> says: ---- &quot;In the
second year of the reign of Justin, that is the eight hundred and thirtieth year
[of the Greeks,=A. D. 518-519] he expelled Severus from Antioch, and Akhs&eacute;n&acirc;y&acirc;
from Mabb&ocirc;gh, and all those who would not accept the four Synods&quot; [Syriac].</p>
<p>From a letter which Philoxenus wrote <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> to the
monks of the monastery of Senun near Edessa in 522 we learn that his first place
of banishment was Philippopolis in Thrace; in the following year he was
&quot;sent into exile in Gangra [in Paphlagonia], and they shut him up in a room
over the kitchen of a public inn, <A NAME="pxxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxvi</SPAN></A>
and there he was suffocated by smoke&quot;: [Syriac] <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>In a life of Philoxenus quoted by Assem&acirc;n&icirc; the account of the manner in
which he was murdered is more fully detailed, and the writer says: ----
&quot;And having filled the Church with divine doctrines, and expounded the
Scriptures, and laid open to disgrace the faith of the Nestorians by means of
his writings against them, they cast him forth into exile in the city of Gangra,
and they suffocated him with smoke. Now they shut him up in an upper chamber,
and made smoke in the room below it, and they shut the doors: in this way was he
crowned, and he was suffocated by them in the true faith&quot;:<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
[Syriac]. Thus ended the life of this remarkable man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is evident from the few facts known concerning the life of Philoxenus that
he was &quot;energetic and fiery&quot; <sup><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> </sup>in
disposition, and a merciless and relentless opponent of all such as differed
from him in their opinions on the natures of Christ; but the hatred of him as a
man and the misrepresentation of his views which are found reflected in the
writings of his biographers ---- who are generally his enemies ---- show that a
final decision as to his behaviour and character cannot be arrived at <A NAME="pxxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxvii</SPAN></A>
until the case is stated from the point of view of Philoxenus. Theophanes
describes him as an unbaptized and runaway slave who pretended to be a cleric <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>,
and in another place he calls him the &quot;impious Xenaias&quot; <A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>;
and both Theophanes and Cedrenus speak of him as the &quot;servant of
Satan&quot; <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>, and accuse him of holding the
opinions of Manes <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>. Evagrius, punning on the name
Xenaias, says that he was &quot;truly a stranger to God&quot; <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>;
the just Tillemont accuses him of &quot;corrupting the faith&quot; <A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>;
and Assem&acirc;n&icirc; says that &quot;he would have wasted the Church of God like a
wild boar&quot; <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>. But if he made his opponents
suffer he did not escape tribulation himself, and this we learn from a letter of
his to the monks of the monastery of S&euml;n&ucirc;n wherein he says :----&quot;What
things I suffered from Flavian and Macedonius, who were archbishops in Antioch
and Constantinople, and before them from Calandion, are known and spoken of in
every place. But I keep silence concerning the things which were prepared to
injure me in the time of the Persian war by the nobles through the care of him
that is called Flavian the heretic, and also concerning the things which
happened to me in Edessa, and in the country of the Apameans, and in that of the
people of Antioch when I was in the monastery of Mar Bassus, and also <A NAME="pxxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxviii</SPAN></A>
in Antioch itself. And when I went up to Constantinople on two occasions the
like things were done unto me by the Nestorian heretics&quot;: [Syriac] <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>.
Before we pass from the subject of the accusation brought against him by his
theological opponents, it must be mentioned that he was charged with being the
author of the heresy of the breakers of the images of saints and angels, and it
is asserted that as he would not venture to destroy those of Christ he hid them <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>.
Whatever may be the faults of Philoxenus all the known facts of his life, and
the whole series of his writings from first to last testify to a tenacity of
will, and a steadfastness of purpose, and a fixity of belief, and an energy in
word and deed which were exceedingly rare in the troubled times in which he
lived. And when we consider the multitudinous affairs in which he was engaged,
and the unflinching strife which he urged against <A NAME="pxxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxix</SPAN></A>
Flavian between the years 498 and 512, and the labour of his first journey to
Constantinople in 507, it seems little short of marvellous that he should have
been able to find time to make a new translation of the four Gbspels from Greek
into Syriac; this work, however, he effected, and his translation appeared at
Mabb&ocirc;gh in the year 508&nbsp; <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>When we turn from the accounts of Theophanes, Cedrenus, Theodore Lector and
others to the doctors of his own creed, we find that Philoxenus was esteemed by
them a very learned man, and that his works were held in veneration by the
greatest authors of the Monophysite Church. If we examine some ten <sup><A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
</sup>MSS. in the British Museum only we see from the statements of the authors
of the works contained in them that the authority of Philoxenus, on matters of
doctrine, is considered equal to that of Severus of Antioch, Isaac of Antioch,
Cyril of Alexandria, Chrysostom, Ephraim the Syrian, <i>etc., </i>and Brit. Mus.
MS. Rich, No. 7183, fol. 124, mentions the name of Philoxenus together with the
names of Ephraim the Syrian, Jacob of Edessa, and Isaac [of Antioch] as writers
from whose works it was necessary to cull Syriac words and expressions. The
famous Dionysius bar-Sal&icirc;bh&icirc; <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>, whom Wright
calls the star among the Jacobites of the Xllth century <A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>,
<A NAME="pxxx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxx</SPAN></A> and who was himself a famous
writer, says in the title to one of his commentaries that he gives in his work
the opinions of the &quot;true and orthodox doctors and &quot;holy fathers like
Severus the Great, and Hippolytus &quot;of Rome, and Epiphanius of Cyprus, and
Philoxenus &quot;of Mabb&ocirc;gh, and Melitus, and Evagrius, and Moses &quot;bar-K&ecirc;ph&acirc;,
and Jacob of Edessa, and John of Con-&quot;stantinople, and John of D&acirc;r&acirc;, and
Mar Ephraim&quot; <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>. But the final seal of
approval is set upon the works of Philoxenus by Abu'l-Faraj Gregory, better
known as Bar-Hebraeus, &quot;one of the most learned and versatile &quot;men
that Syria ever produced&quot; <A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>, who thus speaks:
&quot;And Peter [the Fuller] appointed Saint Philoxenus to &quot;Mabb&ocirc;gh, a
most eloquent man, and a marvellous &quot;teacher, who mightily routed those who
maintained &quot;two natures [in Christ]; and he set forth healthy
&quot;doctrines concerning the holy path of the monastic &quot;life. And he
composed some discourses on the holy &quot;festivals, and works of admonition of
all kinds&quot; <A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>. The same writer mentions the
Mabb&ocirc;gh translation of the Bible, which Philoxenus finished in 508, and the <A NAME="pxxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxi</SPAN></A>
revision of parts thereof by Thomas of Harkel, and with this tacit admission of
the value of perhaps the greatest of all his works by the greatest doctor of his
Church we take leave of Philoxenus <A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>.</p>
