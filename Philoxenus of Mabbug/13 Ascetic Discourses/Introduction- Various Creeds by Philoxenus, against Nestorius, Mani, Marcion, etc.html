THE CREED OF PHILOXENUS.</b>
</P>
<P><i>
Apart from the evidence which may be derived from the great work of Philoxenus upon the subject of how &quot;one Person of the Holy Trinity became
incarnate and suffered for us&quot;----a work which supplies us with the reasons for the faith which he held, we are able to form a tolerably exact opinion of what he believed in respect of the Trinity from two short but remarkable tracts of which copies have come down to us; in the first he states definitely what reply a man is to make when questioned concerning his belief
<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, and in the second he anathematizes the Council of Chalcedon and the creed promulgated thereby
<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.&nbsp;</i>
</P>
<P><i> The first document reads: ----</i>
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<u><a name="REPLY TO BE MADE BY A MAN WHEN QUESTIONED AS TO HIS BELIEF"></a>REPLY
TO BE MADE BY A MAN WHEN QUESTIONED AS TO HIS BELIEF (Brit. Mus. MS. Add.
14,529, fol. 69b)</u>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
I believe in a Trinity, a Trinity which can neither be reduced nor diminished to Two [Persons], nor added
unto so that it becometh Four [Persons]. Nothing from the fulness thereof can be diminished, neither can it
receive any other person from without. Everything which is outside this Trinity hath been created, but
whatsoever is contained therein hath been from everlasting. And it is adorable; nothing outside of it is
to be worshipped, and within it there is nothing which <A NAME="pxxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxii</SPAN></A>
worshippeth. Outside of it there is no other God at all, neither inside of it is there a man that hath been
made. It diminisheth not in its Person, neither doth it add thereunto. In it, which hath existed for ever,
there never began [to exist] a Person, and there doth not pass away therefrom a Person who hath come
to an end.
</P>
<P>Now therefore, one of the Persons of this Trinity came down by the mystery of depletion, and of the
Holy Virgin became man. Inasmuch as He was God, His nature was not changed in its being, and no
addition to His Person took place, but He remained the Only-begotten, even after He had taken upon
himself a body. For the act of coming into being did not introduce into the Only-begotten another first-born, but shewed that the firstborn of the Virgin was
the Only-begotten of the Father; for He, Who was the Only-begotten through His birth from the Eternal,
Himself became the firstborn by His birth of the Virgin, And since God the Word, Who is of the
Virgin, is the Only-begotten, and since because He became man of the Virgin He is the firstborn, the
Only-begotten is the firstborn, and the firstborn is the Only-begotten. And being Himself God, He is Son
of God [and] Son of man; and Son of man [and Son of] God; Son of the Eternal [and] Son of the Virgin;
Son of the Virgin [and] Son of the Eternal; the concealed revealed, and the revealed concealed; a
spiritual corporeal Being, and a corporeal spiritual Being; a finite infinity; Who was upon the throne and
was in the womb; Who was in the womb and was upon the throne; Son of God Son of man; Son of
man Son of God; the visible invisible; the concealed <A NAME="pxxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxiii</SPAN></A>
and invisible visible; the passible impassible; the impassible passible ; the dead living, and the living dead ;
Who being in heaven was in Sheol, and Who being in Sheol was in heaven. The Only-begotten is One
Who hath no number among those who belong to heaven or among those who belong to earth, for
the attributes of the Only-begotten belong to the Only-begotten, and not unto various others, as those
who are in error say. For do not exalted things belong to the exalted? and lowly things to the humble?
and divine qualities to God? and human attributes to man? But to the exalted one who hath been abased
belong lowly things; and of the God Who became man we must believe human things; of the hidden
One who became revealed must we believe all contemptible things ; and to the infinite God Who of His
own will became mortal man, and Who yet remained immortal God in His nature, belong suffering and
death. One of the Trinity became the Only-begotten of the Father, the Word God became the Son of
man by the Virgin by taking upon Himself the body of our Nature, the nature of the Word remaining
unchanged, and He Himself, One God, Who was of God, suffered and died for us. And because He
became the Son of Man, and remained [so] in His life and also in His death even as He continued in
His unchanging and eternal Being, He was also man in His Being.

</blockquote>
<P>
I. We  anathematize the Council of Chalcedon <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> <A NAME="pxxxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxiv</SPAN></A>
because it anathematized the true Council <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> of three
hundred and eighteen holy Fathers.&nbsp;
</P>
<P> II. We anathematize the Council of Chalcedon because it hath acted hypocritically, and because it
hath exceeded all men in wickedness----the ancients, those who come next, and those who have
been in these last days; the ancients with Cyril <SUP><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
</SUP>in Ephesus, those who come next with Dioscorus <SUP><A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
</SUP>in Ephesus,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> and those who have been in these last days in
Chalcedon.
</P>
<P>
III. And we anathematize  it also because it testified concerning  itself and said that the canon of the
Fathers commanded that anathema should be laid upon everyone who composed another faith.
</P>
<P>
IV. And we anathematize the Council  of Chalcedon also because it anathematized
Nestorius, although agreeing with him and with his doctrine.
</P>
<P>
V. And we anathematize the Council of Chalcedon also because it received Leo <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
the wicked, of Rome, and because it anathematized Dioscorus the confessor of the orthodox faith, who had anathematized
Leo the wicked,<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> and would not agree with him. <A NAME="pxxxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxv</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
VI. And we anathematize the Council of Chalcedon also because it received Ibas <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
and Theodoret <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> as orthodox.
</P>
<P>
VII. And we anathematize the Council of Chalcedon also because it renewed the wicked tract and
called it the true belief.
</P>
<P>
VIII. And we anathematize the Council of Chalcedon also because it distinguisheth in one Lord Jesus
Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God, natures, and attributes, and functions, and celestial and
terrestrial qualities, and Divine and human <A NAME="pxxxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxvi</SPAN></A>
properties.    And  it  considereth Him [to be]  Two, and it introduceth an idea of Four, and it
worshippeth an ordinary man, and in every particular it findeth Him  to  be a creature,   even  as   do  the
Jews and heathen, and it agreeth with the wicked Nestorius who  is  accursed and  doomed to
perdition.   For all these and for many other similar reasons we have anathematized and we will
[always] anathematize the Council of Chalcedon.&nbsp;
</P>
<P> IX. And it shall be anathematized, and heaven, and earth, and all the Church which hath been redeemed by
the Blood and Resurrection of God shall say X. that there shall be a curse  upon the  Council of
Chalcedon, and upon every one who hath agreed or  agreeth   therewith----except  he   hath   already
repented, or shall repent----for ever, Amen. Now the wicked Council of Chalcedon met in the
days  of the heathen Emperor Marcian,  in the  year seven hundred and sixty-three (A. D. 451).
</P>
<P>
<i>
To those who &quot;divide our Lord&quot; Philoxenus propounded the ten following
questions <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>:----</i>
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<u><a name="AGAINST THOSE WHO DIVIDE OUR LORD"></a>AGAINST THOSE WHO DIVIDE OUR
LORD (Brit. Mus. Ms. Add. 14,597, fol. 105b).</u>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
I. If it be a demonstrable thing that Christ hath two natures,  to which  of them did the Virgin  give
birth?
</P>
<P>
II. If the  Son  Who   was  born   of the  Virgin  was called 'Emmanuel', which of the two natures
carried off that name?
</P>
<P>
III. If two natures be defined in Christ, which of the two did the Magi worship?&nbsp;
<A NAME="pxxxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxvii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
IV. When, the Holy Spirit descended upon Christ in the Jordan which nature received Him?&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
 V. Saint Paul said, 'The weakness of God is stronger than men',  and  if Christ hath two natures what ,
weakness did God acquire?
</P>
<P>
VI. If the Cross  of our Redeemer be the cleansing of our sins, and our redemption from death----that
is, if we ascribe these things to the human nature of Christ----how   can  Isaiah  be  right  in  saying,
'Not a messenger, and not an angel, but the Lord Himself hath redeemed us'?
</P>
<P>
VII. When God said, 'This is My beloved Son', which nature did He indicate as being that upon which
it is right for us to call?
</P>
<P>
VIII. When Christ took Peter, and James, and John up into a mountain and was transfigured before their
eyes, which nature appeared in this glory?
</P>
<P>
 IX. When the only son of the widow died and was taken to burial, which nature of Christ raised
him to life again?
</P>
<P>
X. If He Who was crucified in the days of Pontius Pilate is to be worshipped rightly, not only by us,
but also by the celestial hosts, doth He not receive this worship as God?
</P>
<P><i>
And of his uncompromising opposition to Nestorius and his followers the following brief extracts from a short tract of Philoxenus supply
evidence</i>.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<u><a name="AGAINST EVERY NESTORIAN"></a>AGAINST EVERY NESTORIAN (Brit. Mus. Ms.

</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
I. We should anathematize Nestorius, and his doctrine, and his books, and everything which hath
been composed by him, and every person who hath been or is of his opinions.&nbsp;
<A NAME="pxxxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxviii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
II. We should anathematize the book of the heretics his children, and those who hold the same opinion
as Nestorius and Diodorus <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> who became Bishop of Tarsus. Now Diodorus was originally a Macedonian,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> but when he had embraced the true faith
and had come into the orthodox Church, he fell into the heresy of Paul of Samosata<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>.
</P>
<P>
III. And we  should  anathematize Diodorus who became a disciple of this man, and also Theodoret
who became Bishop of Cyrrhus.
</P>
<P>
IV. We should accept the Henoticon which expelled all the additions and novelties which arose against
the faith of the three hundred and eighteen and of the one hundred and fifty Fathers
<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>.
</P>
<P>
V. We should accept the Twelve Chapters which Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria, wrote against all the
blasphemies of Nestorius, and which are also <A NAME="pxxxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxxix</SPAN></A>
written in the Henoticon; and we should anathematize every one who agreeth with them, and
also every solution of them [written by] the heretics.
</P>
<P>
VI. We  should anathematize   every one who would divide One Christ into two natures.
</P>
<P>
VII. We should not mingle with heretics by any manner of means,   by communion,   or  by  the  desire  for
salutation, or by the gifts which the churches are wont to make to each other, until we have truly
anathematized  by   the  Book   all   their   doctrine, and  all  the   works  which  have  been  made  by
man thereupon <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>.
</P>
<P>
<i>
In another tract </i><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><i>, which is divided into twenty short chapters, Philoxenus summarizes his objections to the Nestorian doctrines, the following being the chief points of dispute:----</i>
</P>
<blockquote>
  <P><u><a name="AGAINST NESTORIUS"></a>AGAINST NESTORIUS (Brit. Mus. MS. Add.
  14, 597, fol. 98b ff).</u>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
I. If God the Word be One, and His Nature [One], and no other God and no other Nature exist,
why when thou comest to the word 'God' dost thou say, 'One God Who hath put on a body'?
and when thou comest to the word 'natures' dost <A NAME="pxl"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xl</SPAN></A>
not say,  'One Nature Who hath put on a body' instead of 'two natures'?
</P>
<P>
II. If God Who  hath  put  on a body  be One,  His Person Who hath put on the body is also One;
and  if the Person  of the Word Who  hath  put on a body be One, the Nature of the Word Who
hath put  on a body must  also be One.   Now if the Nature  of the Word Who  hath  put  on the
body be One, the Word then is not two Natures, but One Nature Who hath put on a body.   If He
is  not  One  Nature Who   hath  put   on a body, neither  is   He One Person Who  hath  put  on a
body; and if He is not One Person of the Word Who hath put on a body, neither is He God the
Word Who hath put on a body.
</P>
<P>
III. If God the Word became man in His own Person, He  also  became  man  in  His  Nature;   and  His
Nature Who became man is One.
</P>
<P>
IV. If His own flesh, [that is] the Word,  is not like unto all [other] created things, but it existeth in
its  own Person,   then  it  must  exist  in  its own Nature; and if in its own Nature, no other natural
thing can  be  reckoned [with] His flesh,  but the Nature  of the Word which  is  incarnate is One.
</P>
<P>
V. If two natures of Christ  exist,  a Divine Nature, and a human  nature,  there should  not  be  one
worship  for both.   For  if the  human  nature be accounted to be outside the Divine Nature, when
thou  worshippest  the  Divine  Nature  thou   dost not worship the human nature,   and if thou dost
not worship it,   it must be another thing,  and if it be  another thing it must  be a created thing.
</P>
<P>
VI. If Christ be two natures then both must be <A NAME="pxli"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xli</SPAN></A>
composite. And if composite, then simple ; and if simple, then incarnate; and if incarnate, then one is in-carnate, and the other simple. What then are they?
</P>
<P>
VII. If the Word,  having become  incarnate,  be  two Natures, the Word having become incarnate must
also  be  two  Persons;   but  if the Person  of the incarnate Word  be  One,  the Nature  of the
incarnate  Word  must  also  be  One,   because  the Person of the Word is not inferior to His Nature,
for as the Nature of the Word is Godhead, even so also is the Person of the Word Godhead.
</P>
<P>
VIII. If there be a Nature Who  hath individual attributes, which  the Person thereof hath not,   or if
there be a Person Who hath individual attributes, which His Nature  hath  not,   then the  attributes
of the  Nature  belong   to  His  Person,   and  the attributes of the Person belong to His Nature.   If
a Person existed Whose attributes did not belong to His nature,  then His Nature could  not exist;
and  again  if a Nature  existed Whose attributes did  not belong to  His Person,  then His Person
could  not exist.   If the   attributes  of the Person belong  to the Nature,  and the attributes  of the
Nature belong  to the Person thereof,  how canst thou say that Christ is two natures?
</P>
<P>
IX. If thou sayest that Christ is two natures, a Divine Nature, and a human Nature, and One Person,
and thou attributest to the Divine Person the attributes of the Divine Nature and the attributes
of the human nature, how canst thou attribute terrestrial and celestial qualities to the Divine
Person and yet put them away from the Divine Nature ? Is the Divine Person inferior to its Divine
<A NAME="pxlii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xlii</SPAN></A> Nature?   And what His Person is is not that also
His Nature?
</P>
<P>
X. And how canst thou expect me to accept that which thou sayest, 'One Person', since thou speakest
also of 'two natures which run with their individual qualities and attributes and operations' ; for if there
be two natures how can there be One Person? Tell me: He must be either Divine or human,
or the two make One Person. The Natures must be perfect or imperfect, and they have either
Persons or they have not. Which nature of the two is without Person? the Divine or the human?
Either one half of the Person worketh each Nature or they have two Persons like two Natures.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
XI. There is not a nature without a Person, neither is there a Person without a nature. For if there
are two natures, then there must also be two Persons and two Sons; for if the Person is One,
then the nature is One, even as the Person is One.
</P>
<P>
XII. Tell me now:  If thou dost attribute to God the Word after His Incarnation a Divine nature and
a human nature, which one is the Person of flesh, and which of Godhead?
</P>
<P>
XIII. Tell me:   Dost thou say that the Word of God, the Son of God, was perfect before the Incarnation of nature and Person, or not?
</P>
<P>
XIV. In the Person which hath two natures, which redeemed,  and  which was redeemed?   Which suffered and which did not suffer?   Which died and
which did not die?
</P>
<P>
XV. Tell me: How canst thou say that the Word after His Incarnation is two natures  and One Person?
Is  it a Divine Person  or  a  human Person?   Or <A NAME="pxliii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xliii</SPAN></A>
is it a Divine and human Person? If the Person be human how is it that the nature of the Word
is without a Person? And if the Person be One, Divine and human, how is that He is not One
Nature, even as He is One Person?&nbsp;
</P>
<P> XVI. When thou confessest two natures and One Person, how can confusion be avoided? Tell me
now: Is this One Person composed of two Natures or of One? If of two, then each nature
constitutes one half of the Person, and if of one then it is either a Divine nature without a Person
or a human Nature. If He be Divine and human, it is One Person, and therefore Divine and
human are One nature. If He be not One nature, then He is not One Person, and if He be not
One Person the matter is answered.
</P>
<P>
XVII. Can a nature exist which hath attributes which attributes do not belong to His Person? or can
a Person exist which hath attributes that do not belong to His nature?   Either the attributes of
the Person belong to His Nature,  or the attributes of His Nature belong to His Person.
</P>
<P>
XVIII. If the Virgin was the God-bearer then He that was born is God.   Who then is He  that was
born of the Virgin, Jesus Christ?   If Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin and the Virgin was the
God-bearer,  then Jesus Christ is God,  and not a man in whom God dwelt.
</P>
<P>XIX. Since  thou confessest that the Holy Virgin  is the God-bearer, and that God was born of the
Virgin,  why dost thou seek to show that Jesus Christ  is not God?   For if Jesus Christ is not
God then the Virgin is not the God-bearer, and <A NAME="pxliv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xliv</SPAN></A>
how canst thou deny and at the same time say that the Virgin is the God-bearer whilst thou
sayest that He that is born of her is man and not God?
</P>
<P>
XX. If she who gave birth be the God-bearer, how can He that was  born  be a man?   But if He
that was born be a man, how can she that gave birth be the God-bearer?   If He that was born
be another,  then the mother must have served unto another, and this is ridiculous.&nbsp;
</P>
<P><i> The writings  of Philoxenus  against  the  Nestorian creed do not, however,  indicate in any way the utter abomination with which he regarded the beliefs of many other sects and their leaders who lived about his own time, and although a thorough supporter of the
Monophysite  doctrine  would  have  no  difficulty  in scenting heresy, however carefully concealed, and wherever found, there were certainly  many weak-kneed brethren who could be easily led out of the path which  the zealous Philoxenus would have them tread.   For the guidance of these and of newly made converts, he found it necessary to draw up a short statement of the principal tenets of the most famous heretics,&nbsp;
and by good fortune a copy of this most interesting document has been preserved  unto   our  times.    As  in  the  case  of many other tracts of Philoxenus which are extant in a single MS. only,   and  which  were  copied  a century  or  two after their author's death, the text,  in all places, does not appear to be free from corruptions; but as to the general meaning of the composition there is no doubt whatever.&nbsp;</i>

And that addition, which took place at Chalcedon, proclaimeth a fourth Person in the Trinity, and it
bringeth in Christ after the Trinity. Now the Jews say, 'This Christ Who came, and Whom the Christians
worship, was a deceiver and a liar, and being a man He made Himself out to be God, that is to say, the
true Christ; and while looking for the lying Christ, that is Antichrist, they will say that He is about to
come.
</P>
<P>
Orthodox Christians, the children of the Holy Church, confess One Nature of the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit. And they believe that one of the Persons of this Trinity----the second Person of the Trinity----Himself came down from heaven, and was incarnate
by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and He took from her a body, but the incarnation made no addition
to His Person, for as it was a Trinity, so it remained, even after one of the Trinity, God the Word, had
become incarnate. And He in very truth was born and was made manifest in the world, and He ate,
and drank, and was aweary, and rested, and tasted sufferings in truth, and He was crucified, and was
buried, and rose on the third day, as it is written. And by the Will of His Father, and by the Will of
the Holy Spirit, He sitteth upon the everlasting throne at the right hand of His Father, and He will come
<A NAME="pxlviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xlviii</SPAN></A> to judge the dead and the living, to Whom, and to
His Holy Spirit be glory, always and for ever and ever, Amen.

<A NAME="#10"></A>10.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP>  Bishop of Edessa, A. D. 435----457.    When still a young man he  began to translate  the  works  of Theodore of
Mop-suestia and of Diodorus into Syriac; compare [Syriac]
(Wright,  <I>Cat. Syr. MSS., </I>p. 644, col. 1 <i>e</i>), and [Syriac]
(Wright,   <I>Cat.  Syr. MSS., </I>p. 107, col. 2, no. 3), and see <I>B. O., </I>i. p. 85.   Because of this and  of his famous letter to M&acirc;r&icirc; the Persian he was accused of supporting the views of
Nestorius;  the Councils of Tyre and B&ecirc;r&ucirc;t acquitted him, but the second Council of Ephesus, which met in 449, condemned him, and being deposed Nonnus was chosen bishop in his stead.  Two years later, however, the Council of Chalcedon reinstated him, and he sat until 457, when he died.    Ibas was the author of a commentary on the Book of Proverbs,   certain metrical homilies,  and a disputation with a heretic, all of which seem to be no longer extant.   See Wright, <I>Syriac Literature, </I>p. 829, col. 2; Duval, <I>Histoire d'&Eacute;desse, </I>Paris, 1892, pp. 174,  175; and

</P>
<P><A NAME="#17"></A>17.&nbsp;<SUP>4</SUP>  He  goes   on  to   explain   that the   Henoticon
( <font face="SPIonic">e(nwtikon</font> ), &quot;that is to say 'Unifier',  is so called because it brought unity &quot;to the holy churches in every place.   And it made the Egyptians   also,   who  had   been   separated   from   the  rest  of the &quot;churches from very ancient times, children of their communion&quot;. The Henoticon  was  the  work of
Acacius,   Patriarch   of Constantinople, and was promulgated by the Emperor Zeno in 482. The Greek text of this composition is given by
Evagrius, <I>Hist. Eccles., </I>iii.  14; for discussions upon it see Gibbon, <I>Decline und Fall,  </I>Chap.
XLVII;  and Milman,   <I>Latin  Christianity, </I>Vol. i. p. 390.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#18"></A>18.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Philoxenus adds, &quot;Now if any man who maketh use of
the art or crafty skill of heretics shall say, It is not right that those who have died whilst holding the office of bishop should
be anathematized, I reply concerning those who are called Diodorus, Theodorus, and Theodoret, If the memorials of these
men be not in their churches, and if their names have been removed from the divine tablets whereon are inscribed the
names of Prophets, and Apostles, and Martyrs, and the orthodox Bishops, and at the head of them all is the holy Virgin
Mary, the God-bearer, why should they not be anathematized by us?&quot; .&nbsp;
