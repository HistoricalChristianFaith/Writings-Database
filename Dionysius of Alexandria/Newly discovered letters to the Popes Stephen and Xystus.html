<p align="center"><i>Newly discovered Letters of Dionysius of Alexandria to the
Popes Stephen and Xystus.</i></p>
<p>DURING the years 254-258 there was a controversy between the see of Rome on
the one hand and the Asiatic and African churches on the other as to the
validity of baptisms administered by heretics. Pope Stephen maintained that
those who had, in an heretical medium, been baptised either in the name of Jesus
Christ alone, or in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, ought, after a
bishop had laid hands on them, to be admitted to communion; whereas Cyprian of
Carthage and Firmilian of Caesarea maintained that heresy on the part of the
baptiser rendered baptism null and void. The pope accused his antagonists of
rebaptising (<font face="SPIonic">a)nabapti/zein</font>),<i> </i>thereby to some
extent begging the question at issue, and excommunicated them both in Asia and
in Africa. In this controversy Dionysius, patriarch of Alexandria, intervened,
and wrote, as Euse-bius relates in the seventh book of his Ecclesiastical
History, one letter to Pope Stephen and as many as three to his successor Xystus
(257-8). Eusebius has also preserved to us brief extracts from the one letter to
Stephen, and from the first and second to Xystus.</p>
<p>In the library of Valarshapat in Russian Armenia is preserved a bulky
refutation of the Tome of Leo and of the decrees of Chalcedon by Timotheus
(called Aelurus), the patriarch of Alexandria. The original was composed by him
in exile at Gangra and Cherson about the year 460, and was translated into
Armenian some time between the years 506 and 544. This version has just been
edited from an old uncial codex which contains it, No. 1945 in the Catalogue of
Karinian, by two of the archimandrites of Etshmiadsin, Dr. Karapet
Ter-Mekerttshian and Dr. Erwand Ter-Minassiantz. The method of Timotheus is to
adduce the Chalcedonian positions, and to confront them first with extracts from
orthodox fathers, especially from the works of his own predecessors in the see
of Alexandria ; and, secondly, with passages from writers declared by his
antagonists (as he assumes) to be heretical, especially Theodoret of Cyrrhus,
Nestorius, Paul of Samosata, and Diodore of Tarsus.</p>
<p>Among the former set of extracts we find one long fragment <A NAME="p112"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|112</SPAN></A>
of Dionysius' letter to Stephen, and two from his first and third letters to
Xystus, of which the following is a literal translation:</p>
<hr width="30%" size="1">
<p align="center"><b>I.&nbsp; <i>Of the blessed Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria,
from the letter to Stephanus, bishop of Rome.</i></b></p>
<p>For as the wisdom [which is] according to the gentiles,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
by changing them into holy persons,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> constitutes
them friends of God and prophets ; so, conversely, the wickedness by transmuting
into unholy persons, manifests them to be <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> enemies
of God and false prophets. What one custom ever included these ? For of a custom
there is in any case a single period [as cause], whereas of caprices all kinds
of ages <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> [are the causes]. And due causes must
always pre-exist before the customs of the gentiles and before human laws. I say
human, however, because God, as alone knowing all things before they come into
being,<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> can naturally also arrive at them by from
the first enacting them as law. Men, however, when they have beforehand
discerned something, and when they have first formed ideas of certain events,
then and not before lay down laws, or make a beginning of customs.<sup><A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
</sup>If then it was from the apostles, as we said above, that this custom took
its beginning, we must adjust ourselves thereto, whatsoever may have been their
reasons and the grounds on which they acted <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> ; to
the end that we too may observe the same in accordance with their practice. For
as to things which were written afterwards and which are until now still found,
they are ignored by us ; and let them be ignored, no matter what they are. How
can these comply with the customs of the ancients ? And in a word I have deemed
certain disquisitions about these matters superfluous ; and I feel that to pay
attention to them is noisy and vain. For as we are told after a first and second
admonition to avoid them,<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> so must we admonish and
converse about them, and after brief inculcation and talk in common we must
desist. On points, however, of prime importance and great weight we must insist.
For if anyone utters any impiety about God, as do those who say he is without
mercy; or if anyone introduces the worship of strange gods, such an one the law
has commanded to stone.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> But we with the vigorous
words of our faith will stone them unless <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> they
approach the mystery of Christ; or [if] anyone alter or destroy [it], or [say]
that he was either not God or not man, or that he did not die or rise again, or
that he is <A NAME="p113"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|113</SPAN></A> not coming again to
judge the quick and the dead ; or <i>if he preach any other gospel than we have
preached, let him be accursed, </i>says Paul.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> But
if anyone despises the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, let such an one
be at once ranked with the dead. For these reasons, that we may be in accord,
church with church and bishop with bishop and elder with elder, let us be
careful in our utterances. Moreover in judging of and dealing with particular
cases,&#8212;as to how it is proper to admit those who come to us from without,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
and how to supervise those who are within,&#8212;we give instructions to the local
primates <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> who under divine imposition of hands
were appointed to discharge these duties ; for they shall give a summary account
to the Lord of whatsoever they do.</p>
<p class="smallish">[This account perfectly accords with what we know from other
sources of this controversy. Pope Stephen, as the tract <i>De Rebaptismate </i>alleges,
appealed to <i>vetustissima consuetudo ac traditio ecclesiastica. </i>Dionysius
meets his appeal by asking how could the orthodox and the heretic have in common
any custom?<i> Qualis una istos circumclusit consuetudo</i>? He argues from Tit.
iii. 10 that heretics should be left severely alone, and affirms that he has
instructed the duly ordained ecclesiastical authorities of his province to treat
those who <i>ad ecclesiam advolant&#8212;</i>to use the phrase of the <i>De
Rebaptismate</i>&#8212;as if they came wholly from the outside or pagan world, that
is to baptise them, and afterwards to watch them carefully.]</p>
<hr width="30%" size="1">
<p align="center"><b>II. <i>Of the same from the first letter to Xystus, chief
bishop of Rome.</i></b></p>
<p>Inasmuch as you have written thus, setting forth the pious legislation, which
we continually read and now have in remembrance&#8212;namely that it shall suffice
only to lay hands on those who shall have made profession in baptism, <i>whether
in pretence or in truth,</i><A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><i> </i>of God
Almighty and of Christ and of the Holy Spirit; but those over whom there has not
been invoked the name either of Father or of Son or of the Holy Spirit, these we
must baptise, but not rebaptise. This is the sure and immovable teaching and
tradition, begun by our Lord after his resurrection from the dead, when he gave
his apostles the command <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> : <i>Go ye, make
disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit. </i>This then was preserved and fulfilled by his
successors, the blessed apostles, and by all the bishops prior to ourselves who
have died in the holy church and shared in its life <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>;
and it has lasted down to us, because it is firmer than the whole world. For, he
said, <i>heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</i><A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<A NAME="p114"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|114</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="30%" size="1">
<p align="center"><b>III. <i>Of the same to the same from the third letter.</i></b></p>
<p>If then our faith urges us to have zeal for God and with our entire heart
love him ; and if we must regard as unclean only those who contemn the really
one and only God, and Creator and Lord of heaven and earth and of all things,
declaring that he is inferior to and less estimable than some other god ; and
they attribute wickedness to the all good, or they do not believe that his
Beloved is our Saviour Jesus Christ, whatever else he be; but breaking up the
marvellous economy and mighty mystery, they believe some of them that he is not
God nor Son of God, but others, that he never became man nor came in the flesh,
but say that he was a phantasm and shadow&#8212;all these John<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
has rightly in his epistle called anti-Christs. Moreover of these the prophet<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
also bore witness, saying: <i>Thy hated ones, O Lord, I have hated, and because
of thine enemies I have wasted away. With perfect hatred I have hated them; they
are become mine enemies. </i>And these are all they that have among us the
appellation of heretics. If however we in the least let them have their way or
side with them, then no longer will the precept to love God with our whole heart
be observed in its entirety, though that it is which it ever profits us to
foster and increase.</p>

concession being made to the heretics whose errors he enumerates, in the way of
recognising their baptisms as valid. F. C. CONYBEARE.]</p>
