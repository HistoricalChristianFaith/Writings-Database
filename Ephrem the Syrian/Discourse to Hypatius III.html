<p>I DESIRE to utter one more refutation against the three of them (<i>i.e., </i>Marcion,
Mani, and Bardaisan), that is against Marcion in the first place who (says) that
a heaven is found also beneath the Stranger. Let us ask who bears up those
heavens, and what is in them. For a power is necessary to bear them. Or can it
be that the heavens of the Stranger are resting on the heavens of the Maker, so
that he is the all-sustaining Maker, as indeed is the case? But if they say that
the heavens of the Stranger hang by the power of the Stranger, we also will deal
[P. 45.] frowardly with the froward, (and say) that he who is above the [Ps.
xviii.26] heavens cannot support the heavens, but (only) if he were beneath
them. But if he is the same person who is above the heavens and below them, it
is clear that the place of his possessions is the same, and in the midst of it
are collected those Souls whom ISU<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> brought up
hence. For a Supporter is required for those heavy Souls whom he brought up
thence . . . [<i>inasmuch as when his possessions are found enfolded within his
bosom there is required for them another power which supports them.</i>] For we
cannot accept from them just as they do not accept from us [L. 26.] that there
should be anything set up without a foundation.</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>But know that if the Stranger has heavens which have been created from
nothing, we must inquire by whom they were<sup> </sup>created. And if they are
his in virtue of (their) 'essential being' there is a fortified boundary of
'essential being' beneath him, which he cannot cross. And just as he is not able
to go forth from that Place which surrounds him so as to be something which does
not exist in a Place, and has no Creator, so he is not able [P. 46.] <A HREF="#lii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lii</SPAN></A>
to cross that boundary which is beneath him. Nor were the Souls able to go up
hence to cross it.</p>

<table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" width="150">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>But if that boundary was capable of being crossed so that also the Stranger
crossed it and came down to us, as they say, and the Souls also rent it asunder
and ascended, as they falsely state, then (it follows that) a boundary which
could be crossed would not be able to prevent the Maker from going up to the
Domain of the Stranger. If, therefore, when he was able to go up he was
unwilling to trample down the boundary of his Companion, he is a God who is
worthy of praise, since even those things which he (<i>i.e., </i>Marcion) has
invented, redound (lit., cry out) to his praise. But if he had the will to go
up, and the Stranger above [L. 39.] allowed him, let them show us why. . . . And
if the Good (Being) was guarding himself, he was verily afraid lest he (<i>i.e.,
</i>the Maker) should injure him. And how did he who was afraid in his own
Domain, come to the Domain of the Maker to struggle with him? And if he guarded
his freedom that there should be no Strife and [P. 47.] Contention between him
and his neighbour, let his Heralds be despised who make him quarrelsome and
contentious. And if they say that the Maker did not perceive the Stranger, it is
unlikely. For how did he not perceive him when he was his neighbour? And if they
say that he was far from him, infinitely far, if it was a mountain immeasurable
and an endless path, and a vast extent without any limit, then how was that
Stranger able to proceed and come down the immeasurable mountain, and (through)
a dead region in which there was no living air, and (across) a bitter waste
which nothing had ever crossed? And if they make the improbable statement that
&quot;the Stranger like a man of war was able to come,&quot; well if <i>he </i>came
as a man of war--[<i>though he did not come</i>], (take the case of) those weak
Souls whom he brought up hence, how were these sickly ones able to travel
through all that region which God their Maker and Creator was not able to
traverse, as they say?</p>

<p>And if they say that these were able but their Maker was not, if they say
anything they like, they must hear something they dislike, (namely), that if the
Soul, which is all the creation of this Creator, was strong enough so that with
the strength of the Stranger, it was able to cross and to go, and did not remain
<A HREF="#liii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|liii</SPAN></A> anywhere (?) on that
immeasurable journey, how much more able [P. 48, l.13.] would the Creator be to
go, not only up to the Domain of the Stranger, but even to explore the other
regions inside of it, if there were any there! . . . [<i>Thou mayest know that
the system of statements which they make is impossible</i>.] For (being) a
Person who grows not old nor ever dies or grows weary, who has no need of a
conveyance of any kind, and requires no food,--and in that Domain there were no
walls to hinder him,--how was the Maker hindered from travelling to see what was
above him, (to see) whether that Domain was empty or had something in it or not?
But if he reached the heavens of the Stranger, even if he did not actually enter
he must have struck them to see what they were or whose they were.</p>

<p>And when the Stranger went forth from his Domain to come hither, it is clear
that he vacated his Domain. For anything which is limited, and in the midst of a
place, when it goes forth from its place, the whole of it goes forth and no part
of it remains in its place. But if half of it goes forth and half [P. 49, l.11.]
remains, or some portion of it, these things prove concerning its nature that it
is divisible. And if again they wish to change their ground, and say a thing
which cannot be, (namely), that when he went forth to come from his Domain, his
Domain was not deprived of him at all, because he is a Fullness which [P. 49,
l.15.] does not lack, and a Greatness which is not lessened, then how was his
Domain full of him, and the Domain which was in the middle full of him--a place
infinite and unlimited? And, moreover, the Domain of the Maker would be full of
him (<i>i.e., </i>of the Stranger), and this creation would be full of him ;
even unto Sheol beneath would his extent reach. If before he went out he was the
sole occupant (lit., fullness) of that Domain wherein he dwelt, and after he
went out that Domain was likewise full[P. 50.] of him as before, it is clear
that he is something which was found to belong to that Domain, and was
(nevertheless) outside. It is necessary that we should inquire whence this
addition arose ; or perhaps some veil was upon his face as upon the face of the
Sun; and when that veil was drawn aside he extended his <A HREF="#liv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|liv</SPAN></A>
rays unto us. And when he gathered himself in and confined himself to his Domain
he filled the whole of the Domain in which he dwelt from of old. And it is
necessary that we should inquire from whence are those causes which arose in
front of him, and impeded the Light; and here his nature is found to fill all
(space), and our place is not found to be foreign to his rays, just as also the
vault of creation is not foreign to the rays of the Sun, even if by means of
other veils it is concealed from us.</p>

<p>But the Sun is one thing and its effulgence is another thing. For the Sun has
substance and a circumference, too, and the eye sets bounds to the Sun, but its
effulgence has no limit and substance. For the eye cannot set bounds to it. And
by this proof it is discovered that the child is greater than its parent, since
the parent is limited and the child that springs from the parent unlimited. But
it <i>(i.e., </i>the effulgence) is not really greater; it really is less than
it, in that it has not substance like it <i>(i.e., </i>the Sun). But because
also the Sun is fire we learn to know it <i>(i.e., </i>the Sun) from this lower
fire; for thus also a flame of fire has a substance, [P. 61, l.28.] but the
Light of the fire has no substance. And bodies come and go in the midst of its
Light and are not injured, but bodies cannot approach very near to the substance
(of the flame). And just as there are flowers or blossoms or one of the roots
which have sweet-smelling fruits and one small place is able to accommodate them
because they are substances, but their scent is diffused outside of them because
it has no localised substance ; and we [P. 52.] do not say that the scent of
spices is more than the spices, or the perfumes of ointments more than the
ointments, for they themselves are sold for a price, but the scent of fragrant
herbs is freely given to all who come near them ; and (just as) the censer
cannot fill the house, but its smoke is greater than the house, for it is even
diffused outside of it, (so) if they have made, therefore, their God like a
perfume, which is dissipated and like a flame which is scattered, though they
wish to honour him, they reduce him to inferiority, for they make him (to be)
without an independent substantial Existence.</p>

<p>Again, let the party of Bardaisan be asked concerning those Entities which he
speaks of, what supports these things of his <A HREF="#lv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lv</SPAN></A>
also,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> seeing that they are placed in a deserted and
empty Space in which there is no breath of air supporting all, especially
inasmuch as he mentions that there are both light and heavy Entities there? For
Light is lighter than Wind and Wind than Fire, just as also Fire is lighter than
Water. But light and heavy things cannot exist unitedly in one enclosure without
the force of another [P. 53.] (supporting them).</p>

<p>For the light (thing) must dwell above just as the heavy (thing) dwells
beneath all. Therefore, Fire cannot exist in the same rank in which Light
exists, nor can Water, which is heavy, be in the rank of Fire, or of Wind,
because there is no force to support them. . . . Water puts an end to Fire,
which is opposite it. For [L. 29.] heaviness and weight cannot exist in one rank
just as they cannot [L. 39.] . . . by the same weight . . . things which are
light and heavy in the midst of Water or in Air. These things convince
concerning themselves how (far) the heavy approach the light. And if these which
are heavier by measure than their companions, do greatly flee towards the
depths, how much more distant from those things [P. 54.] which are beneath,
without weight and without measure, will the Darkness be which exists more
heavily than all! For lo, all its heaviness, too, is beneath all ... [<i>how did
the Darkness</i>]<i> </i>go up from them because its heaviness. . . . But if it
is able to exist [L. 16.] and be quiet, let them tell us what thing it was which
came upon its heaviness (?) . . . for it is unable to be raised by itself. . . .
[Ll. 12, 22.] But if they say that it crossed its boundary and when it crossed
[L. 34.] it, it crossed it in an upward direction, then (let me ask), which is
easier--for a heavy thing to go upwards, which is not natural, or to be sent
downwards according to its nature? For so [L. 46.] . . . [<i>owing to some cause
or other</i>] to cross its boundary and make an Assault upwards. Above all [<i>the
proper nature of its </i>[P. 55.]<i> </i>(i.e., <i>of the Darkness</i>) <i>heaviness,
demands that it</i>] should be continually sent beneath. And because from of old
and from eternity everything was actually going down and down the Fire would not
be able [<i>to find its way down through the great</i> <A HREF="#lvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lvi</SPAN></A>
<i>distance to the Darkness beneath or to reach</i>] the Depths which are
immeasurable.</p>

<p>But let us inquire as to this Fire, what was the cause that stirred it up
also to cross the Boundary which it had never crossed before? They say that the
Wind beat upon it and stirred it up. Let us come to the succession of causes and
let us ask also concerning the Wind,--what stirred it up too? And if the causes
are multiplied, what, then, was that which was the Cause of all the causes? If
it be not known, there is a great error, but if it be known, there is a right
question in reply to which a true argument should be offered. For if it was God,
then He is the cause of all confusion, He who disturbed things in their state of
order and [Cf. p. lxxiii. 1. 15.] mingled things that were pure and introduced
Strife and Contention among Natures that were at peace ; then He Who, they say,
[P. 56.] is the real cause of all beauty turns out to be the cause of all
ugliness.</p>
<p>But whoever stirred up that Evil which was asleep, and gave power to what was
powerless and found out a method and arranged the Cause to make the Evil cross
the Boundary, a thing that had never crossed its Boundary, that misdeed of his
teaches us what name we should give him, with what eye we should look upon him,

<p>But if the same Upper Being stirred the Element of the Wind in a manner
contrary to its nature, then that Upper Being must have crept and come down from
his natural height; and what Cause, then, stirred him up, too, that he should
hurl Contention [Cf. p. lxxiii. l. 15.] and Strife among the Entities and
Natures which were in a peaceful state, and, if they know not, whence did this
cause spring?</p>
<p>For as regards these other things which they say concerning the Entities,
whence did they learn that they are as they say? If the spirit of revelation
made (it) known to them, it ought to [P. 57.] have revealed to them (something)
concerning the Cause on which all the causes depended.</p>

to prevent the dew which dropped upon his bed! But let them give us the signs
and wonders which he did, that by means of the open signs the secrets which he
taught may be believed. But if the Prophets and Apostles [L. 22.] who did many
signs and wonders did not say one of the things which Bardaisan by himself
denied, and if Bardaisan, who denied many things which are foreign to the
teaching of the Prophets and Apostles, did not do any of the signs which they
did, is it not clear and evident to any one who wishes to see clearly that there

is beneath everything and above the Darkness--who supports all these? Or how
does the Darkness, which is beneath [P. 58, l.10.] everything, support
everything so as to be the foundation of all? But if they say that everything is
placed on nothing, let Bardaisan who said how can it be explained that something
comes from nothing, (let him) repeat the thing which went forth from his mouth
(and ask) how can something be supported by nothing? For how can a thing which
does not exist support a thing which does exist? But if he says that it would be
easy for God to hang everything on nothing, he confesses, though unwillingly,
that it would not be difficult for God to create everything out of nothing. For
if he was unable to create something from nothing, neither would he be able to
set something on nothing . . . [<i>and </i>[P. 59.]<i> Bardaisan cannot say that
the Will of God supported everything</i>].<i> </i>For (how) was that Will which
they say is light [<i>and unable to </i>[L.7]<i> make anything from nothing able
even to support it?</i>] And, [L. 13.] therefore, as it was necessary for the
Will to have something out of which to create creatures ([<i>so it needed
something</i>] on which to place its creatures.</p>

myriad of ... each supporting one another . . . [<i>they are not wise in what</i>]
they say ; [<i>for let us </i>[L. 33.] <i>ask about that last supporter</i>] of
them all, who bears it up? Until of necessity one great and perfect One is found
Who is perfect in every respect, Who is identical with His own Domain and exists
by His own power, and from nothing makes everything. For if He lacks any one of
these things, then He is not perfect, and, therefore, [P. 60]. He is in some
sort an imperfect God who requires three things--that is, something from which
to create created things, and a Pillar which upholds His creatures and a Domain
in which His Divinity may dwell. But if the Will of God is supporting by its
power the creatures which come from the Entities, it is clear that also that
Will of God was supporting the Entities from the first and the same confused
them. And if it was not supporting the Entities, then it does not support
anything that comes from them. And if the Entities were dependent on it <i>(i.e.

</table>
<p>And, therefore, on these grounds we have opposed Mani also with a true
refutation. For he, too, calls God the Earth of Light, which (Earth) is not
perfect, but if it is a deficient thing, the very word deficiency is enough to
refute its claim to perfection. For its one side proclaims concerning the whole
if it, that if on its side which is near the Darkness, it is limited by the
Darkness, and if it is (so) by nature, its nature is very deficient and
imperfect, inasmuch as that which limits it on one side is not a thing which is
fair but the Darkness. Now, in the case of a thing which is limited by the Evil,
inquire no further as to its weakness; [P. 61, l.13.] for it is enough that the
Evil limited it. And how, O Mani, shall we call that thing the perfect Good
which is limited by the Darkness, or perfect Light that which is bounded by the
Darkness? For it <i>(i.e., </i>the Darkness) confined and limited its
inferiority <i>(i.e., </i>the inferiority of the Light), and did not suffer it
to fill all (Space), in addition to the fact that it <i>(i.e., </i>the Darkness)
waxed <A HREF="#lix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lix</SPAN></A> bold like a strong one to
trample down its Domain and to enter its Boundaries, and to plunder its
Possessions. But they say that it <i>(i.e., </i>the Darkness) came as one in
need ; but if it was in need, know that this <i>(i.e., </i>the Light) also is
weak, and if the former plunders the latter is plundered. And, in order that
they may be refuted in all points, if the two frontiers of Good and Evil were
thus contiguous, all that side which bordered on the unclean became unclean and
defiled, and infected, and corrupted by the contact of the Darkness. And if they
say that that side which bordered on the Darkness was not injured by the contact
of the [P. 62.] Darkness, then that side which could not be injured is more
excellent than those Souls which were injured by the contact of the Darkness,
for it (<i>i.e., </i>the Darkness) is said to have acquired power over the
inferior, since this inferior was all injured. But although it <i>(i.e., </i>the
side) has contact with the corrupt Darkness from everlasting to everlasting, the
injurious contact could not injure it. And if the Enemy was unable to get
dominion over it, and the Foe to tread it down and the Marauder to ascend and
cross it, then why was it necessary for the Good One to take<sup> </sup>the pure
Souls who belonged to him, and to 'hurl' them beyond his own victorious Frontier
into the jaws of the Darkness? For it has been said that the Darkness could not
even cross that mighty Frontier. But if it was a defenceless Frontier, one which
could be overcome, and laid low, and trodden down and crossed, then its weakness
could also be injured by the contact of the Darkness. And if the Darkness had
been able to get dominion over it, if it had wished to destroy it, lo, it would
have destroyed [P. 63.] it by degrees, and made an Assault. And if it desired to
rob it, behold it would have approached it stealthily by degrees, and moved
onwards. And if (it had wished) to feel a Passion for it and to enjoy it, lo,
what gave it Pleasure was at its side . . . if [L. 13.] what gave it Pleasure
was in close contact on its side from everlasting to everlasting; and if it
carried its will into action, the Darkness had no need to make an Assault and
enter the midst of the Earth of Light, because the same Pleasantness was
diffused throughout the whole of it <i>(i.e., </i>the Earth). For the Light is
one in its nature, and wherever a man has pleasure in it, <A HREF="#lx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lx</SPAN></A>
it is the same. Look, therefore, at the fabricated system of deceit, for in all
this the Pleasantness of the Light is in contact with the Darkness, as they say.
If it is after the fashion of a park, the one side which bordered on the Sons of
the Darkness was entirely akin to the Darkness--for it is with them.&nbsp; And
if the Fragrance of that pleasant thing is sent forth into their nostrils, and
if that Light is diffused upon their eyes, and if the Melodies of that sweet
Player are poured into their ears, how since all this was present with him, did
he smell and perceive as from a far mountain that &quot;there was something
pleasant [P. 64, l.12.] there&quot;? And if from the centre of the Earth (of
Light) or from the inner sides he received the smell of the Pleasantness of
Light, this, too, is against them. For how did it come about that the sweet
smell and effulgence burst forth and entered even there? And how did this

Darkness?</font>] And if he had great foreknowledge, when do the Souls who have
strayed expect to be 'refined,' seeing that 'he who leads them astray' is so
great? For by his knowledge he made them to be without knowledge. But, above
all, they cannot go forth hence, because, howsoever that Good (Being) may
contrive to form ways and means for their departure [P. 65, l. 9.] hence, that
Evil One knows beforehand all the movements and secrets which are planned there
against him ; and that Good (Being) cannot even conceal his secret thoughts from
him. And if he cannot conceal from him the thoughts in his own heart and in his
own Domain, how does he expect to release from under the hand of this mighty One
the Souls who are subject to his authority, [Cf. p. lxxii. l. 3.] especially,
too, if they are stored up in the midst of him and 'swallowed,' as they say? And
if, when they were not swallowed, he contrived to swallow them, now that he has
swallowed them, who is there that can bring them forth from his midst? '(This <A HREF="#lxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxi</SPAN></A>
is a thought) which even Mani himself may have muttered from the midst of the
Darkness when he was swallowed. And in his muttering whose help would be invoke?
(Would he invoke) Him who even in his own Domain is guarding himself from that
which he fears? For he is afraid to come because he knows that if he comes he is
swallowed; but they are ashamed to say that he [P. 66.] can be swallowed. And
how can they conceal it? For behold those Souls which were swallowed up (so as
to be removed) from him make them ashamed. And if they were not swallowed, again
they are all the more ashamed in this point, (namely): Why did that Nature which
cannot be swallowed not contend (?) with the Darkness and swallow all of it?</p>

<p>If the Evil One has foreknowledge from the first, how is it that he sometimes
(?) perceived as if he sometimes knew? And if when he knew he did not feel
desire ; the question is one which resolves itself into two alternatives,
(namely), if he verily made an Assault with his eyes (open?), it is a thing [P.
67.] repugnant to his nature ; but if, though he felt desire, he did not make an
Assault he remained by reason of his self-restraint for a long time in a state
of desire perforce. But these Souls who are from the Good (Being) are put to
shame by his self-restraint, since they are found to be fornicators, and they
run corruptly into all evils. And who caused that false ascetic to offend? Can
it have been that Virgin of the Light about whom they say that she manifested
her beauty to the Archons, so that they were ravished to run after her? But it
is not possible for pure mouths to speak as they do about the things after this
; so that we will not commit them to writing, but we will take refuge in such
discourse as it is possible to use (and argue), that if that Virgin of Light
appeared to him and <A HREF="#lxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxii</SPAN></A> made him
offend by her purity, her folly is seen in this. And in what respect was the
beauty or pleasantness or fragrance of the Virgin of Light different from that
of that Luminous Earth? So that if there is a question of Passion, behold, [P.
68.] as a harlot, she embraces the fornicator. For the borders of both Domains
embrace one another after the manner of bodies. And, because from eternity and
from everlasting they were touching one another, perhaps, also, that Evil one
became weary of the perpetual contact. But if a comparison such as that which
they employ (lit., bring) is applicable to the matter, (namely), that one loves
and another is loved, the experience of debauchees refutes them, (namely), that,

is injured like a lamb; and when these two things are laid at the door of the

<p>But if there are two Domains, and Good and Evil who dwell in them, (now) I
portray these from things external and with simple illustrations in order that
they may be easy for their hearers. For let us suppose that there is a great and
clear and pure river, and fine fish in it, and that there is a bad and filthy
and foul sepulchre, and moles in it. Then let us set the moles which dwell in
the Darkness as the likeness of the Sons of Darkness, and let us place the fine
fish as a fine (?) type of the Sons of the Light and let us suppose that their
Domains are bounded this by that, the water by [P. 73, l. 8.] sepulchral vaults,
and the dry land by wet ground . . . if those fishes [<i>do not</i>] long to go
up to the dry land and to soil themselves in mud and in the burrows<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
of moles ; is it not, therefore, incontestably clear that just as moles dislike
going down to the water, so fishes disdain to go up to the dry land? And they
are made to be neighbours to one another ; and in proportion as their boundaries
approach one another, so much the further are their (natural) wills removed from
one another ; so that there is none of them which desires his neighbour's
domain. <A HREF="#lxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxv</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, therefore, these things which are not Entities, and are not (derived)
from Entities, and were not made from good and evil Natures--since if thou kill
a mole and cast it to the fishes, the fishes will devour it--and if, therefore,
these things which are near to one another in a certain sense are thus far
strangers as regards their abodes and . . . in their nature, and do not dare to
cross their borders, how much more would it be right that Good and Evil should
exist in their Nature and Domains, seeing that they are real Entities and really
strangers to one another, and the reality of their Enmity [P. 74.] is never
lessened! For if it was lessened, that is due to Freedom and not to
Essential-nature, (it is due) to Will and not to Nature; how, therefore, did the
Darkness . . . to cross to the Domain of its opposite, and why?--seeing that
when a mole goes it goes into its own (proper place), and when it ceases (?) <i>(it
goes forth) </i>and smells that it may reach the edge of the water and (then)
returns again to go into its own (proper place). And so, also, a fish, to which
are assigned its depths comes into its own (proper place), and when it ceases
(?) it returns to its depths</p>
<p>Here are correct demonstrations which refute those who have introduced
confused Teaching . . . For it is found that [L. 33.] fishes and moles which
come from Nature [<i>stay in their own</i> <i>natural places</i>] . . .</p>

Father, made an Assault to enter within the boundaries of the Sons of the Light,

'first' (used to describe him)? But if their Father made an Assault, but they
flee, it is found that these blind and dark moles do (in reality) come from the
nature and abode of the Good (World of Light). For, behold, they flee from their
opposite. Nor (even) like these blind <A HREF="#lxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxvi</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p>Again, let us turn and ask the advocates of Error, that is, its Preachers--how
were the Sons of the Light cast into the mouths of the Sons of the Darkness? And
how did the Darkness swallow the Light--a thing which is not natural to it? But
the nature of both is that the Light swallows and the Darkness is swallowed. And
if here (in our world) the [P. 76.] Light swallows the Darkness as experience
shows, but there the Light is swallowed, as the Heretics say, it is clear that
this Darkness which is swallowed here is not akin to that Darkness which
swallows there ; just as also the Light which swallows the Darkness is not akin
to that which is swallowed by the Darkness. And if they strive to make a stand,
again they fall. For one fall is not sufficient for them. For really it is not a
case of falling at all. For this takes place (only) where there has been
standing ; they are always prostrate-- they do not wish to stand.</p>
<p>Again, let them understand (?) that as regards this Light which swallows the
Darkness here with us, and this Darkness which here amongst us is swallowed by
the Light, it it is the nature of that which swallows to swallow, and of that
which is swallowed to disappear. Or has the Creator's own will changed their
natures? And if it is due to (His) Will, where was their (unchangeable) Nature?
If he is one who submitted (?) himself there, and is the Light-God who did not
[P. 77.] aid himself, whose Light was swallowed by the Darkness, how has he
to-day changed the nature of the Darkness that it should be swallowed by the
Light? For they say that he is the Maker. And, if the Darkness changed its
nature, it is unlikely that it would bring itself to the weakness, so that he
who swallowed them is swallowed to-day. Since that true saying demands that
natures essentially fixed cannot be changed; but that Freewill, because He
created it to say <A HREF="#lxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxvii</SPAN></A> everything,
proclaims by name those Entities whose true nature it cannot declare. But,
because those names belong to the Entities, the Entities of the substances (?)
are changed. For if the substances (?) of the Entities had been like the names
of the Entities, and were fixed natures, they could not be changed ; because a
thing which exists in the natural condition of its original Essence, so exists
as it is, and so remains for ever and ever.</p>
<p>But let us inquire about the nature of this Darkness, whether this is natural
to it, (namely), that it should be swallowed by the Light, just as our sight
proves . . . that [P. 78.] it <i>(i.e., </i>the Darkness), too, is swallowed
here so that both here and there it has an essential Nature. For one Entity
cannot be divided into two Entities, even though the Heretics speak absurdities.
And if the nature of the Light around us, as it proves about itself, is such
that it swallows and is not swallowed, and there is no means whereby Light is
swallowed by Darkness, at any time and for all time to come, it is clear . . .
that as it swallows the Darkness here, so it swallows there, and was not
swallowed (by the Darkness).</p>

is from the evil Nature.&quot; nor is the Soul as they say, from a pure Root.
For the eyes of the glorious body clothe themselves with chastity, its ears with
purity, its limbs with glory, its senses with holiness, in its mouth is praise
and on its tongue is thanksgiving, and in its lips is blessing, in its feet is
the habit of visiting the sick, in its hands alms for the needy, in its heart is
true faith, and in its . . . love (?). And that wall was built by God and [<i>He
made it to be</i>]<i> </i>a pure shrine for Him, and a temple . . . for its
architect when . . . in (?) the body . . . he <i>(i.e., </i>Mani) says . . .
that it <i>(i.e., </i>the Body) is from a nature so that it sins . . . it is a
shame to them since it shows that the Body . . . And if they are not [L. 39.]
persuaded to secret sin, they will be persuaded by a devil. How did he(?) force
. . .</p>

<p>Consider again the refined Soul about which they say [P. 87.] that its nature
is from the Good (Being), it shows concerning its nature . . . the Body is . . .
(a nature) which is evil. Also . . . the refined Soul which they say is the
Daughter of the Light puts on that Darkness in its deeds and . . . in its
conduct. . . . And if (it is) from God [<i>how does it revile</i> [L. 23.]<i>
Him</i>?]<i> . . . </i>and if (it is) from [<i>the Holy One, how is it impure</i>]<i>
. </i>. . and if (it is) from . . . behold it puts on ... and if it is from the
Good (Being), how has it become a den and nest of unmixed Evil?</p>

<p>And if all this was pleasant in the midst of Satan, how do they say that some
of these Souls who sin much and do much wickedness, and blaspheme much, and are
guilty of great unbelief are found like dregs in the midst of one whom they call
BOLOS?<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A><i> </i>As they say that &quot;when the fire
dissolves all his interior, there is collected every portion of the Light which
was mixed and mingled among created things, and those Souls [P. 88, l. 3.] who
have done much wickedness are assigned to the realm of the Darkness when he is
tortured.&quot; And if it <i>(i.e., </i>the Light) is a nature which pleases
him, as the beginning of their Teaching says, how is it the cause of his
torment, as the end of their fabricated system says? But that that Luminous
Nature should become at one time his enjoyment, and [<i>that he should like it</i>]
and enjoy it, and that, again it should be assigned to his realm, and that he <i>(i.e.,
</i>the Darkness) should be imprisoned and tortured therein--this may happen in
the cases of changeable Natures which are created out of nothing : according to
the Will of the Creator they can be changed to anything.</p>
<p>For loose dust of the earth is the dwelling of every creeping thing, and
according to its liking it crawls in it and dwells in it. But if any one by
regulation associates two Natures with the Nature, that is to say, so that it
may be moulded with water by the hand of the workman, and receive strength from
fire, then there springs from it a vessel and a prison-house to torture . . .
that creeping thing which lay in it when it was dust, and crawled in it, and was
delighted when it was [P. 89.] clay. When it becomes a vessel moulded and baked
in an oven, it becomes the torturer of those that are imprisoned in it.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the Darkness is finally tormented by that Luminous Nature in
which it takes pleasure, what was the cause of the negligence long ago (which
brought it about) that the Darkness obtained dominion over all this and took
pleasure therein? And what is the cause of its fierceness so that at last the
Darkness is imprisoned and tormented in it? If its 'Essential nature' has this
strength, then where was <A HREF="#lxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxii</SPAN></A> it
&quot;formerly? But if this energy conies from another place, why did it not
come formerly? So that instead of the Grave which is now built stupidly for the
Darkness, an impregnable wall should have been built, and thus there would have
been (<i>a separation</i>) between the two Domains, (such a wall) as it would be
fitting for the Good (Being) to make, and right for the Just (Being) to keep in
repair, and proper for the Wise (Being) to guard. But after those atrocities
which the Darkness wrought [Cf. p. XXXV.] upon the Light, and after those
blasphemies which the Souls blasphemed against their Father, and after they
committed fornication and folly and polluted and disgraced themselves, [P. 90.]
and after great blemishes have appeared in them, so that, although their wounds
may be healed, they cannot be effaced, and the places of their spots cannot be
covered up, after all this Strife and Contention, and after all this misery and
loss [Cf. p. lvi. ll.13, 26 f.] --even if there was a gain, the gain of such
things would not be equal to the loss--he has planned to-day to build a Grave
for the Darkness so that at last it may be imprisoned there.</p>
<p>And how can a Grave limit him who is infinite? For if the Darkness can be
limited, then the Light also can be limited. And if the Good (Being) cannot be
limited, but the Evil One can be limited, it is clear that this Evil One who can
be limited is not an (eternal) Entity, the Companion of that Good (Being) who is
not limited; and it is found that that which limits is an (eternal) Entity, and
that which is limited by whoever is able to limit him, is a creature. But if he
is not a creature and is an (eternal) Entity, an Entity cannot limit an Entity
without itself being also limited by that other one, his equal, which is
limited.[P. 91.]</p>
