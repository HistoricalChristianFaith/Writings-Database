<p align="center"><b>ANOTHER DISCOURSE AGAINST MARCION.</b></p>
<p>[P. 117.] IF the organs <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> of the body suffice for
the gifts of the Good (God), O Marcion, that is to say, the eye for His light,
and the ear for His voice, why then does the body not live at the last ? But if
the body does not suffice for these good things at the last, no[thing] else in
this world suffices for them. Therefore neither is the heart sufficient for
knowledge of the Stranger, nor hearing for the study (<i>lit. </i>reading) of
Him. Moreover, as to the fact that the souls do not sin in the Kingdom, is it
because of their nature, which is good, that they do not sin ? And how then did
the evil body change the good nature ? But if the Stranger changes them there,
though they are evil, what sin did the body commit [P. 118.] so as to be
deprived of this desirable change ? But if the souls are good there, is it
because they enter that region that they are good, or are they good from the
point where they stripped off their bodies ? If this desirable state be due to
the place, let the body also enter into it, and likewise all men [<i>in whom</i>]
are sins. . . .</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>[P. 119, l.5] ... [And as] Fire is not [separated from Heat, so Evil is not
constituted apart from its power. But how and wherefore does that which is hot
retain its natural heat, when that which is cold did not remain in its natural
state ? If therefore it is an Existence and an Entity, they are [not] changed in
nature.&nbsp; But if that creative power has made out of nothing something good,
it [can] be changed in character. For this ye have learnt, (namely) that they
are created from nothing, because a thing which is created from nothing can be
changed into <A HREF="#lv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lv</SPAN></A> anything. And if it is
not created, it is always 'bound' by its essential nature ; for, (in the case
of) a thing which can be changed into anything, its change bears witness
concerning it that it [<i>does not come</i>]<i> </i>from an unchangeable
Existence. But if it is possible for the souls to strip off their bodies, they (<i>i.e.
</i>the souls) are purged of all evils. Why did he who came come ? Was it to
bring life to the body which [P. 120.] [was] without life, or to come and change
the soul which was (already) alive ? . . . And henceforth they are dragged again
[l. 17.] from struggle to struggle, and therefore also weapons and crucifixion
are necessary to them (?) in the Kingdom. And if not, for what reason are the
souls which are very evil here not evil there ? For if this is due to the place
then also their Creator is able to bring them up to a place which is raised
above and higher than H<SPAN class="small">ULE</SPAN>. And if they say that they
(<i>i.e. </i>the souls) cannot conquer even there, (I reply that) if it be the
fact that the Stranger constrains us to conquer in the region of Evil and (in)
the body of Sin, how much more will the Maker give us the victory in a place
which is raised above Evil and also above the body of Sin ! But if even thus it
(the soul) cannot conquer, it is then unjust in the Stranger to demand of us
victory in a [P. 121] region where there is no possibility of our being
victorious. But if, when the souls have stripped off the body of Sin and are
lifted up again to a region which is raised above Sin, the souls are still
polluted even there, how do they say that in that region of the Good they are
purged ? And why then do they blame the body by asserting that 'it causes the
soul to sin,' when in reality, in all this interval of time, the nature of the
soul is found to be evil ? And how at the present time do the souls become good
in the Kingdom ? For if the Stranger creates a new mode of existence (<i>lit. </i>another
creation) for them there, if He is able to change the mode of existence of the
soul, it may be that He can change the soul's nature. But if the nature is
changed by creative power, then the evil was not in the essence (of the soul)
but in the creative power, and hence the Maker can change <A HREF="#lvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lvi</SPAN></A>
the nature according to His will, as also other created beings testify who serve
according to the will of their Creator. And therefore when Isu came to us, He
ought to have made use of [P. 122.] creative power and not of preaching, for
creative power changes natures, whereas preaching does not; and this is proved
to thee by craftsmen, that is to say, even by potters and smiths.</p>
<p>But if when our Lord came He did not wish to change the natures, was it as a
kind and wise Being that He did not wish to change the natures ? Was it as a
kind and wise Being that He did not wish to destroy that which was well adjusted
? Or was it as an evil and envious Being that He did not wish to adjust that
which was badly constructed ?<i> </i>But if it was because our Lord saw it to be
rightly fashioned that He did not even adjust any part of it, how do they say
that the Maker repented of the work to which<i> </i>our Lord Himself testified
that it was rightly fashioned ? Or how again, when our Lord praises it, do they
find fault with it ? But know that by the fact that He praised the latter one it
is seen that He agrees with the former one, and by the fact that they find fault
they themselves are seen to disagree with the latter (and) also with the former.
But in which (respect) is our Lord seen to have praised the work of the Maker ?
Is it not by the fact that [<i>they find fault, but He was</i>] [P. 123.] one
who repaired the normal arrangement ? <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> For it was
not abnormal eyes, alien to nature, that our Lord gave to the blind man, but
eyes in accordance with nature. [<i>If</i> <i>He were</i>] a Stranger, it would
be reasonable that just as He gave us laws which were alien to the Maker in like
manner He should give us also physical organs which are alien to the Maker. But
if He changed laws but did not wish to change physical organs, it is seen that
the organs are (works) of God, and our Lord, who changed the laws from
generation to generation, did not change the organs in any generation.</p>
<p>But they say, 'The sole reason of His not changing (them) was that they might
not think concerning Him that He was a Stranger, and (so) persecute Him.' The
laws therefore which He changed, did He change them in order that they might <A HREF="#lvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lvii</SPAN></A>
think concerning Him that He was not a Stranger ? In which of the two
circumstances, then, was strangeness most powerfully to be seen, in the change
of laws or in the change of organs ? For even a feeble human being can change
laws, but (only) a powerful Maker can change organs. Would that He had changed
[the] mind and had not changed the law, so that [a man] might see its excellence
and not its difficulty ! For when new creations came to pass [in] men more
strangeness [P. 124.] [<i>would arise</i>] <i>. . . </i>.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>For just as by the fact that He [changed] the laws He shewed [l. 22.]
strangeness, [so] by the fact that He did not change the bodily organs He
annulled the strangeness. But if our Lord [made] the two of them one &#8212; for He
gave to the hearers additional interpretations which were not in the Law, but He
did not give to those who were to be healed additional organs which were not in
nature, (it was) in order that when contumacious persons treat Him as a stranger
because He abrogated laws they may be convicted of error by the fact that He
maintained the normal arrangement of nature. Again, He gave new laws and
maintained primeval nature, in order that when He is treated as a stranger on
account of the new laws primeval nature may come forward and prove concerning
Him that He is not the son of a [P. 125] stranger.</p>
<p>But if He is a stranger, as they assert concerning Him, then this thing which
He did was exceeding foolish ; for He abrogated the former commandments and
maintained the former nature. For, as I have already said, He ought, as a
strange law-giver, to have created on that account a strange nature also, so
that, just as His law was seen to be something more than the former law, in like
manner His creation also might be seen to be something more than the creation of
the Creator. But if &quot;in His law our Lord was a stranger, but in His action
one of the household,&quot; <sup><A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> </sup>this is (a
description of) the foolish Marcion, who is partly inside and partly outside.
And they ought therefore, if they are lovers of true things, to remain in doubt
; for if they called Him a stranger on account of the new sayings which He
uttered, then <A HREF="#lviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lviii</SPAN></A> because He did
not create a strange creation the bold preaching ought to have been buried in
silence (<i>lit. </i>confined within silence). For the Marcionites preach two
things concerning our Lord which are at variance with each other, for &quot;He
abrogated the former laws and healed injured organs.&quot; But here this man,
[P. 126.] whoever he may be, is seen to be alien to the creation in virtue of
his teaching and akin to it in virtue of his activity.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
But let us see which is the true 'strangeness,' that which consists in sayings
or that which consists in deeds. If that which consist in sayings is true, their
contentious doctrine is true, but if that which consists in deeds is true our
faith has received the crown.</p>
<p>Let us know therefore who was a stranger to the world&#8212; Ho who instituted in
it new laws, or He who created in it strange creatures ? For He who institutes
in the world new laws is not a stranger to the world, since in that world new
laws have been issued from generation to generation ; but He who created strange
creatures was perhaps considered to be a stranger, since no strange creature has
(ever) appeared in the world. If therefore the Marcionites proclaim that our
Lord gave eyes to the blind, it is a good thing that from their own mouth their
condemnation is proclaimed. For instead of bestowing strange eyes, that it might
be known that He was a stranger, He restored to health these former ones, that
it might be known that He is that (Being) who existed in former times. But this
thing, which they proclaim to others, is to themselves a thing unheard of ; for
their hearing [P. 127.] is at variance with their tongue, just as their
intention is at variance with their Maker. For the Creator and Lawgiver
abolished the former laws and gave other laws, but He did not abolish the former
sun and create another sun ; again He replaced the Old Covenant (<font face="SPIonic">diaqh&amp;kh</font>)<i>
</i>by a New Covenant, but He did not abolish the old heaven and create another
heaven. With regard therefore to Him who creates natures and gives laws, just as
it was easy for Him to change laws so it would have been easy for Him to change
natures. But wherefore He who changed laws did not wish to change the creation
thou mayest hear from us abundantly, if there is not with thee that
contentiousness which is wont to resist abundant (proofs), which, though it is <A HREF="#lix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lix</SPAN></A>
supposed that with its labour it really acquires them, does not [know] that it
is driving away from beside itself an acquisition without labour. For the
contention of the hearer is [an impediment to] the gifts that come forth from
the mouth of the speaker.</p>
<p>Hear therefore why it was that He who abolished the former laws did not
abolish the former creatures ! He created the creatures in accordance with His
own perfection, but He gave [P. 128.] many laws in account of our imperfection.
For if we had abided perfectly by the law which He has written on the
heart&#8212;(the law) which was followed by Abel and by Enoch who did not taste
death&#8212;laws varying from nation to nation would not even be required. Thus
where the creatures (are concerned, permanence of species is due to) the
perfection of the Creator, who in all respects is perfect; and where laws (are
concerned, the diversity is due to) the imperfection of man, who in all respects
is audacious. God, therefore, did not abolish the former creatures, lest we
should think that He had actually received advice or had been taught to create
creatures superior to the former creatures ; but He gave many laws, that in many
(ways) He might restrain the audacity which did not abide by the former law
which was written on the heart.</p>
<p>But man, on account of his imperfection, when he does something, is taught by
his experience of former things to do something more than (those) former things
; whereas the Creator, since He is perfect in His Wisdom, even before He
creates, each separate thing that He wishes to do is completely visible to Him:
But perhaps thou wilt say, 'Lo, creatures were transformed in Egypt!' They were
transformed in Egypt on [P. 129.] account of the tyranny of Pharaoh, but they
did not undergo transformation on account of <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> . . .</p>

<p>[P.130. l.29][<i>For the Will that bound the course of Nature </i><A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
(<i>is able to alter it</i>)<i> and we learn that He who relaxed the Laws was
Himself the</i> <A HREF="#lx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lx</SPAN></A> [l. 38.] <i>establisher
of the Laws</i>.] For a composite nature cannot remain in its composite state
without the . . . power of its Creator, and a law cannot be annulled without the
good will of its Maker ; [P. 131.] for where there is power to make there is
also wisdom which directs the things that are made, and where there is Justice
which punishes sins there is also Grace. . . . For consider that One who is good
cannot shew mercy save to those who have transgressed His just law, for if He
has compassion with regard to the law of another He has deflected from goodness
and also ignored justice, so as to incline altogether towards iniquity. For that
Stranger who becomes the pardoner of debtors necessarily wrongs the creditor.
&quot;But,&quot; it is said, &quot;He paid our debt by His death.&quot; But know
that we owed a real debt: if therefore He died in reality, He also paid our debt
in reality ; but if it was in appearance that He died, that debt of ours also
was paid in by a fraud. Yet know that the Good One also was pleased by this
deception, that He should come and pay our debt by a fraud. Yet He who is just
and mighty is not mocked, for in virtue of His justice He does not act wrongly
and in virtue of His might He is not mocked. For the Just One would not act [P.
132.] wrongly so as to come, when our debt has been paid, and demand the paid
debt afresh, nor again would the Mighty One be mocked, so to allow His real
possessions to be snatched from Him, without receiving anything real in exchange
for His real possessions. &quot;But,&quot; it is said, &quot;though the Just One
is mighty, the Good One is nevertheless mightier than He.&quot; If therefore He
overcame Him by might, how <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><i> </i>do they bring in
the term 'purchase'? [<i>Call</i>] Him therefore a doer of violence and not a
purchaser. But if He made a real purchase, as one who acted humbly, how was
'might' involved in the affair ? For either let them choose for themselves that
He purchased as a humble and true (Being), or else let them choose for
themselves that He did violence, as one who is mighty and tyrannical.</p>
<p>But since the followers of Marcion were ashamed to be sponsors for the term
'violent robbery' (as applicable) in the case of the Stranger, they have used
with reference to Him the term 'purchase in humble fashion,' and because they
are refuted in <A HREF="#lxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxi</SPAN></A> the matter of the
purchase, they have used with reference to Him the term 'might,' so that when it
is asserted against them that He did violence they say that He merely purchased,
and when again it is asserted against them that the Maker did not wish to sell
his possessions they say that He (<i>i.e. </i>the Stranger) is mightier than He
(<i>i.e. </i>the Maker). Each of the (two) assertions [P. 133.] therefore annuls
the other. For if it is a 'purchase in humble fashion,' consent (<i>lit. </i>will)
and not compulsion is involved, but if the purchaser overcomes by force he does
not really purchase but seizes by violence. If therefore they introduce (the
mention of) His might, which is a plausible term, (the notion of) violent
robbery comes in with it . . .</p>

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>[P.134, l.26] let them learn that it is a doctrine (artificially) constructed
and . . ., which has no foundation (<i>lit. </i>root); for the poets likewise
construct fables out of bare names, their fables being devoid of foundation, for
the poets make use of names . . .</p>

<p>[P.135, l. 21.] On that account He gave that which is His own in order that
He may take that which is not His own. And again, if there is no affinity
between the purchaser and the seller, in their mutual action, they cannot give
to one another or receive from one another. For that which they give is
profitable to both, and again that which they receive is pleasing and profitable
to both. But if they have heard only the word 'purchase' and hence have
introduced the mention of 'strangeness' (<i>lit. </i>and from it have named
strangeness), they ought to have made mention of 'strangeness' from the days of
Isaiah onwards, who said <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> &quot;For nought have ye
been sold,&quot; and thenceforward it would have been a purchase in reality,
that the People was sold, that it should serve its masters. But if there is no
strangeness in [P. 136.] a real purchase, how can there be strangeness in a
fraudulent <A HREF="#lxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxii</SPAN></A> purchase ? But if
they say that the Just One did not perceive the Good One, (I reply) 'And how was
it that that Good and Humble One came to purchase something which its owner did
not wish to sell&#8212;something which it did not even enter His mind to sell ?' But
if they say something that pleases them they must hear something that does not
please them. For it pleases them to say this, that this Just One did not
perceive that Good One ; but it does not please them that some man should say
concerning that Good One that He robs with violence. But this (statement) which
does not please them is derived from that (statement) which pleases them. For if
the Just One did not perceive the Good One, He therefore did not even
contemplate the selling of His possessions to Him, for lo, He did not even
perceive that He (<i>i.e. </i>the Good One) existed ! But if He did not perceive
Him and moreover did not contemplate the selling (of anything) to Him, it
necessarily follows that if He sold (anything) He was compelled by force to sell
that which He did not [P. 137.] wish to sell. But perhaps they may say that even
if the Good One compelled the Just One by force it was only for our salvation
that He compelled Him by force. Know that in this respect He was on a level with
all robbers. For he also who goes forth to take by robbery a possession that is
not his own puts pressure on the possessor by reason of his love for the
possession ; and, in a word, all those who take away things from their owners;
it is because of the love which they have for the things themselves that they
grieve the heart of their possessors. But they say, &quot;Even if the Good One
put pressure on the Just One by snatching us from Him, He only took us to
Himself in a loving manner.&quot; (But this is no argument), for what thief is
there who will steal a precious pearl from his neighbour and will not keep it
lovingly and carefully after taking it away ? And on this supposition all
evil-doers are found to be acting, not in an evil manner, but mercifully and
kindly. For what robber is there who goes forth to take away or to filch
something hateful and [undesirable] in his own eyes ? Why therefore have the [P.
138.] Marcionites adorned with fair titles One who in His conduct is not
different from evil-doers ? But far be it from us to speak thus concerning our
Lord ! But it is only on account of them (<i>i.e.</i> <A HREF="#lxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxiii</SPAN></A>
the Marcionites) that we are obliged to say these things for their refutation,
so that if they are convinced these things will not be reckoned to us to our
detriment, on account of the advantage (which accrues) to them, and if they are
not convinced they will pay the penalty for it, that their confusion (of mind)
led us to use words that are not seemly. But even if we utter the blasphemy
(only) with our lips, and not in our heart, nevertheless who is there who wishes
to taste, even with his lips (only), the deadly poison ? For as to that which is
not seemly, would that it had never in our life (?) entered our mind !</p>
<p>But nevertheless let us return to our former subject, which we abandoned for
a while on account of the pretext of 'purchase.' If therefore before the coming
of Isu this [convention] <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> existed, O Marcion, that
is to say, that though laws were changed from generation to generation the order
of nature <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> was fixed and . continued (<i>lit. </i>came)
through all generations, we see that if our [P. 139.] Lord came and diverged
from this [convention] <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> of the Maker it is evident
that He was<i> </i>'strange' to the Maker. But if He proceeded in accordance
with this order it is manifest that this beseemed the Son that His steps should
hasten in the footprints of Him that begat Him, for He also . . . But the Son
[1. 17.] also preserved by His healing the normal arrangement of the former
body, that He might testify, as their Father did, that the creatures were
created aright from the Beginning. Our Lord therefore is not found to resemble a
destroyer, nor a stranger, for He did not injure healthy organs . . . nor,
again, when He healed did He bestow abnormal organs, nor, again, did He <i>[make
it</i> [1. 33.] <i>appear</i>] to them by His creative power that He was alien
to the Maker, but He preserved organs that were healthy, and cured organs that
were hurt. But (?) He who preserves healthy organs, in order that they may not
be hurt, plainly testifies concerning Him who created them that He is perfect
and (that) it is not right that His arrangement should be hurt. But He who [P.
140.] sets in order organs that have been hurt testifies concerning <A HREF="#lxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxiv</SPAN></A>
a creative power (shared) in common, (namely) that He is a fellow-workman to Him
who set them in order from the Beginning ; and it is evident that it was a love
(shared) in common which constrains Him to set in order by a common mode of
workmanship the common work. For when the work of a craftsman is injured it
cannot be set right save by him who made it, or by a fellow-workman to him who
made it. These are two things from which the Marcionites have deflected, for
they are not willing to call our Lord 'the Maker,' nor (do they admit) that He
was (sent) by the Maker. But His active power itself deprives those who deprive
Him of active power, especially because that active power of His was repairing
the work of the Creator. But it is clearly seen that this is a thing learnt from
Him, (I mean) that primeval Teacher who is the Architect of the creation. But
this active power was sent as to the first of creatures,<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
in order that it might be known that by this same active power the creatures had
been created. For the repair of a work can only be wrought by means of that
workmanship which set it in order.</p>
<p>[p. 141.] But when this perfect Disciple of that perfect Architect came, not
that He was a learner, nor was His Teacher instructed, in virtue of that
workmanship which (proceeded) from Himself (and) in which the normal
arrangements were included from the Beginning&#8212;when He came, therefore, He
ordered aright the hands which He had made, that they might give alms to those
who lacked health, whereas He found them (such) that, instead of giving alms
from that which was their own, they committed thefts from that which was not
their own. But because the hands did not perform that service on account of
which He created them He was empowered, as a just Maker, to command that the
hands should wither up. But instead of this He commanded that hand which was
withered to be stretched forth ; <sup><A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> </sup>for
He knew the effrontery of the Marcionites, that if when He was restoring and
repairing the corruption of the natures they call Him 'strange' to Nature, if
His deed had been contrary to Nature how much more would they have considered
Him 'strange' ? But because they are perverse, perhaps if our Lord [P. 142.] had
done contrary to Nature they would not have considered <A HREF="#lxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxv</SPAN></A>
Him 'strange!' But even if they had been as it were able to learn perversely,
yet for the upright Teacher it was not seemly that because of the perverse ones
He also should teach perversity,</p>

<p align="left"><i>I have moved the footnotes to the end.&nbsp; Those consisting
of &quot;Read [syriac] for [syriac]&quot; or similar have been omitted, as it
has not been possible to transcribe the fragments of Syriac.&nbsp; The pages are
numbered with Roman numerals.&nbsp; Arabic numbers and line numbers relate to
the Syriac text printed at the back of the paper volume.&nbsp; Greek text is rendered using the Scholars Press

<p><A NAME="#1"></A>1.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> For this translation of <i>haddame, </i>generally
rendered 'limbs,' see p. xxi, 1. ] 1, where Ephraim says &quot;by thy <i>haddame,
</i>that is, by thy senses.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#2"></A>2.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> P. 122, ll. 44, 45, are obscure, but
the sense seems to be as above.</p>
<p><A NAME="#3"></A>3.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> This is evidently quoted as a
Marcionite saying.</p>
<p><A NAME="#4"></A>4.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The same word as is translated
'creative power,' pp. lv (last line), lxiii f.</p>
<p><A NAME="#5"></A>5.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Here follows a very illegible page,
containing an allusion to Hezekiah and the Sundial (Isaiah xxxviii 8), p. 129,
11. 15-22.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="#6"></A>6.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Not quite the same phrase as James iii
6.</p>
<p><A NAME="#7"></A>7.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <i>Lit. </i>&quot;How do they name
purchase in the midst ? &quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#8"></A>8.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Isaiah lii 3.</p>
<p><A NAME="#9"></A>9.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> The word [Syriac], which occurs twice
in this context, is legible in the Palimpsest. It is probably a distortion of
some foreign word, <i>e.g. </i><font face="SPIonic">to_ eu0a&amp;reston</font><i>
</i>or the Latin <i>orbita.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#10"></A>10.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> <i>Lit. </i>'natures,' <i>i.e. </i>the
various distinct species.</p>
<p><A NAME="#11"></A>11.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Cf. Colossians i 15.</p>
<p><A NAME="#12"></A>12.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Luke vi 10.</p>
<p><A NAME="#13"></A>13.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Luke v 36 (Matt, ix 16).</p>
<p><A NAME="#14"></A>14.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> The concluding sentence is mostly
illegible, but the reference to the ' rent' is clear. [...]</p>
