<h3 align="center">AGAINST BARDAISAN.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>A DISCOURSE AGAINST BAKDAISAN.</b> <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>
<p>[P. 143.]</p>
<p>I. BARDAISAN, lo, declares--that even without the sin of Adam--the Body
would turn to its dust,--that Flesh does not cleave to Spirit,--that the dregs
run downward--and the fine material upward,--and . . .--the one its height
and the other its depth.</p>
<p>II. His opinion is diseased, similar--to the infirmity of Bardaisan,--his
whole mythology is sickly.--&quot;For if,&quot; says he, &quot;[it is] by
Adam--we die the Death of here below,--it would have been right that He who
came--should have given Life here below--that he might render recompense for
the usury paid.&quot;</p>
<p>III. But our judges are judged--before that Truth which is from
judgement;--they are being judged, the judges--of all [P. 144.] judgements
that [are] judged in error.--The truth of it judges the judges,--for Verity
[cometh] in judgement;--by its truth it is the victor--of the wickedness
hidden in the judges.</p>
<p>IV. When by artifice Error judges--that it may conquer the truth,--it is
judged secretly--by the knowledge of the truth. --Wherefore not again has
Verity [come]--if open audacities have changed it,--for its victory in
truth--holds the crown over it.</p>
<p>V. To the word of truth . . . the healthy ear [<i>is a test :</i>]<i> . . .
--</i>the healthy mouth also is a test<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>--to fruit
sweet [and bitter]--the mouth teaches the taste--to the eye that has erred by
the sight.</p>
<p>VI. For that inexperience--of the eye which sees [all forms]--is obedient
to the mouth which tries [all] tastes--[that thou] <A HREF="#lxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxvii</SPAN></A>
mayest learn [thereby the wholesomeness] of fruits ; [so] also the inexperience
-- of the ear that hears all words -- (is obedient) to the heart that tries
all words -- that thou mayest learn thereby the force of the words.</p>
<p>VII. Let us be like to the ordinary (physical) body -- whose [P. 145.]
organs are equal in love, -- for the sound organ that has stumbled -- its
fellow that is skilful admonishes it. -- Let the lover[s] of truth also become
-- one Body against Error -- that [our] lack may be filled -- . . .</p>
<p>VIII. A true decision bears witness -- that the transgression of Adam --
turned the Body to a principle <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> -- that looses the
fixing of its life, -- for if we have seen that our Lord also -- fixed the
mortal Body -- with life that cannot be loosed -- His truth has borne away the
crown.</p>
<p>IX. Our disputation has entered a contest -- that from two sides, lo, is
approached, -- that on two sides it may be crowned, -- for in that one
involves the other -- in the common contest they are alike. -- For if our Lord
put on the Body -- with the life of Paradise He rewarded it, -- because it
lost its life there.</p>
<p>X. Compare, then, and let us take the [trial]s -- of our Lord that thou
mayest know, if they are like -- to bodily and mortal ones, -- whether He put
on the Body, or not. -- Begin then with the Birth -- and go on to finish with
the Death -- and include in the middle -- His human mode of life.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
<p>XI. For they are bound one to the other -- His truths that bound Error ; --
in that His Death persuades us about His [P. 146.] Birth -- that He put on a
mortal Body ; -- His Resurrection bears witness to His Death -- that the Body
which died was raised. -- For His Birth is bound up with His Death, -- and His
Death is bound up with His Resurrection.</p>
<p>XII. For our Lord has fixed the traditions -- of His truth like the bodily
organs, -- [which] He has fixed in one another, -- that when contention and
Error -- wish to cut off an organ -- the Body all of it wails -- and the
organs [from all] sides -- are crying out about that one which is cut off.</p>
<p>XIII. The Truth is living and life-giving to all, -- lo, the <A HREF="#lxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxviii</SPAN></A>
tastes of it bear witness to it.--For lo, by a myriad trials-- the affair of
our Lord is learnt,--that in the Body He died and was raised,--and His Birth
and His Death have become a test <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>--for the very
Body which He put on,--that not in appearance and fraud did He put it on.</p>
<p>XIV. [When] He confessed His [mys]tery to Thomas,--who by touch wished to
examine Him,--He gave His Body to the touch of the hand,--that the sense of
touch also should be a [P. 147.] test to Him ;--there came to him the word of
Truth,--that will cast out all contention,--&quot;For a spirit hath not
bones&quot; ; <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>-- in truth He put on His bodily
organs.</p>
<p>XV. For even if ... --proclaims that our Lord was clothed with a
Body,--Contention stops up its ears--and in perversity proclaims something
else,--that our Saviour did not put on the Flesh.--And if its perversity in
truth justifies us--how much more will His correctness justify us ?</p>
<p>XVI. But I think that Truth--thus conquers Error--not when . . . --the
eloquent ... to run,--but . . . with Him--his running surpasses their
running,--as . . -- . . and is crowned.</p>
<p>XVII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;<br>
for what reason and wherefore--the Body cannot for ever--be accompanied for
ever by the soul.</p>
<p>XVIII. [For] if we say that it is a House-- . . .</p>
<p>[P. 148.] XIX. For a snare, lo, is spread-- . . .</p>
<p>XX. And if . . .</p>
<p>XXI. These things that [are] supposed --to be strange to one another,--[and
also] are not acceptable to one another--are one, and are from one, and in
one,--for they exist in one creation --and from one Air are nourished--and by
one Death are cut off --and to one Working are obedient. <A HREF="#lxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxix</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXII. But see the seed, that as ...<br>
. . . -- that in the bosom of its mother it may take refuge, -- and [P. 149.]
leaven out of all bosom[s] -- in the mass of dough takes refuge alone. -- The
bosom of the earth is the opposite of the [seed], -- and when aforetime it was
growing up in it -- in the mode of [its species] it grew up.</p>
<p>XXIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;<br>
-- whether the Will [of] the Creator -- begat the wealth of diversities --
that are regarded as opposites, -- or that there are Entities, strangers --
and not related to one another -- and . . .</p>
<p>XXV. That Error much distresses me -- . . .<br>
... in the Beginning, -- that what they say about the end -- [P. 150.] we may
say to them about the beginning.</p>
<p>XXVI. I know that if . . .</p>
<p>XXVII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXVIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXIX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXX. What good therefore [has] death, -- if when life abounds -- . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXXI.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Now let us turn for a little -- to a
question . which [P. 151.] is before this, -- that she may not be bereaved by
having been left -- let Truth then run to meet her -- holding fast the victory
of her sister -- and announcing to her about Error, -- that it had become a
mark for the arrows -- that she also may begin to mock at it.</p>
<p>XXXII. Body and Soul have been invited -- to Paradise, and in Paradise --
they were honoured and returned in disgrace, -- they were disgraced and have
returned in honour ; -- Body and Soul entered together, -- Body and Soul went
out together, -- by death they were separated one from the other, -- and in
resurrection again they are joined. <A HREF="#lxx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxx</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXXIII.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> The death that God decreed--for Adam
after he sinned,--it is not the wicked killing--whereby men kill their
fellow-men ;--the killing of Abel the righteous--was from the Free-will that
wronged him,--and the death of Adam the sinner--was from the justice that
requited him.</p>
<p>XXXIV. It was not the case then because--the killing of Abel the righteous
was previous--to the death of Adam the sinner <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>--that
Abel died first--by that death that is from God : [P. 152.] --Free-will in its
audacity--made an assault on Abel in its envy,--and brought in lulling before
death.</p>
<p>XXXV. By that sentence from the Judge--Adam died first,--by that killing
from Man--Abel was killed first; <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>--they stand
in the domain--of Justice and of Free-will,--Justice is not wronged--and
Free-will is not constrained.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> And lo, there go down from the
beginning--the two ways of death,--one of sentence and one of killing.--For
as Free-will brought in--killing before death in the Beginning,--so Justice
brought in--death after sin.</p>
<p>XXXVII. He<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> Who knew beforehand that the
killed-- would be killed by the killers--by the lulling set a bound to their
life--though He be far from the blame--of the killers who have dared to
kill,--and is far also from (the blame for) the accident-- of the killed man
who is killed by sudden death.</p>
<p>XXXVIII. If therefore one who is killed--goes not in sentenced time it is an
accident,--and if he goes in his time it [P. 153.] is a scandal--for it
justifies the one who killed him,--yet God is high--above accident and also
above scandal;--it is not an accident, in that the sentenced time drew
nigh--and it is not a scandal, in that there is about to be a judgement. <A HREF="#lxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxi</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XXXIX. But however much, lo, they are explained--these things have need of
explanation,--for it is hard (to explain) how--there should chance in the one
hour--the hidden sentenced time of him who is killed--and also the will of the
killer,--that the man killed should go in his sentenced time--and the killer
with his weapon be held guilty.</p>
<p>XL. Let us turn aside now from these things--for it was not these things we
are concerned with ;--an investigation against those in error--we have been
concerned with to conquer therein.--For not a little loss is it--that has
entered through Bardaisan,--that inexperienced folk who have heard have
suffered loss--of the merchandise of their lives.</p>
<p>XLI. And that ignorant folk may not go astray,--saying that &quot;Abel, he
died first,&quot;--and disturb the comparison--that is struck between our Lord
and Adam :--let them know that killing is of man--but the sentenced time is
from God;--for as regards Abel wickedness killed him,--but as regards Adam the
[P. 154.] Just One made him die.</p>
<p>XLII. But not even for this will there be--an opportunity for thee to hinder
the inexperienced--in that as regards our Lord it was men who killed Him--and
as regards Adam the Just One made him die :--Adam that sinned against
Justice-- God in the sentenced time made him die,--but our Lord that killed
wickedness--by wicked men was the killing of Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XLIII. If the Body depends upon the Soul,<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>--lo,
the Soul also like the Body--upon another Power depends wholly-- namely, on
that Power which gives life to everything.--And as (in the case of) the Soul if
it lets go--of the Body, it (the Body) is undone and falls to pieces,--the
Power also that gives life to the Soul--if it lets it go, it (the Soul) is
undone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XLIV. If the Body, that is mixed with--the Soul and is its companion,--they
say cannot cleave to it,--the light one, because of the weight of it (the
Body),--how can they cleave,-- Entities corporeal and heavy,--to that Power
which is above everything subtle--to live in it for ever and ever ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>XLV. Well, then, let us also say--that if the Body because of its
weight--breaks away from the limpid Soul,--that limpid [P. 155.] <A HREF="#lxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxii</SPAN></A>
substance is also separated--from the Power that is more limpid than it,--[<i>and
as</i>]<i> </i>in the case of the Body--the same retribution comes to it (the
Soul)--from that Power which took hold of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XLVI. For to both of them it (the Soul) is strange--to that limpid one and
to the turbid one ;--to the turbid one because of the impurities,--[to] the
limpid one because of its refinement.-- If the one is for ever in it--the Body
would be ever beside it ;--it does cleave to that which is more limpid than
[it],--and that which is more [turbid] than it cleaves to it.</p>
<p>XLVII. For it is not the Power of its nature-- . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;</p>
<p>XLVIII. As for the Entities that Bardaisan brought in-- he is to be accused
because he taught--that one is heavier<sup>1</sup> than its fellow--and one is
lighter than its fellow ;--he put the evil ones as the lower,--he put the good
ones as the upper,--he put Light and Wind as fine,--Fire and Water as
heavy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XLIX. If the lower one . . . --does not adhere to the one higher than
it,--neither does Water that is corporeal-- [P. 156][cleave] to Fire that is
lighter,--nor Fire to limpid Wind--nor does Wind cleave to Light,--nor any of
them to God--Who is higher than all of them and more refined.</p>
<p>L. But if they are acceptable as friends,--all these Entities to one
another,--those that are heavy and those that are light,-- and possess and are
possessed by one another,--that Highest One who gave them their level--does
not treat the lowest one as alien ;--and if He treat the lowest one as
alien--He cannot treat the middle one as akin.</p>
<p>LI. For on one side of the two is with him--weakness or wickedness ;--but
if He be Evil, how is He the Good One ?-- and if He be weak, how is He the
Creator ?--and if as the Good One He humiliated Himself--unto the middle
(Entities) which were at strife,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>--all of them
with all He would have reconciled--that His kindness might not suffer loss.</p>
<p>LII.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> But look upon Man--and see that all of
them are reconciled :--his heat is from Fire,--his cold from Wind,--his <A HREF="#lxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxiii</SPAN></A>
dampness from Water,--his dryness from the Dust;--in the midst of him dwells
Life,--creative power holds him firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LIII. And even if these (theories) were so,--that things [P. 157.] should be
so would be difficult,--as, if there were Entities,--it would be difficult
that they should be made (into anything).--an Entity cannot be destroyed,--an
Entity cannot be arranged ;--in that it is an Entity it is indestructible,--in
that it is an Entity it is unarrangeable.</p>
<p>LIV. That Creator Who is unable--to destroy the Entities that exist--by the
same analogy again is unable--to arrange the Entities that exist;--for He did
not create the existence-- therefore He cannot destroy it,--He did not
moreover arrange its fixing--therefore He cannot undo it.</p>
<p>LV and LVI.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> And if He cannot undo--the
existence of other Entities,--(an existence) which is bound by its Nature,--
the Maker also is unable--to make anything and arrange (it).-- But let Him
make the trial,--the very Maker from Himself,-- that as He cannot be
arranged--the Entities cannot be made ;--by this moreover we shall understand
as--the Body consists by the Soul,--the heavy by the power of the light,--the
Soul also is similar to the Body--in regard to the Power that is more subtle
than all.</p>
<p>LVII and LVIII.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> Against them let us say their
words,-- [P. 158.] who say that the Stranger--blew His Life into the Entities
and girded them ;--how to strange Life--are the Entities akin so that they
lived ?--If indeed the Stranger blew His Life--into the Entities so that they
became alive,--the Soul makes itself akin to the Body,--as He made His Life
akin to the Entities--that had been strangers to His Life.--But if by the
Master the servants lived,--how much more does the Body live--by the life of
the Soul its colleague ?</p>
<p>LIX. &quot;Reason,&quot; as they say,--&quot;is the strange Leaven that is
hidden--in the Soul,&quot; which is without knowledge ;--to the Body and
Reason it is strange !--If so be then the Body cannot--cleave to the Soul,
being earthy,--neither can it (the Soul) cleave--to the Reason which is
Divine. <A HREF="#lxxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxiv</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LX. We have therefore no contest--to expla[in] and persuade them--that are
thrown into the contest;--and when struggling on their behalf--their struggle
will be on our behalf,--for them the labour and for us the crown,--that when
arguing on behalf of the Soul--their argument becomes (one) on behalf of the
Body.</p>
<p>[P. 169.] LXI.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> Let us demonstrate therefore
all the more--from the created things that are before us :--for lo, Fire is
subtle--in comparison with Water that is corporeal,--[and] Wind [also in
comparison with] Light--it also is denser than Light;--the Soul also in
comparison with the Body--as their saying goes is &quot;subtle&quot;--and in
comparison with Reason it is &quot;corporeal.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXII. Let us demonstrate therefore that all--Natures are devoured by one
another,--substances' both corporeal and spiritual.--For oil is devoured by
Flame,--and Flame is devoured by Wind ;--and the oil is not perceptible in
Flame--and Flame is not [perceptible] in Wind,--for everything is easy to the
Possessor of all things.</p>
<p>LXIII.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> Water again is placed in the
middle--between Winter and Summer,--so that if the cold be fierce--it makes
it a bodily substance--that embodies it in a hard form,--and if the heat be
fierce--it makes it a spiritual substance--that absorbs it in a subtle
way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;</p>
<p>[P.160] LXV. [And if so be] that Bardaisan says--that because of its weight
it (the Body) remains therein,--from the fine [substance] of the Soul;--lo,
when the heavy one de[parts]--[there departs] also the light part,--like a
vapour [and a puff of air (?) it becomes] --and like a breath it is for a
while--and flies away lightly. LXVI. Lo, . . . --of the Entities that
Bardaisan brought <A HREF="#lxxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxv</SPAN></A>
in,--corporeal ones as he says,--in all Folds and Limbos<i>-- </i>If there be
any corporeal it is refined--, . . . created all according to His Will.</p>
<p>LXVII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXVIII. When the resurrection comes to pass--this comes to pass as the
result of it;--and if every one had been raised . . . -- [p. 161.]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXIX.&nbsp; . . . in Adam . . . all . . . were dying--though as yet they
were not born,--from the womb . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXXI. The Second Adam also-- . . . and was raised up in Sheol,--He brings
all that are [there],--in Him they were living secretly,--and when their
resurrection drew nigh--there sprang upon them the voice of .... --in that as
a dead man made the living die--the voice of resurrection makes them alive.
LXXII. For that first Thousand --is the type of that last [P. 162.]
Thousand,--in that as the death of Adam put to death--all those that that
Thousand [<i>had brought to life] </i>. . . delivered--one that flew away and
one that was rescued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXXIII. Our Lord also in the last Thousand--raises the Dead by His
resurrection--in that all the Dead are found in His Thousand,--and there comes
the Deluge of Fire--in the midst of which the Wicked sink--and the Righteous
in it are delivered ;--like Enoch the living [are] snatched away,--in the
manner of Noah the Dead are rescued.</p>
<p>LXXIV. But Bardaisan in this has erred--and wishes to make us also err
therein,--in this [he has greatly gone astray ;]--he has died, and caused all
[his comrades] to die.--&quot; Our Lord also, (says he) Who was raised,--(why)
did He not raise all Bodies,--that as their undoing was in Adam--their
reconstruction should be by our Lord ? &quot; <A HREF="#lxxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxvi</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[P. 163.] LXXV. Lo, Adam not at the moment -- when he died and fell did he
cast down everything. -- but he died in his sin -- and the world died in the
sentence on him ; -- our Lord also not at the moment -- when He was raised did
He raise everything. -- but He lived by His glorious acts -- and the world
lived in the pledge He gave.</p>
<p>LXXVI. In the hour that Adam died and fell -- the earth was full of living
beings, -- and on his account only did Death reign ; -- our Lord also gave
life now -- when Sheol was full of the dead -- on His account only does
Resurrection reign. -- Death spread from one on all, -- from [one also] spread
Resurrection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXXVII. It did not suffice Bardaisan to look -- upon [<i>the matter from
both </i>(?)] sides ; -- on the one side he looked only -- and not even on
that as it is, -- for his eye did not [see] clearly, -- that when he was
declaring about Adam, -- he that has slipped in one thing -- has slipped in
everything.</p>
<p>LXXVIIL But he does not know that that Body -- which died in Adam the
Messiah has made alive. -- The Nails bear witness to His dying. -- the
Watchers bear witness to His Resurrection, -- and the Nails that came out of
the furnace -- have become furnaces (<i>i.e. </i>tests) for our Truth ; -- the
fixing of them admonished [P. 164.] Thomas that He was not -- raised with [?]
His Soul by Himself.</p>
<p>LXXIX.<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> Bardaisan insists that if so be --
that these Bodies died in Adam -- it was right for our Lord Who came -- that
He should raise up the Bodies from the grave ; -- but if the Bodies He did not
raise, -- it is clear that the death of the Soul -- Adam brought in by his
sins, -- for the Souls which he brought down to Sheol -- our Lord brought up
with Him.</p>
<p>LXXX. He [finis]hes his word with another, -- &quot;for lo,&quot; says he,
&quot; our Lord says -- 'Every one that keepeth My word -- death for ever he
shall not taste,' <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> -- and lo, all those who kept
it have died -- [ . . . <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>]&quot; -- For he has
confused and dissolved words -- to the confusion of the inexperienced ear. <A HREF="#lxxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxvii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXXXI. And [the] word the argument of which is something else--he makes into
stuff for his argument,--for he considered about this same death--that the
Souls which are hindered in every place--in all depths and Limbos <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A><i>--</i>and
that &quot;have kept the word of our Lord,&quot;-- . . . from within the
Body,-- are exalted to the Bridal chamber of Light!&nbsp;</p>
<p>LXXXII. According to the doctrine of Bardaisan--the Death that Adam brought
in--was a hindrance to Souls--in [P. 165] that they were hindered at the
Crossing-place--because the sin of Adam hindered them,--&quot;and the
Life,&quot; he [says], &quot;that our Lord brought in--is that He taught verity
and ascended,--and [brought] them across into the Kingdom.&quot;</p>
<p>LXXXIII. &quot;Therefore,&quot; he says, &quot;our Lord taught us-- that
'every one that keepeth My Word--death for ever he shall not taste,'--that his
Soul is not hindered--when it crosses at the Crossing-place--like the
hindrance of old--wherewith the Souls were hindered--before our Saviour had
come. LXXXIV. He is caught in one of two things :--in that every one that kept
the Word of our Lord--(and) died before our Lord ; . . . --but if he is
hindered at the Crossing-place--his soul has tasted Death,--and if he had
crossed the Crossing-place--what is that which he said about our Lord.--that
He had crossed it first of all ?</p>
<p>LXXXV.<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> For if Lazarus when he died--had gone
up to the Bridal-chamber of Light--an injury <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
our Lord did him--in that He turned him back to his body the Prison-house ;
--and that which our Lord was saying--to Martha, that &quot;Thy Brother shall
rise,&quot; <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>--from whence then did He say he
[P.166] should rise--from the height, or from the deep ?</p>
<p>LXXXVI. As a Physician He did justly--in that sin the <A HREF="#lxxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxviii</SPAN></A>
bringer of pains--He was rooting out from mankind ;--for that Primal
Serpent--had bitten the Primal Adam--not with teeth but with advice,--He <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
too healed the wound--with commands and not with drugs.</p>
<p>LXXXVIL If the Soul it was He came to teach--according to their word it
would be right--that the Souls in Sheol He should teach--that they should not
steal nor commit adultery ;--and if in Sheol it is not for Souls--to lend or
be in debt, then--to Body-and-Soul in its contest--He comes to conquer and to
crown.</p>
<p>LXXXVIII.<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> An example He depicted--and a
likeness He impressed--and a mirror He fixed by His Body,--that was victorious
and tasted suffering--and was raised and put on glory ;-- and He taught that
every one who thus--conducts himself is [P. 167.] thus glorified--and he that
fights thus conquers--and he that conquers thus is crowned.</p>
<p>LXXXIX.<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> Adam, too, by him He depicted--an
example for every one to look at,--that he sinned and was sorry and brought to
confusion--and was cursed and went forth and was brought low--and departed and
was undone and destroyed,-- and He taught that every one whose support is
wickedness --even his profit is loss.</p>
<p>XC.<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> In both worlds he is mocked at,--in both
worlds he carries disgrace :--by the steps that Adam went down,--by them it
was our Lord brought him up.--In the beginning He gave him verity--instead of
the falsehood that the Serpent gave him,-- in the end He gave him
Life--instead of Death that the Tree gave;--He conjoined with him his
life,--the equilibrium of which Death had divided.</p>
<p>XCI. Seeing that of all Bodies that die--the Body of our Lord rose
only--Bardaisan erred and supposed--that it was the Souls that our Lord raised
up,--and he did not consider that the death also of Adam--had reigned in Adam
first,-- <A HREF="#lxxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|lxxix</SPAN></A> and thus after nine
hundred years--the leaven of it had spread in all generations.</p>
<p>XCII. Our Lord also when He was raised up--in Him Life [P. 168.] reigned
first,--like the Death that reigned in Adam ;--and as with Adam after a
period--his Death reigned over all,--our Lord also after a time--His
Resurrection was reigning over all,-- that the usuries paid might be like to
one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XCIII.<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> His Leaven that makes all alive
spread--in all the lump of the Dead--that, lo, is kneaded in the bosom of
Sheol,-- so that if after nine hundred years--the Leaven of Death reigned in
us,--lo, after a little--His living Leaven will conquer mortality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XCIV.<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> And now if so be this suffices,--as
also it does suffice,--this argument of ours has been spoken--about the Body
and about its Resurrection ;--the rest of the discourse of it which
remains,--the matter of it shall be ours for another day,--that we may gain by
our disputation--discoveries about our Faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XCV. Where he has fallen we have risen,--and where he has slipped we have
been strengthened,--and where he failed we seem--to have acquired the fortunes
of Adam,--in that wickedness ruled over Him in the beginning,--Death ruled
over [P. 169] him in the end,--in that his Body and his Soul sinned
together--Death divided his equilibrium.</p>
<p>XCVI. I give thanks to Thee, my Lord,--that Thou hast not stinted me, nor
hast Thou filled me :--Thou hast not stinted me that I may grow,--and Thou
hast not filled me, so that I may ask.--Satiety knows not how to ask,--and
hunger ceases not to beg ;--Thou hast satisfied me to abate my hunger,--Thou
hast made me hungry to awake my supplication.</p>

the stanza has only seven lines. Therefore some of the other stanzas, preserved
only in the Palimpsest, which have less than the eight lines, are probably
irregular owing to the author, not to a defect in the transmission.</p>
