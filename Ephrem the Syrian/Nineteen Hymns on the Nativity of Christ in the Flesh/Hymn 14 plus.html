<P>(Resp.-<I>Blessed be he who became beyond measure low, that he might make us beyond measure great</I>)</P>

<P>1. Of the Birth of the Firstborn, let us tell on His Feast-day.<SUP><A HREF="#P2931_1024377">1</A></SUP> -He gives on His day, secret comforts.-If the unclean <I>King</I> at his feast, in memory of his day,-gave the gift of wrath, the head in a charger,-how much more shall the Blessed, give blessings to him-who sings praise at His Feast!</P>

<P>2. Let us not count our vigil like vigils of every day.-His feast, its reward, exceeds an hundredfold.-For this feast makes war, on sleep by its vigil;-speaking it makes war, on silence by its voice;-clad with all blessings, it is chief of feasts,-and of every joy.</P>

<P>3. To-day the angels, and the archangels,-descended to sing-a new song on earth. -In this mystery they descend, and rejoice with the vigil-keepers.-At the time when they gave praise, blasphemy abounded.-Blessed be the Birth by which, lo! the world resounds-with anthems of praise.</P>

<P>4. For this is the night that joined, the Watchers on high with the vigil-keepers.-The Watcher came to make watchers in the midst of creation.-Lo! the vigil-keepers are made comrades with the Watchers:-the singers of praise are made, companions of the Seraphs.-Blessed be he who becomes, the harp of Thy praise!-and Thy grace becomes his reward.</P>

<P>5. The Birth then of the Firstborn, I will sing <I>and tell</I> how-the Godhead in the womb wove itself a vesture.-He put it on and came forth in birth, in death again put it off;-once he put it off, twice He put it on.-On the left He wore it, then took it off thence,-and laid it at the right.</P>

<P>6. He dwelt in a narrow bosom, the Might that rules all.-While He was dwelling there, He held the reins of the whole:-to His Father He made offering, that He might fulfil His Will:-Heaven was filled by Him, and every creature.-The Sun entered the womb, and in the height and the depth-his splendour abode.</P>

<P>7. He dwelt in the wide bosoms, of all the creatures;-too narrow to hold, the greatness of the Firstborn.-How then sufficed for it, that bosom of Mary?-Marvellous if it sufficed, bewilderment if it sufficed not.-Of all bosoms that held Him, one bosom sufficed for Him,-His, the Supreme Who begat Him.</P>

<P>8. The bosom that held Him, if it held Him Wholly,-equals the wondrous bosom, of the Supreme Who begat Him.-But who dare say the bosom, that is narrow weak and lowly,-is equal to His, Who is the Supreme Being?-He dwelt there of His mercy, though so great is His Nature:-it is without bound.</P>

<P>9. Reconciling Peace, sent to the nations!-gladdening Brightness, that camest to the sad!-Mighty Leaven in silence, overcoming all!-Patient One that hast taken, man after man in Thy net!-Happy he who has welcomed, thy joy in his heart,-and forgot his groans in Thee! </P>

<P>10. They sounded forth peace, the Watchers to the vigil-keepers.-Among the vigil-keepers the good tidings, were announced by the Watchers.-Who would sleep on that night, which has waked all creatures?-For they bear good tidings of peace, where warfare had been.-Blessed is he who has pleased, the <I>Divine</I> Majesty by his silence,-when speaking moved His wrath!</P>

<P>11. Watchers mixed with watchers, they rejoiced that the world came to life.-The Evil One was shamed who was king, and had woven a crown of lies;-and set up his throne, as God in the world.-The Babe laid in the manger, cast him from his dominion. -The Sun rendered worship, doing Him homage by his Magi;-in his worshippers he worshipped Him.</P>

<P>12. God saw that mankind, worship things created:-He put on a created body, that in our custom He might capture us.-Lo! in this <I>our</I> form, He that formed us healed us;-and in this created shape, our Creator gave us life.-He drew us not by force: blessed be He Who came in ours,-and joined us in His!</P>

<P>13. Who would not marvel, at Mary, David's daughter,-bearing an infant, and her virginity kept!-She lays Him on her breast, and lulls Him with song and He rejoices. -The Angels raise hymns, the Seraphs cry "Holy,"-the Magi offer, acceptable gifts,-to the Son Who is born.</P>

<P>14. O great above measure, immeasurably made low,-praised beyond praises, debased to humiliation!-the tender mercies laid on Thee, bowed Thee down to all this;-let Thy grace bow me down, though evil to give praise!-Happy he who becomes, a fountain of voices,-all praising Thee in all!</P>

<P>15. He was servant on earth; He is Lord in Heaven.-Heir of height and depth, He became a stranger:-Whom men judged in guile, He is judge in truth:-He Whose face they spat on, breathes His Spirit on theirs:-He Who held the frail reed, is become the staff of the world,-which grows old and leans on Him.</P>

<P>16. He Who rose to wait on His servants, now sits to be worshipped.-Whom the scribes despised, before Him Seraphs cry "Holy."-This praise Adam desired, to steal privily.-The serpent which made him fall, saw to what height he was raised:-he crushed it because it deceived him; the feet of Eve trod it down,-which had sent venom into her ears.</P>

<P>17. The wife proved barren, and withheld her fruit;-but the bosom of Mary, holily conceived.-To wonder at fields, and to admire plants-she needed not who received, and rendered what she borrowed not.-Nature confessed its defeat; the womb was aware of it,-and restored what <I>Nature</I> gave not.</P>

<P>18. Mary was defeated, in the judgment by Elizabeth.-She that was barren pleaded, that the Will which prevailed-to close the open door, has opened the closed.-He has made childless the married womb; He has made fruitful the virgin womb.-Because the People were accurst faithless, He made her that was married,-held from bearing before the face of the maiden.</P>

<P>19. He Who could give moisture, to breasts barren and dead,-caused them to fail in youth, made them to flow in age;-forced and changed nature, in its season and out of its season.-The Lord of natures changed, the Virgin's nature.-Because the People were barren, He made her that was aged,-a mouth on behalf of the damsel.</P>

<P>20. And as He began at birth, He went on and fulfilled in death.-His Birth received worship; His Death paid the debt.-As He came to His Birth, the Magi worshipped Him;-again He came to His Passion, and the thief sought refuge in Him-Between His Birth and Death, midway He set the world:-in birth and Death he gave it life.</P>

<P>21. Thousand thousands stand, and ten thousand thousands haste.-The thousands and ten thousands, cannot search out the One:-for all of them stand, in silence to serve.-He has no heir of His Throne, save the Son Who is of Him.-In the midst of silence is the enquiry into Him, when the watchers come to search Him out,-they attain to silence and are stayed.</P>

<P>22. The Firstborn entered the womb, and the pure Virgin was not harmed.-He stirred and came forth in <I>her</I> travail, and the fair Mother was troubled by Him.-Glorious and unseen in entering, humble and manifest in issuing;-for He was God in entering, and He was man in issuing.-A marvel and bewilderment to hear: fire entered the womb; put on a body and came forth!</P>

<P>23. Gabriel chief of Angels, called Him "My Lord":-he called Him "My Lord," to teach that He was his Lord, not his fellow.-Gabriel had with him, Michael as fellow: -the Son is Lord of the servants; exalted<I> is</I> His Nature as His Name.-<I>No</I> servant can search Him out; for the greater the servant,-He is great above His servant.</P>

<P>24. When they stand before Thee, the watchers with songs of praise,-they know not in what part, they shall discern Thee.-They have sought Thee above in the height; they have seen Thee below in the depth:-they have searched for Thee in the midst of heaven; they have seen Thee in the midst of the abyss:-they have discerned Thee beside Him that is worshipped; they have found Thee in the midst of the creatures: -they have come down to Thee and sung Glory to Thee.</P>

<P>25. Thou art all wonderful, in all parts where we seek Thee.-Near art Thou,-and far, and who may attain to Thee?-No seeking avails, that its stretch should reach unto Thee.-Whereon it stretches to reach Thee, it is checked and stops,-it falls short of Thy mountain; Faith reaches thither,-and Love with prayer.</P>

<P>26. The Magi also sought Him, and in the manger when they found Him,-instead of scrutiny worship, they offered Him in silence;-for empty strivings, oblations gave they Him.-Seek thou too the Firstborn, and if thou find Him in the height,-instead of troubled questionings, open thy treasures before Him,-and offer Him thy works.XV.</P>

<P>Resp. -<I>Blessed is He above all in His Birth!</I> (bis).</P>

<P>1. Celebrate, O nations, this feast, first fruits of all feasts;-recount the sufferings that were, and the wounds and pains,-that we may know what plagues, He healed,the Son Who was sent.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who sufficed to heal our pains!</I></P>

<P>2. Celebrate, O saved nations, Him Who saves all in His Birth.-Even my feeble tongue, has become a harp through<I> His</I> mercy.-The excellency of the Firstborn, in His Festival let us sing.</P>

<P><I> R., Blessed is He Who has made us meet for His Feast!</I></P>

<P>3. How then can any one, admire a physician,-until he hear and learn, what were the pains he healed?-And when our plagues are proclaimed, then is our Healer magnified.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who is exalted in our pains!</I></P>

<P>4. Created things were worshipped: because the worshipper was foolish,-he used to worship all things; but One they worshipped not.-He came down therefore in mercy and broke, the yoke that enslaved all.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who loosed our pains!</I></P>

<P>5. The mercies of the Highest were revealed; He came down and set free His creature.-In this blessed month, wherein are made releases of <I>slaves</I>,-the Lord underwentbondage, to call the bond to freedom.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is He Who brought freedom!</I>6. The Lord of the months chose Him, two months for His doings.-His Conception was in Nisan, and His Birth in Conun.-In Nisan He sanctified them that were conceived; and them that were born He set free in Conun.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who makes glad His months!</I></P>

<P>7. The Sun revealed in silence, his worshippers to his Lord:-it was grievous to him, a servant, to be worshipped instead of his Lord.-Lo! creation is glad, that the Creator is worshipped.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is the Child that is worshipped.</I></P>

<P>8. The months wore three <I>crowns</I>, and crowned Him in His triumphs.-Blessed <I>is</I> the Sun for His Birth, and for His Resurrection desired,-and for His Ascension blessed; the months have borne Him crowns.</P>

<P><I> R., Blessed be He Who has triumphed in His months!</I></P>

<P>9. Unveil and make glad thy face, O Creature, in our feast.-Let the Church sing with voice; Heaven and earth in silence!-Sing and praise the Child, who has brought release for all!</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who has annulled the bonds!</I></P>

<P>10. When fools did reverence to the Sun, in reverence to him they disgraced him.-But now when all know he is a servant, in his course his Lord is worshipped;-all servants rejoice, that as servants they are reckoned.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who ordered their natures!</I></P>

<P>11. We have done perverse things, who have become servants of servants.-Lo! our freedom compelled him, a servant, to become lord to us:-the Sun, the servant for all, we have made Lord for all.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who to Himself has turned us!</I></P>

<P>12. And the Moon too which was worshipped, has been set free by His Birth.-For 'tis strange that by her light, which enlightens the eyes,-by it the eyes were darkened, that they gazed on her as a God.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be the beam that has enlightened us!</I></P>

<P>13. Fire commended Thy Birth, which drew away worship from it.-The magi used to worship it: they who have worshipped before Thee.-They left it and worshipped its Lord; they exchanged fire for the Fire.</P>

<P><I> R., Blessed is He Who has bathed us in His light!</I>14. In place of the senseless fire that eats up its own body of itself,-the magi adored the Fire Who gave His Body to be eaten.-The live coal drew near and sanctified, the lips that were unclean.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is He Who has mixed His Fire in us!</I></P>

<P>15. Delusion blinded men, to worship created things:-fellow servants were worshipped, and the God of all was wronged.-He Who is to be worshipped came down <I>to His</I> birth, and gathered to himself worship.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is He Who by all is worshipped!</I></P>

<P>16. The All-knowing saw, that <I>men</I> worship things that were made:-He put on a body that was made, that in our custom He might take us captive,-and by a body that was made, drew us to the Creator.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who drew us with guile!</I>17. The Evil One knew how to harm us; and by lights he blinded us,-by possessions he hurt us, through gold he made us poor,-by the graver's graven images, he made us a heart of stone.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who came and softened it!</I></P>

<P>18. They grayed and set up stones, whereon men should stumble.-They set them not on the highway, for the blind to stumble on:-they called them Gods, that on them <I>with</I> open <I>eyes</I> men might stumble.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is He Who exposed the idols which they feared!</I></P>

<P>19. Sin had spread its wings, and covered all things,-that none could discern, of himself or from above, the truth.-Truth came down into the womb, came forth and rolled away error.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who dispelled Sin by His Birth!</I>20. For Mercy endured not, to see the way hindered.-When He came down for conception, He opened the way <I>and made it</I> easy:-when He came forth in birth, He trod it and marked its miles.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is the peace of Thy Way!</I> </P>

<P>21. He chose the Prophets; they cleared the way for the people:-He sent the Apostles; they smoothed paths for the nations.-The snares of the Evil One were shamed, when feeble men cleared them away.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who made our paths plain!</I></P>

<P>22. The graven images blinded, their gravers in secret:-they grayed eyes on stone, and darkened the eyes of the soul.-Praise to Thy Birth that opened, the sight that was blinded.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who has restored sight!</I></P>

<P>23. Let women praise Her, the pure Mary,-that <I>as</I> in Eve their mother,-great was their reproach,-lo! in Mary their sister,-greatly magnified was their honour.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who sprang from women!</I></P>

<P>24. Let the nations praise Thy Birth, that they have gained eyes to see,-how their wine has made them reel; and they have seen their own humiliation?-They come to know themselves, and worship Him who has rescued them.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is He Who has taught repentance!</I></P>

<P>25. Its worship mankind-had spread everywhere:-Him Who is <I>to be</I> worshipped it sought not, that worship should be paid Him.-But He endured not-worshippers that err.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is He Who came down and is worshipped!</I></P>

<P>26. The gold of the idols worshipped Thee, that Thou didst treat it as alms; which availed not apart, for the uses of life.-It hasted to Thy purse, as it had hasted to the manger.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Whom Creation has loved!</I></P>

<P>27. The frankincense worshipped Thy Birth. which had served demons.-It sorrowed <I>then</I> in its vapour: it exulted when it saw its Lord.-Instead of <I>being</I> the incense of delusion, it was an oblation before God!</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is Thy Birth which is worshipped!</I></P>

<P>28. The myrrh worshipped Thee for itself, and for its kindred ointments.-The hands that bore its ointment, had anointed abominable graven images.-To Thee the perfume was sweet, from the anointing wherewith Mary anointed Thee.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is Thy savour which is sweet to us!</I></P>

<P>29. The gold that had been worshipped worshipped thee, when the magi offered it.-That which had been worshipped in molten images, gave worship to Thee.-With its worshippers it worshipped Thee, it confessed that Thou art He that is to be worshipped.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is He Who claimed worship for Himself!</I></P>

<P>30. The Evil One fled and his hosts, he that used to exult in the world.-In the high places they sacrificed heifers to him, in the gardens they slew bulls for him.-He swallowed up all creation, he filled his belly with prey.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who came and made him disgorge!</I></P>

<P>31. Of him the Lord said, that he had fallen from Heaven.-The Abhorred One had exalted himself; from his uplifting he has fallen. The foot of Mary has trod him down, who bruised Eve with his heel.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who by His Birth laid him low!</I></P>

<P>32. Chaldeans went about, in all places and led astray:-the preachers of delusion, were shamed through the world,-they were shamed and overcome,-by the preachers of truth.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be the Babe Whom they preached!</I></P>

<P>33. Sin had spread out, her nets for the draught.-Praise <I>be</I> to Thy Birth that captured, the nets of delusion.-The soul took flight on high, which had been taken in the deep.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who prepared for us wings!</I></P>

<P>34. His Will was able, even by force to rescue us.-But since <I>it was</I> not force that made us guilty, it was not by force He purged us.-The Evil One by enticement enslaved us: Thy Birth enticed to give us life.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who planned and gave us life!</I> </P>

<P>35. The creatures complained that they were worshipped; in silence they sought release.-The All-Releaser heard, and because He endured it not He came down,-put on <I>the form of</I> a servant in the womb, came forth, set free Creation.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who made his Creation his gain!</I></P>

<P>36. Mercy was kindled on high, at the voice of Creation that cried out:-Gabriel was sent; he came and gave tidings of Thy Conception.-When Thou camest to the Birth, Watchers gave tidings of thy coming forth.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be by Thy Worship above all!</I></P>

<P>37. For greater is the joy of the Birth than the Conception.-Yea it was one angel, that brought us tidings of Thy Conception:-<I>but</I> in the joy of Thy Birth, a multitude of Watchers brought tidings.</P>

<P><I> R., Blessed be Thy tidings in Thy day!</I></P>

<P>38. Glory to Thee I too in Thy day, will offer, O Thou that art worshipped!-Take of the fruit that is mine; and give me mercy which is Thine!-For if the evil that is in me gives gifts, how much more shalt Thou give Who art good!</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed is Thy wealth in Thy servant!</I></P>

<P>39. The two things Thou soughtest, in Thy Birth have been done for us.-Our visible body Thou hast put on; Thy invisible might we have put on:-our body has become Thy clothing; Thy Spirit has become our robe.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who has been adorned and has adorned us!</I></P>

<P>40. Height and depth were amazed, that Thy Birth subdued the rebels.-For that we gave Thee hostages, Thou gavest us the Paraclete:-when the hostages went up from us, the Captain of the host came down to us.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who look away and sent down!</I></P>

<P>41. Come ye mouths of all and pour forth, and be in the likeness of waters, and wells of voices! May the Holy Spirit come,-and sing glory through us all, to the Father Who has redeemed us through His Son!</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He above all in His Birth!</I>XVI.(Resp.-<I>Glory to all of Thee from all of us!</I> (bis.)</P>

<P>1. Who then that is mortal man, can declare concerning the All-Life giver,-Who quilted the height of His Majesty, and abased Himself to humility?-<I>Thou</I> Who exaltest all in Thy Birth, exalt my weak mind,-to declare of Thy Birth; not that I should search out Thy Majesty,-but that I should proclaim Thy grace.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who conceals and reveals in His discourses!</I></P>

<P>2. It is a great marvel that the Son, dwelt wholly in a body;-abode therein wholly and it sufficed for Him; dwelt therein though not bounded <I>thereby</I>.-His Will was wholly therein; His bounds reached wholly to His Father.-Who is sufficient to tell, how though He dwelt wholly in a body.-He likewise dwelt wholly in all?</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who though without bounds was bounded!</I></P>

<P>3. Thy Majesty is concealed from us; Thy Grace is revealed before us.-I will be silent, O Lord of Thy Majesty; and I will tell of Thy grace.-Thy grace clove to Thee, and bowed Thee down to our vileness:-Thy grace made Thee a babe; Thy grace made Thee man:-it straitened, it enlarged, Thy Majesty.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be the might that became little and became great!</I></P>

<P>4. Glory to Him Who became lowly, though lofty He was by His nature!-He became in His love the firstborn of Mary, Firstborn though He be of Godhead.-He became in name the offspring of Joseph, offspring though He be of the Most High.- He became by His own Will man, God though He be by His Nature.-Glorified <I>be</I> Thy Will and Thy Nature!</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be Thy Glory which put on our image!</I></P>

<P>5. Yea, O Lord, Thy Birth, has become mother of <I>all</I> creatures; for it travailed anew and gave birth, to mankind which gave birth to Thee. Thou wast born of it bodily; it was born of Thee spiritually.-All that Thou camest <I>for</I> to birth, <I>was</I> that man might be born in Thy likeness.-Thy Birth became the author of birth to all.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who became a youth and to all gave youth!</I></P>

<P>6. When man's hope had broken down, hope was increased by Thy Birth.-Good tidings of hope they bore, the Heavenly Ones to men.-Satan who cut off our hope, his own hope by his own hands had cut off.-when he saw that hope was increased: Thy Birth became to the hopeless,-a fountain teaming with hope.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who bore the tidings of hope!</I></P>

<P>7. The day of Thy Birth is like Thee, for it is desired and loved as Thou.-We who saw not Thy Birth, and its flame as in its own time,-in this Thy day we see Thee, even as Thou wast a babe;-beloved by all men, lo! in Thee the Churches rejoice;-Thy day adorns and is adorned.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be Thy day which was ordained for us!</I></P>

<P>8. Thy day has given us a gift, to which the Father has none other like;-It was not Seraphim He sent us, nor yet did Cherubim come down among us;-there came not Watchers <I>or</I> Ministers, but the Firstborn to Whom they minister.-Who can suffice to give thanks, that the Majesty which is beyond measure-is laid in the lowly manger!</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who gave us what He had won!</I></P>

<P>9. That generation Thy Birth made glad, and our generation Thy day makes glad: twofold <I>was</I> the happiness of that generation, for they saw Thy Birth and also Thy day:-less <I>is</I> the happiness of them that come after, for the day of Thy Birth they see only.-Yet because they that then were, doubted, greater is the happiness of them that comeafter,-who though they have not seen Thee have believed in Thee.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be Thy happiness that is added to us!</I>10. The Magi exalted from afar; the Scribes murmured near at hand;-the prophet showed his message, and Herod his wrath;-the scribes showed their doctrine, the Magi showed their offerings. It is a marvel that to Him, the Babe, they of His own house hasted with their swords, and they that were strangers with their offerings.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be Thy Birth which has stirred up all!</I></P>

<P>11. The bosom of Mary amazes me, that it sufficed for Thee, Lord, and embraced Thee.-All creation were too small, to conceal Thy Majesty;-Heaven and earth too narrow, to be in the likeness of wings,<SUP><A HREF="#P3056_1046572">2</A></SUP> to cover Thy Godhead.-Too small for Thee was the bosom of earth; great enough for Thee was the bosom of Mary.-He dwelt in the bosom and healed in her bosom.</P>

<P> <I>R.,</I></P>

<P>12. He was wrapped meanly in swaddling clothes, and offerings were offered Him.-He put on garments in youth, and from them there came forth helps: He put on the waters of baptism, and from them there shone forth beams:-He put on linen cloths in death, and in them were shown forth triumphs; with His humiliations. His exaltations.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who joined His Glory to His Passion!</I></P>

<P>13. All these <I>are</I> the changes of raiment, which Mercy put off and put on,-when He strove to put on Adam, the glory which he had put off.-He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes as <I>Adam</I> with leaves; and clad in garments instead of skins.-He was baptized for <I>Adam's</I> sin, and buried for <I>Adam's</I> death:-He rose and raised <I>Adam</I> into Glory.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who came down and clothed him and went up!</I> </P>

<P>14. Though Thy Birth had sufficed, for Adam's sons as for Adam;-O Mighty One Who didst become a babe, in Thy Birth anew hast Thou begotten me!-O pure One Who wast baptized, let Thy Washing wash away our filth-O Living One who wastburied, may we gain life in Thy death!-I will praise all of Thee in Him that fills all.</P>

<P> <I>R., Glory to all of Thee from all of us!</I></P>

<P>XVII.(Resp., <I>Praise to Thee from every mouth on this Day of Thy Birth!</I>)</P>

<P>1. Infants were slain because of Thy Birth, Thou Giver of life to all-But because He Who was slain was a King, our Lord the Lord of Kingdoms,-the tyrant in subtlety, gave for Him slain hostages,-clad in the mysteries of His slaying: the ranks ofheaven received,-the hostages that they of earth offered.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be the Kingwho magnified Him!</I></P>

<P>2. All the Kings of the house of David, transmitted and hauled on each to each,-the throne and crown of the Son of David, as guardian of a deposit.-In one they reached their bound and limit, when He came, the Lord of all things,-and took awayfrom them all things, and cut off the transmission of all things. ...</P>

<P> R., Blessed be He Who is clad in that which is His!</P>

<P>3. The doves moaned in Bethlehem, that the serpent destroyed their offspring.-The eagle betook himself to Egypt, to go down and receive the promises.-Egypt rejoiced in Him that there came, abundance for payment of debts,-which had failed thesons of Joseph. Among the sons of Joseph He laboured and paid-the debts of thesons of Joseph.</P>

<P> R., Blessed is He Who called Him out or Egypt!</P>

<P>4. The Scribes read daily, that the Star arises out of Jacob.-For the People were the Voice and the reading, for the nations the rising of the Star and the interpretation:-for them were the Books and for us the facts; for them boughs and for us fruits.-The Scribes read in things written; the Magi saw in things done, the outshining of that which was read.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who added to us their books!</I></P>

<P>5. Who is able to tell, of the withdrawal and the appearings,-of the shining star that went, before the bearers of the offerings?-It appeared and proclaimed the crown; it was hid and concealed <I>His</I> Body.-It was for the Son in twofold wise, herald and guardian;-it guarded His Body, it proclaimed His Crown.</P>

<P><I> R., Blessed is He Who has given wisdom to them that proclaim Him!</I></P>

<P>6. The tyrant gazed on the Magi, as they asked "Where is the son of the King?"-While his heart was gloomy, he sought for himself a cheerful countenance.-With the sheep he sent wolves, that should kill the Lamb of God.-The Lamb went down to Egypt, that thence He might judge them,-whence He had saved them.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who yet again subdued them.</I></P>

<P>7. The Magi declared to the tyrant, "When thy servants joined us,-the bright star withdrew itself, yea the paths hid themselves."-The blessed ones knew not, that the king had sent bitter <I>foes</I>,-murderers as <I>if </I>worshippers, to destroy the sweet fruit,-whereof the bitter eat and are made sweet.</P>

<P><I> R., To Thee be glory, Medicine of life!</I>8. When there the Magi received, commandment to go and seek Him.-it is written of them that they saw, that bright star and rejoiced.-<I>Thus</I> it is known that it had been withdrawn; therefore rejoiced they at its aspect.-It was hid and hindered the murderers, it arose and called the worshippers;-it overthrew a part and it called a part.</P>

<P> <I>R., Blessed be He Who has triumphed in both parts!</I>9. The abhorred one who slew the children, how did he overlook the Child?-Justice hindered him that he thought, the Magi would return to him.-While he stayed waiting to seize, the Worshipped and His worshippers,-everything escaped his hands, the offerings and the worshippers took flight,-from the tyrant to the Son of the King.</P>

<P><I>R., Glory to Him who knows all counsels!</I></P>

<P>10. The blameless Magi as they slept, meditated on their beds:-sleep became a mirror, and a dream rose <I>on it</I> as light.-The murderer they saw and trembled, as his guile and his sword flashed forth.-He taught the men guile, he sharpened the sword to sharpness:-the Watcher taught the sleepers.</P>

<P><I> R., Blessed is He who gives prudence to the simple!</I></P>

<P>11. The simple who believe have known, two Comings of Christ:-but the foolish scribes have not even perceived one Coming.-Yet the nations have life in the first, and shall rise again there in the second.-The People whose mind is blinded, the first Coming has dispersed;-the second shall blot out their memory.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be the King Who is come and is to come!</I></P>

<P>12. When the Saviour arose as the blind, the Sun showed forth his beams,-and they were clothed in darkness: the Brightness sent forth his light,-and He brought the sons of the stars, to make manifest the sons of darkness.-For lo! among you is the star, but on your eyes the veil.</P>

<P> <I>R., To Thee be glory, newborn Sun!</I></P>

<P>13. Prophets declared concerning His Birth, but they made not plain the time thereof.-He sent the Magi, and they came and showed of its time.-Yet the Magi who made known the time, made not plain who the Child <I>should be</I>.-A star of splendid light, in its course showed who the Child was,-<I>how</I> splendid was <I>His</I> lineage.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who by them all was pointed out!</I></P>

<P>14. They scorned the trumpet of Isaiah, which sounded forth His pure Conception,-they silenced the lute of the Psalms, which sang of His Priesthood;-the harp of the Spirit they hushed, which sang again of His Kingdom;-under deep silence they closed up, the great Birth that joined the cry-of them above with them below.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who appeared in the midst of silence!</I></P>

<P>15. His voice was the secret key that opened the mouths of the Magi.-Whereas preachers were silent in Judah, they made their voice sound through creation;-and the Gospel which those had scorned, these who came from far took and departed.-The scorners began to hear their <I>own</I> orders from strangers, who cried out <I>the name of</I> the Son of David.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who by our voice has put them to silence!</I>16. Whereas the People scorned offerings, and brought them not to Him the Son of the King,-He sent His herald to the nations, and caused them to come with theirofferings:-yet not all of them caused He to come, for it could not suffice for them,-the narrow bosom of Bethlehem; but the bosom of Holy Church,-enlarged itself and contained her children.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed be He Who has made the barren fruitful!</I></P>

<P>17. The slayers of Bethlehem mowed down the tender flowers that among them-should perish the tender seedling, wherein was hidden the Bread of life.-But the ear of corn that has life had escaped, that it should come to the sheaves in harvest:-the grape that escaped when young, gave itself to the treading,-that its wine might give life to souls.</P>

<P><I>R., Glory to Thee, Treasury of life!</I></P>

<P>18. The murderers went into a paradise, full of tender fruits:-they shook off the flowers from the bough, blossoms and buds they destroyed,-unblemished oblations he offered, the persecutor unwittingly.-To him woe, but to them blessing! Bethlehemwas first to give, virgin fruits to the Holy One.</P>

<P><I>R., Blessed is He Who receives the first fruits!</I>19. The Scribes were silenced in envy, the Pharisees in jealousy.-Men of stone cried out and gave praise, who had a heart of stone.-They applauded in presence of the Stone, the rejected that has become the Head.-Stones were made flesh by that Stone, and obtained mouths to speak; stones cried out through that Stone.</P>

<P><I>R.,Blessed be Thy Birth that has caused stones to cry out!</I></P>

<P>20. The Star that is written in Scripture, the nations beheld from afar,-that the People might be shamed which is near; O People instructed and puffed up! which by the nations hast been in turn instructed, how and where they saw,-that vision whereof Balaam spake; a stranger he who spread abroad concerning it,-strangers they who saw it.</P>

<P><I> R., Blessed is He Who has provoked to jealousy them of His own house!</I></P>

<P>21. Let my supplication draw nigh to Thy Door, yea my poverty to Thy Treasury! -Give to me my Lord without measure, as God unto man!-And though Thou increase gifts as Son of the Blessed, and though Thou add to them as Son of the King;-though I be thankless as <I>are all</I> creatures of dust, as Adam <I>so is</I> the son of Adam,-and as the Blessed <I>so</I> too <I>is</I> the Son of the Blessed.</P>

<P><I>R., Praise be to Thee Who art like unto Thy Father!</I>XVIII.Resp.-<I>Praise be to Him Who sent Him!</I> (bis)</P>

<P>1. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, for lo! in thee is the sound,-of the great feast the festival of the King!-Sion is deserted, her gates are sore athirst,-and forsaken of festivals.-Blessed thy gates that are open yet not filled,-and thy halls that are enlarged yet suffice not!-In the midst of thee lo! is the sound, of the nations that cry out, and have put to silence the People.</P>

<P>2. <I>Blessed art</I> then, O Church, that in thy festivals,-the Watchers rejoice amid thy festivity!-for one night the Watchers gave praise,-on the earth which withheld and refused praise.-<I>Blessed</I> thy voices that have been sown and reaped,-and in Heaven stored up in garners!-Thy mouth is a censer, and thy voices as perfumes, breathing vapour in thy festivals.</P>

<P>3. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, that all oblations,-are brought unto thee in this feast.-The Magi once among traitors, offered them to the Truth.-<I>Blessed</I> thy abode that He bowed Himself and dwelt therein, Son of the King Who is worshipped with gifts!-Gold from the West, and spices from the East,-are offered in Thy Festivals.</P>

<P>4. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, that there is not with thee,-a tyrant King slayer of babes! for he killed in Bethlehem the little ones at random,-that he might put to death the Child that gives life to all.-<I>Blessed</I> thy children that are envied and worshipped,-by Kings, for those are promised for Thy worship,-the crowns of the East:-he who trod down thy dear ones, shall be trodden down by thy beloved.</P>

<P>5. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, for lo! over thee,-Isaiah too exults in his prophecy,-"Lo a Virgin shall conceive and bear,-a Son" Whose name is great mystery!-O interpretation revealed in the Church!-two names that were joined and became one;-"Emmanuel,"-God be with thee ever, Who joined thee with His members!</P>

<P>6. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, in Micah who cried out,-" A Shepherd shall come forth from Ephrata":-for He came to Bethlehem to take-from thence the rod of Jesse and to rule the nations.-<I>Blessed</I> thy lambs that are sealed with His seal,-and thy sheep that are kept by His sword!-Thou art, O Church,-the abiding Bethlehem,-for in thee is the Bread of Life!<SUP><A HREF="#P3109_1057953">3</A></SUP> 7. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, for lo! in thee rejoices,-Daniel also the man beloved, -who foretold that the glorious Messiah shall be killed,-and the city of holiness be laid desolate at His killing!-Woe to the People that was rejected and is not converted-<I>Blessed</I> the nations that were called and turned not away!-The bidden guests refused,-and others in their stead enjoyed their banquet.</P>

<P>8. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, for on thy, lute, lo! King David sings psalms in thee! In the Spirit he sings of Him "Thou <I>art</I> My Son and I-this day have begotten Thee" in the glories of holiness.-<I>Blessed</I> thy ears that have been purged to hearHis day watch thou as His Body and call on Him;-be taught by Sion,-which saddened His Feast; make Him glad Who has gladdened thee.</P>

<P>9. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, that all festivals-have taken flight from Sion and sheltered with thee!-In the midst of thee the wearied Prophets have found rest,-from the labour and the reproach<I> they bore</I> in Judah.-<I>Blessed</I> the books unrolled in thy temples,-and the festivals celebrated in thy shrines!-Sion <I>is</I> forsaken,-and lo! today the nations shout in thy festivals.</P>

<P>10. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, O Church, in ten blessings,-which our Lord has given <I>as</I> a mystery complete:-for on ten all the numbers hang, therefore art thou perfect by ten blessings.-Blessed thy crowns that are twined-with all blessings mixed in every crown!-O blessed one,-with every blessing crowned, on me too send thy blessing!</P>

<P>11. <I>Blessed art</I> thou, Ephrata, mother of Kings, that from thee sprang the Lord of diadems!-Micah gave thee tidings that He is from everlasting, and the span of His times is not comprehended.-Blessed thine eyes which first of all discerned Him!-thee He deemed worthy to see Him when He appeared,-Chief of benediction,-and Beginning of gladness, thou didst receive first of all.</P>

<P>12. Blessed <I>art</I> thou, Bethlehem, that the towns envy thee,-and the fortified cities!-As they <I>envy</I> thee, <I>so</I> the women envy Mary,-and the virgins daughters of princes.-Blessed the maiden in whom He deigned to abide,-and the city wherein He deigned to sojourn;-a poor maiden,-and a small city, He chose Him to humble Himself.</P>

<P>13. Blessed <I>art </I>thou, Bethlehem, that in thee was the beginning,-for Him the Son Who from everlasting is in the Father!-It is hard to comprehend, that before Time He is,-Who in thee made Himself subject to Time.-Blessed thine ears, for in thee first was heard the cry-of the Lamb of God who exulted in thee!-Narrow though thy manger,-He spread Himself on all sides, and was worshipped of every creature.</P>

<P>14. Blessed <I>art </I>thou too, Mary, that thy name-is great and exalted because of thy child!-Thou canst tell then how and how long-and where He dwelt in thee, the great One in small room.-Blessed thy mouth that praised and enquired not,-and thy tongue that glorified and questioned not!-For His Mother was uncertain concerning Him,-even while she carried Him <I>in the womb</I>; who then shall suffice <I>to comprehend</I> Him?</P>

<P>15. O Woman, thou whom no man knew,-how can we behold the Son thou hast borne?-For no eyes suffice to stand-before the transfigurations of the glory, that is on Him.-For tongues of fire abide in Him-Who sent tongues by His Ascension.-Be every tongue warned,-that our questioning is <I>as</I> stubble, and <I>as</I> fire our scrutiny.</P>

<P>16. Blessed <I>is</I> he the priest who in the sanctuary,-offers to the Father the Son of the Father,-the fruit that is plucked from our tree, though it be wholly of the <I>Divine</I> Majesty!-Blessed the hands that are hallowed and offer Him!-and the lips that are spent in kissing Him!-The Spirit in the Temple-longed for His embrace; and at His Crucifixion rent <I>the veil</I> and went forth.</P>

<P>17. The Archangel gave thee greeting,-as the earnest of holiness-Earth became to him new Heavens,-when the Watcher came down and sang glory on it.-The sons of the Highest encompassed thy habitation-because of the Son of the King that dwelt in thee.-Thy abode below,-to the Heaven above was made like by the host of Watchers.XIX.(Resp.-<I>Blessed be thy Birth that gladdens all creatures!</I>)</P>

<P>1. The first year wherein, our Saviour was born,-is source of blessing, and ground of life;-for by it are borne,-manifold triumphs, the sum of all help:-as the first day of "the beginning,"-the great pillar of all creatures,-bears the building of Creation;-so the year of the Firstborn <I>bears</I> help for man.</P>

<P>2. In the second year, of our Saviour's Birth,-the Magi exult, the Pharisees mourn:-treasures are opened,-kings are hastening, and infants are slain.-For in it are offered in Bethlehem,-oblations precious and terrible;-for while love made offering of gold,-hatred offered infants by the sword.</P>

<P>3. The day of the All-Lightening, exults in His birth;-a pillar of radiance, which drives away, by its beams-the works of darkness. After the type of that day, wherein light was created,-and sundered the darkness that spread-over the fair beauty of Creation;-the radiance of our Saviour's birth-came in to sunder the darkness that <I>was</I> on the heart.</P>

<P>4. The first day the source and the beginning,-orders the roots, to make all things grow.-Our Saviour's day-is praised far above it, a tree planted in the world.-For His Death is as the root in the earth; His Resurrection as the head in heaven; on all sides His words <I>reach</I> as boughs; likewise His Body as fruit for the eaters.</P>

<P>5. Let the second day, sing praise to the Birth-of the second Son, and His voice which first-commanded the firmament and it was made,-divided the waters that <I>were</I> above, and gathered the seas that <I>were</I> under.-He Who divided waters from waters, divided Himself from the Watchers and came down to man.-For the waters which at His command were gathered.-He cleft the fountain of life and gave drink.</P>

<P>6. Let the third day weave with divers hymns-the crown of psalms and with one voice present it-for His Birth who gave growth-of buds and flowers, on the third day.-But now He the All-giver of growth,-has come down and become the All-holy Flower; from the thirsting earth has sprang forth and gone up,-that he may decorate and crown the conquerors.</P>

<P>7. Let the fourth day praise, first among the four,-His Birth Who created as the fourth day-the two lightgivers,-which fools worship, and are sightless and blind.-The Lord of Lightgivers has come down,-and from the womb has shone on us as the Sun.-His splendours have opened the eyes of the blind:-His rays have given light to the wandering.</P>

<P>8. Let the fifth day laud Him Who created-on the fifth day creeping things and Dragons-of whose kind is the serpent.-He deceived with guile our mother, a maid void of counsel.-The deceiver who had mocked the maid,-by the Dove was exposed as false,-which from a virgin bosom sprang, and came forth-the Wise that trod down the crafty.</P>

<P>9. Let the sixth day laud Him who created-on Vesper-day Adam, whom Satan envied; as a feigned friend-cheered him in offering poison in his food.-The medicine of life reached them both,-put on a body and came near to both.-The mortal tasted Him and lived through Him;-the devourer who ate Him was left void.</P>

<P>10. Let the seventh day hallow the Holy One,-Who halloweth the Sabbath, and gave rest to all that live.-The Blessed One Who wearied not-has care for mankind, and has care for the beasts.-When Freedom fell under the yoke,-He came to the Birth and became bond to make it free:-He was smitten on the face by servants in the judgment hall;-He broke the yoke that <I>was</I> on the free, as Lord.</P>

<P>11. Let the eighth day, which circumcised the Hebrews,-praise Him Who commanded his namesake Joshua-to circumcise with a flint-the people circumcised in body, while the heart was profane within.-Lo! as the eighth day, as a Babe,-to circumcision He came Who circumcises all.-Though the sign of Abraham <I>is</I> on His Flesh,-the blind daughter of Sion had defiled it.</P>

<P>12. Let the tenth day sing, praises in its turn.-For <I>God</I> the <I>first </I>letter of Jesus (goodly name!), is ten in numbering.-He Who <I>is</I> as a lamb, turns back the numbers.-For when the number goes up to ten, it is turned back to begin again from one. O great mystery of that which is in Jesus, Whose might turns all creation back again!</P>

<P>13. The All-Purifier Firstborn in the day of His purifying,-purified the purification of the firstborn and was offered<SUP><A HREF="#P3133_1066215">4</A></SUP> <I>in the Temple</I>:-the Lord of offering needed offerings,-to make offering of birds.-In His Birth were fulfilled the types,-in His purification and circumcision the allegories.-He came and paid over debts in His coming down;-in His Resurrection He went up and sent down treasures.</P>
