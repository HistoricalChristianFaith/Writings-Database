<p>Behold, I am writing willingly something that I did not wish to write. For I
did not wish that a letter should pass between us, since it cannot ask or be
asked questions ; but I had wished that there might pass between us a discourse
from mouth to ear, asking and being asked questions. The written document is the
image of the composite body, just as also the free tongue is the likeness of the
free mind. For the body cannot add or subtract anything from the measure of its
stature, nor can a document add to or subtract from the measure of its writing.
But a word-of-mouth discourse can be within the measure or without the measure.</p>

<p>For the Deity gave us Speech that is free like Itself, in order that free
Speech might serve our independent Freewill. And by Speech, too, we are the
likeness of the Giver of it, [Ov. p. 22.] inasmuch as by means of it we have
impulse and thought for good things; and not only for good things, but we learn <A HREF="#ii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ii</SPAN></A>
also of God, the fountain of good things, by means of Speech (which is) a
gift from Him. For by means of this (faculty) which is like God we are clothed
with the likeness of God. For divine teaching is the seal of minds, by means of
which men who learn are sealed that they may be an image for Him Who knows all.
For if by Freewill Adam was the image of God, it is a most praiseworthy thing
when, by true knowledge, and by true conduct, a man becomes the image of God.
For that independence exists in these also. For animals cannot form in
themselves pure thoughts about God, because they have, not Speech, that which
forms in us the image of the Truth. We have received the gift of Speech that we
may not be as speechless animals in our conduct, but that we may in our actions
resemble God, the giver of Speech. How great is Speech, a gift which came to
make those who receive it like its Giver ! And because animals have not Speech
they cannot be the likeness of our minds. But because the mind has Speech, it is
a great disgrace to it when it is not clothed with the likeness of God ; it is a
still more grievous shame when animals resemble men, and men do not resemble
God. But threefold is the torture doubled when this intermediate (party between
God and animals) forsakes the Good above him and degrades himself from his
natural rank to put on the likeness of animals in his conduct.</p>

<p>A letter, therefore, cannot demonstrate every matter about which a man is
seeking to ask questions, because the tongue of the [Ov. p. 23, 1. 2.] letter is far away from
it,&#8212;its tongue is the pen of the writer of it. Moreover, when the letter
speaks anything written in it, it takes to itself another tongue that the letter
may speak with it, (the letter) which silently speaks with two mute tongues, one
being the ink-pen, the other, the sight of the (reader's) eye. But if we thus
rejoice over a letter poor in treasures, how much more shall we rejoice over a
tongue which is near us, the lord and treasurer of the treasures within !

<p>But I had desired that instead of your seeing me in the characters of a
document, you might have seen me in the characters of the countenance ; and
instead of the writing of <A HREF="#iii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|iii</SPAN></A> my letter thus seeing you, I had desired that my eyes instead of my writings
might see you. But because the sight of our face is not worthy of the pure gaze
of your eyes, behold you are gazing on the characters of our letter. But justly
pure writings have met your pure eyes ; not that I say that the pure is profaned
by the defiled, but it is not right that pure eyes should look at what is riot
pure. For even though the People had sanctified their bodies three days, (yet)
because they had not sanctified their hearts he did not allow them to approach
the holy Mountain, not that holiness would be profaned by those who were
defiled, but those who were defiled were not worthy to approach holiness. [Exod, xix. 10 ff.]
But by
Moses, the holy one, who went up into the holy Mountain, God gave an instance
for the consolation of the pure and for the refutation of the defiled, (showing)
that all those who are holy like Moses are near holiness like Moses. [Ov. p. 24.]
For when
one of the limbs of the body is satisfied all the limbs receive a pledge of
satisfaction, that they too will be satisfied together with that one in the same
manner. For by means of that body, too, in which our Lord was raised, all bodies
have received a pledge that they will be raised with it in like manner.

<p>But, my brother, in that thou didst stir up our littleness to approach you,
know that if I wished I could come, but know, too, that if I could come I would
not wish to be deprived (of the opportunity). For I could come if I had no
intelligence ; but I have been unable to come because I had intelligence. In

<p>And whoever is steeped in love like a child is above fear ; and whoever! is
timorously subject to fear vain terror always tortures him. It helps athletes
too in a competition to be above fear through the encouragement of a good hope,
and not to fall under the sickly apprehensions which result from a timorous
habit of thought. Athletes perhaps (might) well fear because the victor is
crowned and the loser suffers shame, For they do not divide the victory between
the two of them.

<p>But we ought not to fear a struggle in which failure is <A HREF="#iv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|iv</SPAN></A>
victory ; since when the teacher wins the learner too is much helped. For
helper and helped are both partakers in the gain. If, then, we had come to teach
there would have been a common victory as Error would have been overwhelmed by
our Truth. [Ov. p. 25. l. 3.] But if we had been unable to teach, yet had been able to learn, there
would have been a common victory in that by your knowledge there would have been
an end of ignorance. The treasure of Him that enricheth every one is open before
every one, since Grace administers it, (Grace) that never restrains intelligent
inquirers. If, therefore, we had possessed something we could have bestowed it
as givers, or if we did not possess anything we could have received as
inquirers. But if we had not been able to give nor able even to receive, our
coming could not have been deprived of all good. For even if we could not have
searched you out with our mind yet we could have seen you with our eyes ; since
we have no greater gift than seeing you. [Ex. xxxiii. 18 ff.] But Moses testifies that while it was
granted to him to do everything like God, at last he abandoned everything and
prayed to see the Lord of all. For if the creatures of the Creator are thus
pleasant to look upon, how much more pleasant is their Creator to look upon ;
but because we have not an eye which is able to look upon His splendour, a mind
was given us which is able to contemplate His beauty. Man, therefore, is more
than his possessions, just as God is more excellent and more beautiful than His
creatures.

  <table align=left border="0" cellpadding="4" width="150">

  </table>
<p>But know, my beloved, that if we had come, it would not have been possible
for us to have been real paupers such as receive everything, nor again for you
to have been complete givers, to give everything. One who lacks is not lacking
in all respects, lest he should be abased ; neither is he who is complete,
complete in every respect, lest he should exalt himself. But this lack has
arisen that completeness may be produced by it. For in that we need to give to
one another and receive from one another, the wants of all of us are filled up
by the abundance of all. [Ov. p. 26, 1. 7.] For as the wants of the limbs of the body are filled up
<A HREF="#v"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|v</SPAN></A> one by the other, so also the inhabitants of the world fill up the common
need from the common abundance. Let us rejoice, therefore, in the need of all of
us, for in this way unity is produced for us all. For inasmuch as men are
dependent on one another, the high bend themselves down to the humble and are
not ashamed, while the lowly reach out towards the great and are not afraid. And
also in the case of animals we exercise great care over them on account of our
dependence on them, and obviously our need of everything binds us in love
towards everything. O hated Need ! yet much-loved unity is produced from it.
Because countries are dependent on one another, their dependence combines them
as into a body ; and like the limbs they give to one another and receive from
one another. But these arrangements of interdependence belong to one rich
complete Being, Whose need is this&#8212;to give to everything though He has no need
to receive from anywhere. For even what He is thought to <i>receive </i>from us,
He takes it astutely from us in His love that He may again give it to us
manifold more as the rewarder. This is that astuteness which ministers good
things, and our craftiness which ministers evil things should resemble it.
</p>
  <table align=left border="0" cellpadding="4" width="150">
    <tr>
      <td><font size="1">I said above that I refrained from coming through fear. Such fear even S.
Peter experienced.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>But as regards that fear of which we spoke above, not only upon us weak ones
does the constraint of fear fall, but even upon the heroes and valiant
themselves. Nor have I said this in order to find comfort for our folly, but
that we might remind thy wisdom. For when Peter despised fear and was wishing to
walk upon the waters, although he was going (thither) on account of his love
which was making him run, yet he was nigh to sinking on account of fear which
fell upon him ; and the fear which was weaker than he on dry land, when it came
among the waves into a place in which it was strengthened became powerful
against him and overcame him. [Ov. p. 27, l. 13.] From this it is possible to learn that when any
one of all the desires in us is associated with an evil habit which helps it,
then that desire acquires power and conquers us. For fear and love were weighed
in the midst of the sea as in a balance, and fear turned the scale and won ; and
that Simon whose faith was lacking <A HREF="#vi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|vi</SPAN></A> and rose in the balance was himself nigh to sinking in the midst of the sea.
And this type is a teacher for us, that is to say, it is a fear-inspiring sign
that all those whose good things fail and are light when rightly weighed, are
themselves nigh to sinking into evil. But if any one say :&#8212;why is it necessary
to frame illustrations of this kind, let him know that this may not be harmful
if we receive from everything some helpful lesson for our weakness. [Ov. p. 28.]
If,
therefore, Peter was afraid of the waves, though the Lord of the waves was
holding his hand, how much more should weak ones fear the waves of Controversy,
which are much stronger than the waves of the sea! For in the waves of the sea
(only) bodies are drowned, but in the waves of Investigation minds sink or are
rescued.

<p>But, again, that Publican also who was praying in the Temple was very
importunate about forgiveness, because he was much afraid of punishment. He was
in a state of fear and love ; he both verily loved the Merciful One on account
of His forgiveness, and he verily feared the Judge on account of His vengeance.
And though, on the one hand, he was praying in love because of his affection,
yet, on the other hand, because of his fear he would not dare to lift up his
eyes unto Heaven. And though Grace was urging him forward, his fear was unable
to cross boldly the limit of justice.

      <td><font size="1">Such fear may be a gain.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>If the fear of the Publican who was justified knew its measure and did not
exalt itself to cross the limit, how can weakness dare to neglect the measure
and to cross the limit of propriety ? For this also (is said) that a man may
know the degree of his weakness and not exalt himself to a degree above his
power. I think that such a man cannot slip. For he does not run to a degree too
hard for him and so receive thence a fall. For without knowledge men run to
degrees too hard for them ; and before they go up pride urges them on, and after
they fall penitence of soul tortures them.

    <tr>
      <td><font size="1">On the other hand,the Lord gave a Parable of unabashed importunity.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>But, again, indeed, I see that that importunity about which our Lord spake
was praised and enriched because its importunate nature ventured to cross the
limit of propriety ; for if it had been abashed and observed propriety, it would
have gone empty away, but because it was presumptuous and trampled down <A HREF="#vii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|vii</SPAN></A>
harmful modesty as with its heels, [Ov. p. 29, l. 5.] it received more than it had asked. O
Necessity, whose importunate words enriched its destitution! For it does not aid
necessity to be subject to harmful modesty, but (it is aided) by its importunity
being a good instrument for (securing) good things.
</p>
  <table align=left border="0" cellpadding="4" width="150">
    <tr>
      <td><font size="1">Better, therefore, is wholesome importunity, than a barren scrupulosity about
exact propriety.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>But if all these praises were bestowed on importunity, which opened closed
doors, and aroused those who were asleep in bed, and received more than was its
due, how must that indigence be censured which has not approached open doors nor
received help from the treasuries of the Rich One !<i> </i>Better, therefore, is
he who is importunate about his aid than he who is ashamed and loses his aid.
For whoever observes proper modesty while he loses his aid, even the propriety
which he has observed is in that case subject to censure, and propriety has
become impropriety. And he that seeks after exact propriety at all times is
neglectful of sound propriety. For from the best wheat, if it shed not much
bran, fine flour cannot be made ; for unripe fruit is not palatable, and what is
over ripe loses flavour, or else its taste is pungent, or bad.

    <tr>

    </tr>
  </table>
<p>For if we refine things much beyond what is proper, even the fine and the
pure are also rejected. For it is not right for us to cultivate Ignorance, or
deep Investigation, but Intelligence between-these-two-extremes, sound and true.
For by means of the two former a man surely misses his advantage. [Ov. p. 30, l. 3.]
For by means
of Ignorance a man cannot understand Knowledge, and by deep Investigation a man
cannot build on a sound foundation. For Ignorance is a veil which does not
permit one to see, and Investigation, which is continually building and
destroying, is a changeful wheel that knows not how to stand and be at rest; and
when it passes in its investigation over true things, it cannot abide by them ;
for it has unstable motions. When, therefore, it finds anything it seeks, it
does not retain its discovery, and is not rejoiced with the fruit of its toil
But if we inquire much into everything we are neglectful of the Lord of
everything, inasmuch as we desire to know all things like Him. And since our
Knowledge cannot know everything. <A HREF="#viii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|viii</SPAN></A>
we show our evil Will before Him Who knows all things. And while He is higher
than all in His Knowledge, the ignorant venture to assail the height of His
Knowledge. For if we are continually striving to comprehend things, by our
strife we desire to fence round the way of Truth and to confuse by our
Controversy things that are fair&#8212;not that those fair things are confused in
their own nature, but our weakness is confused by reason of the great things.
For we are not able completely to apprehend their greatness. For there is One
who is perfect in every respect, whose Knowledge penetrates completely through
all.
</p>
  <table align=left border="0" cellpadding="4" width="150">
    <tr>
      <td><font size="1">It is not good for us to seek deep Knowledge : for deep
        things are unknowable. See how <i>Simplicity </i>is better than <i>Cleverness.</i></font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>But it is not right for us to look at all things minutely, but rather
simply&#8212;not that our Knowledge is to be Ignorance; for even in the case of
something which a man does not do cleverly, if he does the thing with clever
discrimination then his lack of Cleverness is Cleverness. And if, by his
Knowledge he becomes an ignorant man so that he ignores those things which he
cannot know, even his Ignorance is great Knowledge. For because he knows that
they are not known, his Knowledge cannot be Ignorance. For he knows well
whatever he knows. But the mind in which many doubts spring up, destroying one
another, cannot do anything readily. For thoughts, vanquishing and vanquished,
are produced by it, and the waves which from all sides beat upon it, fix it in
doubt and inaction. [Ov. p. 31, l. 12.] But it is an advantage that the scale of simplicity should
outweigh in us the scale of wrangling-logic. For how many times, in consequence
of the clever and subtle thoughts which we have concerning a matter, that very
matter is delayed so as not to be accomplished! And consider that in the case of
those matters which keep the world alive, Simplicity accomplishes them without
many thoughts. For these matters succeed when a single thought controls them,
and they stand still when many thoughts rush in. For there is only a single
thought in Husbandry, that is (the thought) that in a simple manner it should
scatter the seed in the earth. But if other thoughts occurred to it so that it
pondered and reasoned as to whether the seed was sprouting or not, or whether
the earth would fail to produce it, or would restore it again, then Husbandry
could not sow. For morbid thoughts spring up against a single <A HREF="#ix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ix</SPAN></A>
sound thought, and weaken it. And because a thing is weakened, it cannot work
like a sound thing. For the soundness of a [Ov. p. 32.] thought like the
soundness of a body performs everything. And the husbandman who cannot plough
with one ox cannot plough with two thoughts. Just as it is useful to plough with
two oxen, so it is right to employ one healthy thought.
</p>
  <table align=left border="0" cellpadding="4" width="150">

    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Moreover, if the martyrs and confessors who have been crowned had approached
with double thoughts they could not have been crowned. For when our Freewill is
in a strait between keeping the commandment and breaking the commandment, it is
usually the case that it is seeking two reasonings destructive of one another,
so that by means of the. interpretation of one reasoning it may flee from the
pain of the other, that is to say, (it argues) in order that by a false excuse
it may cast away the burden of the commandment. Now, without wandering after
those things which are unnecessary, or omitting anything that is necessary, let
us say in brief and not at length, that if anything succeeds by means of a
single sound thought, its soundness is weakened by many thoughts. For if we
approach with polished wiles any matter which we ought to approach in a simple
way, then our intelligence becomes non-intelligence. For in the case of every
duty, whenever a man proceeds beyond what is its due, all the ingenuities which
he can devise about it, are foolish. So (too) in the case of any investigation
in which the investigator slips from its truth, all the discoveries he may make,
although his discoveries may be clever, are false. For everything which is
clever is not true ; but whatever is true is clever. And whatever is debated is
not deep, but whatever is said by God is subtle when it is believed. But there
is no subtlety equal to [Ov. p. 33.] this, that everything should be duly done
in its own way, and if it happen that what is to be done can be done simply, its
simplicity is subtlety. For it is all the more fitting that we should call this
simplicity subtlety in that it accomplishes helpful things without many
combinations and reasonings. For in that it does things easily it resembles
Deity, Who easily creates everything.

  </table>
<p>It is right, therefore, that we should investigate well the advantage of
things by an examination of them ; and if they are <A HREF="#x"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|x</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
judged by the investigators to be simple, there are many things which are
thought to be obviously unsuccessful, but their unseen qualities achieve a great
victory. For there is nothing that appears more simple than this, that the
husbandman should take and scatter in the earth the gathered seeds which he
holds in his hands. But, after a time, when it is seen that the scattered seed
has been gathered and has come with a multitude like a general with his army,
and that the seed which had been regarded as lost is found and finds also other
(seeds) with it, then a man marvels at the husbandman's simplicity, which has
become a fountain of cleverness. Therefore, with regard to this very thing, hear
on the other hand the opposite of it, that if a man spare the gathered seed, so
as not to scatter it, he is thought indeed to act prudently in refraining from
scattering. But when we see the husbandman's scattered investment collected in
the principal and interest, and the earth rewarding him, then the intelligence
which refrained from scattering is seen to be [Ov. p. 34.] blindness, because it is deprived of (the chance of) gathering.
Therefore, it is not an advantage to us that we should always be led astray by
names, nor that we should be deceived by outward appearances.

venture to come, I did not come for that reason, perhaps it would have been
better for me if I had not wisely discerned. For, perhaps, my coming to thee in
childlike and simple fashion would have met with success. But know again that if
I had come recklessly I would not have wished to come, because our coming would
have been indiscreet. For we should have had no fruit of intelligence. For
everything which is done indiscreetly belongs either to reckless habit, or blind
chance ; and it has no root in the mind of those who do it.

<p>But if these two wise conclusions (namely) that I should come and that I
should not come, (both) belong to my Will, this is a single Will of which one
half does battle with the other half, and when it conquers and is conquered it
is crowned in both cases. This is a wonder, that though the Will is one, two
opinions which are not homogeneous are found in its homogeneity. And I know that
what I have said is so, but why (it is so) I am not <A HREF="#xi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xi</SPAN></A>
able to demonstrate. For I wonder how that one thing both enslaves it and is
enslaved by it. But know that if this was not so mankind would have no free
power of Choice. For if Necessity makes us wish, we have no power of Choice. And
if, again, our Will is bound and has not the power to will and not to will we
have no Freewill. [<font size="1">&quot;The Will is both one and many.&quot;</font>]
And, therefore, necessity thus demands that there should be a
single thing, and though it is a single thing, when that single thing wills to
be two it is easy for it, and when again it wills to be one or many it is a
simple matter for it. For in a single day there are produced in us a great
number of Volitions which destroy each other. [Ov. p. 35, l. 5.] This Will is a root and parent; it
is both one and many. This Will brings forth sweet and bitter fruit. O free Root
with power over its fruit! For if it wills it makes its fruits bitter, and if it
wills it makes its products sweet. For God to Whom nothing is difficult has
created in us something which is difficult to explain, and that is, Freewill.
And though this (Will) is one, yet there are two opinions in it, that of willing
and that of being unwilling ; so that when half of it struggles with and
conquers the other half, then the whole of it is crowned by the whole of it. For
this is an unspeakable wonder, how, though the Will is one, half of it rebels
against the Law and half of it is subject to the Law. For, lo, there are in it
two opinions contending together, for part of the Will desires that Evil should
be done, and again, part of it uses restraint and guards against Evil being
done. And how on the one hand has the Will not been transformed by that part of
it which desires evil things that it may become like its part which desires evil
things ? and how again (on the other hand) has the Will not been converted by
that part of it which loves good things, that the whole of it may become good
like the part of it which loves good things ? But if both these parts can be
converted to Good or Evil, what shall we call them ? That we should call them
Evil (is impossible, for) they can be good,&#8212;that we should call them good (is
impossible, for) they can be bad. [Ov. p. 36.] And though these two can be a single thing,
yet except they are divided and are two there can be no struggle between them.
This is a wonder which we are unable to speak of, and yet we cannot be silent
about it. For we know <A HREF="#xii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xii</SPAN></A> that a single Will possessed of many conclusions exists in us. But since the
Root is one we do not understand how part of the thought is sweet, and part of
it bitter, even if it does not completely escape our notice. And how, on the one
hand, is that bitterness swallowed up by that sweet thing so as to become
pleasant like it ? And how again when it (<i>i.e., </i>the sweet thing) has been
swallowed up is it mixed with that bitter thing so as to become bitter like it ?
And again, how when these two frames of mind have been swallowed by one another,
and have become one thing affectionately, are they again separated from one
another and stand one against the other like enemies ? For where was that Mind
before we sinned that brings us to penitence after sins ? And how is that Mind
turned to penitence after adultery, which was raging before adultery ? These are
frames of mind which are like leaven to one another, so that they change one
another and are changed by one another. But here our Truth has conquered the
(false) Teachings and bound them so that none of them can bear investigation.

<p>But if any one wishes to investigate some of the Teachings (in question) let
him know that we have not been called at present to struggle with enemies, but
to speak with friends. But when the statement (intended) for friends is
finished, then our belief will show a proof of its power in a contest also. But
it is easy for every man to perceive what I have said, because there are in
every one two Minds, [Ov. p. 37.] which are engaged in a struggle one against the other, and
between them stands the Law of God, holding the crown and the punishment, in
order that when there is victory it may offer the crown, and when failure
appears it may inflict punishment.

<p>But if the Evil which is in us is evil, and cannot become good, and if also
the Good in us is good, and cannot become evil (then) these good and evil
promises which the Law makes are superfluous. For whom will the Rewarder
crown&#8212;one who is victorious by his Nature and cannot fail ? Or whom, again,
will the Avenger blame&#8212;that Nature which fails and cannot conquer ? But if
that good thing which is in us is obedient to <A HREF="#xiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiii</SPAN></A>
something evil, how can we call that Good, seeing that it has a close
relationship to Evil ? For by means of that thing whereby it becomes obedient to
Evil its kinship with Evil is perceived. For that Evil would not be able to draw
it to itself if it were not that its lump had an affinity to the leaven of Evil.
See therefore, also, that what they call a good Nature is, in virtue of what it
is, convicted of being an evil Nature; inasmuch as it has an evil Will which is
drawn away after Evil. But inasmuch as it has an evil Will, all Evil things had
a tendency towards it. [<font size="1">The evil Will is the root of Evil.</font>]
For there is nothing more evil than an evil Will. For
that is the root of evil things. For when there is no evil free Will, then evil
things come to an end. For the deadly sword cannot kill apart from the evil Will
of its holder. [Ov. p. 38.]But see, already when we have not advanced to the contest (even)
before the contest, the enemies of the Truth have been conquered beforehand.

<p>And if any one ask, what then is this Will ? we must tell him that the real
truth about it is that it is the power of Free-choice. And because it is not
right to scorn a good learner, let us now like those who hasten and pass on
throw him a word, that is to say, one of the words of Truth. For, even from a
single word of Truth, great faith dawns in a sound and wise hearer ; just as a
great flame is produced by a small coal. For if a single one of a few coals of
fire is sufficient to make scars on the body, one of the words of Truth, also,
is not too weak to clean away the plague spots of Error from the soul. If,
therefore, any one asks, &quot;What is this Will, for though it is one thing,
part of it is good, and part of it evil ?&quot; we shall tell him that it is
because it is a Will. And if he asks again, we shall tell him that it is a thing
endowed with independence. And if he still continues to indulge in folly, we
shall tell him that it is Freewill. And if he is not convinced this
unteachableness of his teaches that because there is Free-will he does not wish
to be taught. But if he is convinced when they say to him that there is no
Freewill, it is truly wonderful that in the annulling of his Freewill, his
Freewill is proved, that is to say, by his being in a desperate state. [<font size="1">The very denial of
Freewill proves that it exists.</font>] And the
matter is as if some eloquent person wished to harangue and to prove that men
have no power of Speech. And that is great madness; <A HREF="#xiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiv</SPAN></A>
for he says there is no power of Speech when he uses the power of Speech. For
his power of Speech refutes him, for by means [Ov. p. 39.] of Speech he seeks to prove that
there is no power of Speech. When Freewill, too, has gone to hide itself in a
discussion and to show by argument that it does not exist, then is it with more
certainty caught and seen to exist. For if there were no Freewill, there would
be no controversy and no persuasion. But if Freewill becomes more evident when
it hides itself, and when it denies (its own existence) it is the more refuted,
then when it shows itself it is made as clear as the sun.

<p>And why does Freewill wish to deny its power and to profess to be enslaved
when the yoke of lordship is not placed upon it ? For it is not of the race of
enslaved reptiles, nor of the family of enslaved cattle, but of the race of a
King and of the sons of Kings who alone among all creatures, were created in the
image of God. For see every one is ashamed of the name of slavery and denies it.
And if a slave goes to a country where men know him not, and there becomes rich,
it may be that, although he is a slave and of servile origin, he may be
compelled to say there that lie is sprung from a free race and from the stock of
kings. And this is wonderful that, while slaves deny their slavery, yet the
Freewill of fools denies its own self. And see, if men give the name of slave to
him who says that there is no Freewill, he is displeased and becomes angry,
and begins to declare the Freedom of his family. Now, how does such a person on
the one hand deny Freewill, and on the other acknowledge it ? And on the one
hand hate literal slavery, and (on the other) acknowledge spiritual slavery ? If
he chose with intelligence and weighed the matter soundly it would be right for
him to acknowledge that (principle) that he might not be deprived of the mind's
free power of Choice. [Ov. p. 40.] And here he is exposed who blasphemes very wickedly
against the Good One, the Giver of Freewill, Who made the earth and everything
in it subject to its dominion.

<p>But there is no man who has gone down and brought up a crown with great toil
from the hard struggle, and (then) says that there is no Freewill, lest the
reward of his toil and the glory of his crown should be lost. The man who has
failed says there <A HREF="#xv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xv</SPAN></A> is no Freewill that he may hide the grievous failure of his feeble Will. If
thou seest a man who says there is no Freewill, know that his Freewill has not
conducted itself aright. The sinner who confesses there is Freewill may perhaps
find mercy, because he has confessed that his follies are his own ; but whoever
denies that there is Freewill utters a great blasphemy in that he hastens to
ascribe his vices to God ; and seeks to free himself from blame and Satan from
reproach in, order that all the blame may rest with God&#8212;God forbid that this
should be ! But if he is intelligent he ought not to think that a being endowed
with power over itself is similar to a thing which is bound in its Nature. [<font size="1">The mystery of the Will is a part of a wider mystery.</font>]
And,
moreover, it would not be right for any one, after he has heard that the Will .
. . to ask (and say), 'But what, again is the Will ?' Does he know everything,
and has this (alone) escaped his knowledge, or does he know nothing at all since
he cannot know even this ? But if he knows what 'a bound Nature' is, he can know
what an unconstrained Will is, but that which is unconstrained cannot become
constrained, because it is not subject to constraint. But in what is it
unconstrained except in that it has (the power) to will and not to will?

<p>And if he is unwilling to be convinced in this way, it is because the power
of his Freewill is so great, and our mouth is unable to do it full justice ; our
weak mouth has confessed that it is unable to state its unconstrained Will. For
it is a Freewill which subjects even God to Investigation and rebuke, on account
of its unconstrained nature. It ventured to bring up all this because it desired
to speak about that which is unspeakable. [Ov. p. 41, l. 5.] But that (Freewill) which has ventured
to make statements concerning God, itself is not able to state its own nature
perfectly. But concerning this, also, we say to any one who asks that this is a
marvel which it is very easy for us to perceive, but it is very difficult to
give a proof of it. [<font size="1">But it is impossible to explain anything completely.</font>]
But this is not so only in this matter, but it is the same
with everything. For whatever exists may be discussed without being searched
out; it can be known that the thing <i>exists, </i>but it is not possible to
search out <i>how </i>it exists. For see that we can perceive <A HREF="#xvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xvi</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
everything, but we cannot completely search out anything at all ; and we
perceive great things, but we cannot search out perfectly even worthless things.
[<font size="1">Let us thank God that our Knowledge of things is limited.</font>]
But thanks be to Him Who has allowed us to know the external side of things in
order that we may learn how we excel, but He has not allowed us to know their
(inward) secret that we might understand how we are lacking. He has allowed us,
therefore, to know and not to know that by means of what can be known, our
childish nature might be educated, and that our boldness might be restrained by
those things which cannot be known. Therefore, He has not permitted us to know,
not that we may be ignorant, but that our Ignorance may be a hedge for our
Knowledge. [<font size="1">Knowing that our powers of knowing are so limited we can avoid vain and weary
searching.</font>] For see how we wish to know even the height of heaven and the breadth
of the earth, but we cannot know ; and because we cannot know we are thus
restrained from toiling. Therefore, our Ignorance is found to be a boundary for
our Knowledge, and our want of Knowledge (lit. simpleness) continually controls
the impetuosity of our boldness. For when a man knows that he cannot measure a
spring of water, by the very fact that he cannot, he is prevented from drawing
out what is inexhaustible. [Ov. p. 42, l. 5.] And by this experience it is seen that our weakness
is a wall in the face of our boldness. Thus, too, when we know that we cannot
know, we cease to investigate. For if, when we know little, the impetuosity of
boldness carries us on and proceeds to those things which may not be known, who
is there who will not give thanks to Him. Who has restrained us from this
wearisomeness, even if we do not wish to remain within the just boundary within
which He has set us ? Our Ignorance, therefore, is a bridle to our Knowledge. [<font size="1">Yet we are not to be ignorant, but to seek after <i>practical </i>Knowledge.</font>]
And from these instances it does not follow that the All-knower wished to make
us ignorant, but He placed our Knowledge under a helpful guardian ; and better
is the small Knowledge which knows the small range of Ignorance than the great
Knowledge which has not recognized its limits ; and better is the weak man who
carries about something that is necessary for his life than the arrogant strong
man who burdens himself with great stones which cause his destruction. [<font size="1">Our chief Knowledge is to</font><font size="1">
</font><font size="1">know what subjects can never be known.</font>] But our
chief Knowledge is (just) this&#8212;to know that we do not know <A HREF="#xvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xvii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
anything. For if we know that we do not know, then we conquer Error by our
Knowledge. For when we know that everything that exists is either known or not
known, thereby we acquire the true Knowledge. For whoever thinks he can know
everything, falls short of the Knowledge of everything. For by means of his
Knowledge he has gained for himself Ignorance. But whoever knows that he cannot
know, from Ignorance Knowledge accrues to such a one. [Ov. p. 43.] For in virtue of the fact
that he knows that he cannot know, he is enabled to know, that is to say, (he
knows) something which profits him.

that the impulses that stir in it do not belong to Freewill he is desiring to
call Freewill a 'bound Nature,' when the word does not suit a Nature. And he is
found not to perceive what Freewill is, and he uses its name rashly and
foolishly without being acquainted with its force. [Ov. p. 45.] For either let him deny it,

that Evil would be in the man did it permit him to think all those good thoughts
? And if that Evil made room of its own Will, that Evil is good, which has this good Will. For how did that Evil which,
when it wished, finally conquered the Good, consent to give way before it at
first ? [Ov. p. 49.] But if they say that the Good exceeded (in amount), in which of a man's
limbs, did all the Good hide itself, and make room for the small amount of Evil
to go up and show a great victory ? If, therefore, the Evil submitted to give
way before the Good, the Evil is better than the Good, in that it took the crown
and gave it to its opponent. But if the Good consented to give place to the Evil
that it (<i>i.e., </i>the Evil) might be victorious, the Good is more evil than
the Evil in that it gave place to the Evil to do corruptly.

<p>It is, therefore, clear to any one who has knowledge that Weights and
Constituents of Good and Evil neither outweigh one another, nor are outweighed
by one another ; but on the contrary, there are real free Choices which conquer
one another and are conquered by one another, since all the Choices can become
one Choice. For if good Choices spring up in us from the good Root which is in
us, and evil Choices are produced in us from that evil Root which is in us, then
these (powers) in us are not independent free Choices, but Natures fixed by
Necessity.

<p>But if they say that these Natures in which there is mixed an excrement have
110 Freewill whereby they may separate the Foulness from them, let us leave them
a little. Even if we wander a little from our subject, let us go with them where
they call us. For Truth on account of its strength goes wherever it is led as a
victor, and where it is pressed towards a defeat, there it gains the better
crown. Let us leave, therefore, the 'bound Natures' and let us come to 'the
independent Minds' ; let us see if the Wills of these men in whom there is
Freedom can separate and send out of themselves the evil Ingredient, that by
(the example of) the visible Mixing of the visible Evil we may believe that also
the invisible Mixing of the invisible Evil can be separated. [Ov. p. 50, 1. 12.]
If there is a
quantity of harmful poison or deadly phlegm in any of these men, let them tell
us : will 'the blameless Conduct of Freedom' separate this Evil, or will drugs
and medicinal roots ? Does not this fact refute them (and convince them) that
the harmfulness which I have mentioned cannot be separated by 'the righteousness
of Freedom,' but by medicinal skill ? If, therefore, this small Evil which is
mingled with us is not expelled from us by 'blameless Conduct,' but by the
virtue of drugs, how can' Commandments and Laws' separate that mighty and
powerful Evil which is mixed in Souls ? For, behold, as experience teaches us,
(medicinal) virtue can separate from us even the Evil which we have mentioned by
means of skilful (medical) methods, and not by the 'Conduct of Freedom.' For if
they talk such nonsense let no one hear those who would relate empty tales to
foolish minds. [Ov. p. 51.] For empty allegories are believed (only) by one whose mind is
empty as regards the Truth.

<p>If, therefore, that deadly Evil is mixed in mankind like a noxious poison let

is filled up, an emptying is necessary by means of drugs that that poison may
not overflow <A HREF="#xxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxiii</SPAN></A> and produce in us pains and hurts ; so also when Evil is excessive in the
Soul a discharge is necessary for it, either from month to month or from year to
year. For, behold, just as poison becomes excessive in us from nutriment, so
they say that &quot;Evil collects and increases in us from Foods.&quot; If,
therefore, the measure of the Evil of both kinds becomes excessive in us, it is
clear that there must be a discharge and an emptying of the fullness. For,
behold, it is also the case that when blood or phlegm increases in us (then) a
discharge is necessary for them.

<p>Those, therefore, who ought to expel Evil from mankind by a <i>visible </i>working,

But though the sins of mankind do not depart from them they are added to those
who (say that they) purge them sevenfold. For around their necks is hung the
debt of sins for the pardon of which they have falsely gone surety. For also
madness, though it does not depart from a dog which has gone mad, enters
sevenfold into those who are bitten by the dog. [St. Matt. x. 14.] But the disciples were commanded
that they should shake the dust off their feet against whoever did not receive
them, [ Ov. p. 52.] let us shake off the dust of our words against these who do not receive
the Truth of our words. For if vengeance was ready to come for the dust of feet,
how much more ready will vengeance be for the Truth of a word which is treated

fountain of sins ? But if it is Evil as they say. free Volitions cannot block up
the springs of Evil. By what method then is the Evil made subject to our Will ?
For, lo, when we wish, we stir it up in us to injure us, and when we will we
keep it quiet within so that it cannot harm us. A plain demonstration refutes
their obscure Teaching. For, behold, not even a fever within us is subject to
our Will, so that when we wish it may rage and abate. If, therefore, this slight
fever is not subject to our Freewill, who can make subject to our Freewill that
great Evil about which they speak ? If that Evil made itself subject to us,
there is nothing kinder than it, for it has made its great power subject to our
weak Will. But if the power of Good makes Evil subject to us, it is clear that
whenever it hurts us <A HREF="#xxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxiv</SPAN></A> that same Good stirs it up to hurt us. And, therefore, even if that Evil is
evil because it hurts us, yet that which permits Evil to destroy us is more evil
than it.

<p>But we are not venturing to blaspheme against the Good, but (this is said) in
order that by means of what is considered blasphemous, though it is not
blasphemous, the blasphemy of madmen may perchance be refuted. For one cannot
bring into the way a man who is walking outside of the way, [Ov. p. 53, l. 2.] unless one goes a
little from the way after him into the wilderness. See, then, that the Nature of
things does not follow our Wills, but our Will goes after the Nature of
Creation, in that we use them according to their natural adaptations (lit., as
they are natural and for what they are natural). But if even fire is not cold or
hot according to our Will, how is the fierce power of that Evil which possesses
an Existence of its own made subject to the Will of those who are created ? But
Evil does not possess an Existence of its own, because Freewill possesses empire
over itself. And fire always retains its hot nature, but Evil does not retain
the nature of its being even as much as the fire which is a created thing. And,
though we do not wish to be burnt, yet fire still acts according to its own
nature, and when we go near it, it burns us. How then is that Evil, which is
mixed in us, if it also has an injurious nature, able to injure us when our Will
wishes to be injured ? If our Will gives it power, then the wickedness of our
Will is stronger than the wickedness of Evil ; and according to their
preposterous Teaching it is found that Evil is therefore accused by our Freewill
because, as Freewill wishes, and in proportion as it wishes, Evil opposes it.
And in vain do they blame Satan since their Will is more hateful than Satan. But
if Evil can injure our Freewill whenever it<i> (i.e., </i>our Freewill) wills to
be injured, it is clear that they are calling Freewill Evil, though they not not
aware of it. [Ov. p. 54.] For fire which burns does not wait for Freewill to will or not to
will, but it injures alike him who wills and him who does not will&#8212;both of
them&#8212;if they approach it.

<p>But if they think &quot;that our Will is able to conquer Evil,&quot; let us
then dismiss the strife of Controversy, and let us come to actual experience.
Let one of them stretch even the tip of his <A HREF="#xxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxv</SPAN></A>
little finger into the fire, and if his Will can conquer the power of the
fire that it may not injure him, it will be possible to believe that the
injurious nature of Evil can be conquered. But if the fire causes irritation and
pain over the whole body when it has touched only our finger, how does that
injurious Evil, since it is all mingled with the whole of us, not also injure us
like the weak fire ? If they say that He (<i>i.e., </i>God) has not allowed us
to conquer fire by our Freewill, who then granted them power over Evil to
conquer it by means of their Freewill ? But if another Good (Power) granted to
Freewill the power of conquering Evil, all their blasphemy applies to Him Whom
they praise. For all the censure is attached to that (Good One). For if He thus
changed Evil so that it might not injure us like injurious fire, it is clear
that He is also able to change any Evil that injures us at present that it may
not injure us. But if He was unable, is our victory still certain ? And let them
persuade us (and show) how their Freewill conquers Evil when it cannot conquer
fire. But whichever proof they may choose, they are fettered by the one they
choose. If they say that because fire by its nature possesses heat on that
account our Freewill is unable to conquer it, [Ov. p. 55.] it is evident that Evil does not
possess Freewill by nature ; and on that account our Will is able to conquer it.

<p>But if the injurious and hot nature of fire, though it has been created and
made, cannot be mitigated, how, seeing that Evil is an actual Existence, as they
say, can the true nature of Existence be mitigated, seeing that even (mere)
things cannot mitigate one another or be mixed with one another unless they have
an affinity so as to receive one another ? And, if a thing cannot love its
opposite, how did Evil, as they say, conceive a Passion for Good, and make an
Assault on it and mingle with it ? And how, too, did Good mingle with Evil and
love it ? And though teachers and law-givers summon it, it despises their
counsels and makes void their laws, nor do the drawn swords of just judges
frighten it to abstain from the hateful love which it has for the body which
they call 'deadly,' and it hates and denies the <A HREF="#xxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxvi</SPAN></A>
good Source of its Nature, and loves to bring forth the evil fruit of the
bitter Root [Rom. xi. 17 ff.] into which it has been grafted for a while.
</p>
<p>And how does the Word of the True One convict (them), who says : there is no
good tree which yields evil fruit! [St. Matt, vii. 18.] For if the Soul is a good thing from a good
Nature, how does it bear the evil fruit of the 'deadly Body' ? And how does the
Body which they say springs from an evil Element bear good conduct like good
fruit ?

<p>But it is possible for thee to hear, O Hearer, what is greater than this. For
lo, when we will, the Evil in us may 'become lessened' and not injure us. And in
the twinkling of an eye, again, if we will, it may be real and 'fierce' and
'deadly' in us. [Ov. p. 56, l. 3.] O what a great marvel is this, that is to say, O what great
blindness (in the false Teaching) ! For see, that when we lessen the Evil in us
we do not mix anything in it except the good Will alone, that it may be
lessened. And when it <i>(i.e., </i>Evil) revives and rages we do not mingle
anything in it that it may rage except the evil Will. But if our Will lessens it
or makes it worse, behold, is it not clear even to fools that our Will is good
and evil ? Therefore they are alluding to Freewill when they use all these evil
terms, and they are uttering blasphemies against this Will, though they are not
aware of it. For if a man drinks diluted wine and mixes his good. Will in it,
can it acquire strength and become overpowering though he should mix no (more)
wine in it ? And if, on the other hand, the wine is unmixed and strong, can he
lessen its strength by his Will alone, though he mix no water in it ? Therefore,
let them take their stand either on a Mixing or on the Will.

  </table>
<p>For if our Will lessens Evil, that statement is conquered whereby they say
that Evil is mixed with Good, and behold (they say) &quot;the Good is refined
little by little.&quot; For behold our Will is in us always, and is not 'refined
at all, nor does it go out from us.' For if our Will 'were being refined and
going out,' our Will would have already come to an end, and it would not be
possible for us to will rightly. And if our Will does not come to an end neither
do Good and Evil. When, <A HREF="#xxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxvii</SPAN></A> therefore, does the Refining and Separation of the two take place ?
[Ov. p. 57.] And if
there is a Refining of the Good by means of Good so that it goes up from the
Depths to the Height, why is there not also a removal of Evil by means of Evil
so that it may be sent down to its Depths ?

<p>But if they persist in holding this (theory of a) Mixing, that (explanation)
fails inasmuch as by our Will we conquer Evil,<sub> </sub>and, therefore,
instead of 'the Good Words' which they teach they ought to distribute good Parts
that mankind may eat or drink them that those good Parts may enter and lessen
the fierceness of Evil. For words do not lessen the bitterness of roots ; but
the (natural) acridness which is in a Nature is lessened by the (natural)
sweetness which is in (another) element. For facts are not overcome by Words,
nor by Expressions are Natures changed. For that Evil which exists
independently, as they say, can be thrust out by means of some Good which also
exists independently. For Power thrusts out Power and Substance is thrust out by
Substance and Force is conquered by Force. Yet our (mere) Word cannot stir a
stone without the hand, nor can our Will move anything without our arms. And if
our Will is not able to move such insensible and helpless things, how can it
vanquish the great Evil, seeing that a Power is required and not (mere) Will ?
For Light does not drive out Darkness by Will, nor by Free-choice does the sweet
overcome the bitter. If, therefore, these Natures, because they are Natures,
require a powerful Force and not a mere Will, how is it that the quality of
Power, not (mere) Free-choice, is not required in the case of Evil and Good, if
they have 'bound Natures' ?

<p>But if the Will does not lessen the Evil which is mixed with bitter and
deadly roots, whereas Free-choice conquers this Evil of mankind, how can it be,
if it is the very same Evil which is in mankind and in roots, that part of it is
conquered by Force, and part by the Will ? Either Evil is divided against
itself, or there are two Evils which are unlike one another in their essence. [Ov. p. 58,
l. 7.] And if part of the poison which exists in fruits and roots is 'amassed and
collected in us' (and), if Evil is all one, how is part of it in us conquered by
'a Law and Commandment,' and part conquered (only) by mixtures and drugs ? [Cf. p. cxvi.
ll. 2, 3.] And
Counsel and <A HREF="#xxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xxviii</SPAN></A> Teaching are of no avail to counteract the poison in our bodies, nor are
drugs and mixtures of any use for the Evil which is in our Souls. And here it is
seen that the poison which is in us is a 'bound Nature,' and a Law cannot change
it, and the Evil which is in our Souls belongs to Free-choice and (medicinal)
Roots cannot lessen it. Though, therefore, there are many things which it is
possible to say on these subjects, I do not wish to increase (their number),
lest it should appear that we have conquered by means of many words, and not by
true words. For we do not conquer with the weapons of Orators and Philosophers,
whose weapons are their logical Teaching. For thanks be to Him Whose Teaching
thus gains a victory by our child-likeness and His Truth by our simplicity
without the Teaching of Philosophy.
