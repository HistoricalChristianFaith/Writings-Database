<A NAME="#70"></A>70.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> See Introd., p. xviii.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#71"></A>71.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Or Beronice, which is equivalent to Veronica. Her name is also recorded in the <I>Acta Pilati (see </I>ch. vii. in Tischendorf, <I>Evang. Apocryph. </I>p. 277).
</P>
<P><A NAME="#72"></A>72.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> All the other records, viz. Euschius, Sozomen, Philostorgius, and Joannes Malalas, say that the statue was at Paneas. Nor is this contradicted by Macarius.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#73"></A>73.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP>   <font face="SPIonic">  kato&amp;rqwma</font>, one of the favourite words of Macarius, thus linking this fragment of Book I with the rest.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#74"></A>74.&nbsp;<SUP>4</SUP>   <font face="SPIonic">  swthri/ou kraspe/dou</font><I>, </I>perhaps &quot;The hem of the Saviour's garment.&quot;
</P>
<P><A NAME="#75"></A>75.&nbsp;<SUP>5</SUP> The statue is minutely described by Eusebius, <I>H.E. </I>vii. 18. Sozomen <I>(H. E. </I>v. 21) savs that Julian took it down and put up his own instead, but the <I>Chronicle </I>of Malalas (ed. Dindorf, p. 329) says it was still in existence in a church at Paneas, in about A. D. 600.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#76"></A>76.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> For the well-known story, see the <I>Acts of Paul and Thecla.&nbsp; </I>
</P>
<P><A NAME="#77"></A>77.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> It is remarkable that a writer apparently connected with Asia Minor should thus refer to Syria. For the suggestion that it is a reference to his opponent's connexion with it, see Introd. p. xv.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#78"></A>78.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> With the reference to Antioch, compare the mention of Edessa, another city of Syria, in Bk. I, ch. vi.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#79"></A>79.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> The contrast is expressed thus: <font face="SPIonic"> a1lloi tai~j e9tai/raij sunei~nai<I> </I>spouda&amp;zausin, e3teroi tai~j monhri/aij qe/lousi sunauli/zesqai</font><I>.</I>
</P>
<P><A NAME="#80"></A>80.&nbsp;<SUP>4</SUP><I> </I>This passage scarcely justifies the argument which has been drawn from it, that a development of monasticism is here implied, such as only took place in the latter part of the fourth century. For there is no actual mention of the developed
coenobitic life.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#81"></A>81.&nbsp;<SUP>5</SUP><I> </I>Macarius, as a faithful follower of Origen, frequently adds to his first explanation a mystical one of this kind. Indeed, when in difficulty for a plain answer, he resorts to it at once, <I>e.g. </I>in Bk.
III, ch. xxv.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#82"></A>82.&nbsp;<SUP>6</SUP>  <font face="SPIonic"> Monogenh&amp;j</font>,<I> </I>the alternative title of Macarius' book, appears here for the first time, and is used three times in  the chapter.    See Introd. p. xxiv.

</P>
<P><A NAME="#98"></A>98.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> These words seem to suggest a time of persecution as then present. See Introct., p. xvii.

</P>
<P><A NAME="#100"></A>100.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> This statement is one of the indications that these words were written when Diocletian had subdivided the Empire, and there was an Augustus and a Caesar both of East and West.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#101"></A>101.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> The argument varies strangely according as first one reading is taken, &quot;cast outside&quot; (
<font face="SPIonic">

<P><A NAME="#109"></A>109.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Apollonius of Tyana is said by Eusebius to have been the hero whom Hierocles set up in opposition to the claims of Christ. Born at the beginning of the Christian era, he became a philosopher of the Neo-Pythagorean School. He was an ascetic, and after travelling in the East and studying Oriental mysticism, he returned to Europe as a magician. He set up a school at Ephesus. His life, written by Philostratus, is full of fictitious stories. He was accused of treason by both Nero and Domitian, but is said to have escaped in each case by miraculous means. Further details of his escape from Domitian are given in the answer of Macarius in ch. viii. p. 66, 1. 19. See p. 55. That his opponent regarded him as a hero is plain from Bk. iv. 25. (See p. 127.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#171"></A>171.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Contrary to his custom elsewhere, Macarius does not deal separately with this objection, but answers it along with the preceding one, by a very brief paragraph at the end of chapter xxvii. The fact that his opponent again alludes to the saying about &quot;seventy times seven&quot; in the next objection (chapter xxi.), may have made Macarius postpone mention of it until he dealt with that objection. But if so, he forgot it when the time came. It is one of the few instances in his book of his passing over one of his opponent's points.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#172"></A>172.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Macarius echoes the word which his opponent had used at the beginning of his objection.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#173"></A>173.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> In thus laying stress on the difference between <font face="SPIonic"> pe/troj</font><I> </I>and
<font face="SPIonic">pe/tra</font>, Macarius supports the view that Peter is not here identified with the rock of the Church. It appears yet more plainly at the end of this chapter that the &quot;rock&quot; was the truth of Christ's divinity, on which the Church is founded.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#174"></A>174.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Such is the sane and reasonable explanation which Macarius gives of this highly controversial question.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#175"></A>175.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> See note on the earlier part of the chapter. The interpretation of the whole paragraph by Macarius is a valuable contribution to the literature of the subject.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#176"></A>176.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Thus briefly does he answer another objection of his opponent, as contained in chapter
xx.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#177"></A>177.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> It is at this point that the attack on S. Peter begins. Harnack (<I>op. cit. </I>p. 103 et seq.) considers that the opponent's work was here divided into two, a division which Macarius has quite obscured. He does not show why a book of excerpts from the fifteen books of Porphyry should have been thus divided, but he affords valuable though unintentional support to the theory that the work is the two books of the <I>Philalethes </I>of Hierocles. In this case this might well mark the beginning of the Second Book. As the beginning and end are lost, Harnack reconstruct? the two parts as follows : the first part as containing <I>x + </I>10 + 13 questions, and the second part 9+16 + <I>x</I> (p. 105 n. 1).
</P>
<P><A NAME="#178"></A>178.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Thus briefly and in parenthesis does he answer what his opponent had said about the injunction of &quot;seventy times seven.&quot; See note on the heading of chapter xx. This answer is excellent as far as it goes, but scarcely covers all the objection.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#179"></A>179.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> The quotation, as often, seems to be from memory, as the reading is
<font face="SPIonic">

</P>
<P><A NAME="#180"></A>180.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The opponent here shows considerable knowledge both of Christian methods of exegesis, and of the language of the Epistles.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#181"></A>181.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> This is mentioned again in Bk. IV. ch. iv when he says, &quot;Peter, though he received authority to feed the iambs, was nailed to the cross and impaled.&quot; Macarius in his answer accepts the fact.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#182"></A>182.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> This seems to have been a Christian tradition, as he states it unhesitatingly. Macarius tacitly refutes it by saying that the crucifixion was at Rome.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#183"></A>183.&nbsp;<SUP>4</SUP> It will be noticed that he puts a new and impossible sense in the words, necessitating the change of

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#184"></A>184.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> This was a favourite subject of attack, and it will be remembered that the theory of a permanent cleavage between Peter and Paul has been built upon it.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#185"></A>185.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> It is strangely unfair thus to imply that one passage follows after the other. The objector scarcely ever resorts to such subterfuges.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#186"></A>186.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> In his anxiety to whitewash S. Peter from all charges, Macarius here may be said to overstate his case, for he fails to consider S. Paul's point of view.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#187"></A>187.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> He misses the chance of scoring a point, for he might have pointed out the unfairness of the objection.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="#202"></A>202.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> Such is the strangely inadequate three-fold answer given to the objection. The play upon the word

<P><A NAME="#204"></A>204.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The clause, &quot;Who planteth a vine and doth not eat of the fruit thereof?&quot; was omitted by his opponent from I Cor. ix. 7, but here Macarius plainly refers to it.

</P>
<P><A NAME="#207"></A>207.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> This spontaneous introduction of a Persian measure of distance is a proof that the writer was near that part of the world. His subsequent suggestion of a city with so many gates indicates that there were large cities in his district.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#208"></A>208.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> He chooses the example given by Christ Himself in John vii. 22-23, but can scarcely have that passage in mind, for it decides the difficulty.

<P><A NAME="#209"></A>209.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Macarius had ignored this part of the previous objection, and here his reference to the quotation can scarcely be called an answer to the difficulty raised, which seems to have proved too much for him.

<P><A NAME="#210"></A>210.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> This is evidently a slip, as it is unlikely that he placed the Corinthian before the Roman Epistle.

<A NAME="#212"></A>212.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The above summary is in a very abbreviated form, but it will be seen that, unlike some of his defence of S. Paul, his line of argument is excellent, and is a sound interpretation of S. Paul's own attitude towards the law.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#236"></A>236.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> Possibly this is a reminiscence of the Homeric use of the words, as in the passage

<P><A NAME="#237"></A>237.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> He leaves out the word &quot;this,&quot; in which Macarius follows him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#238"></A>238.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> He is quoting the verses which precede the words about the world passing away, but lie omits the word &quot;wives&quot; after &quot;them that have,&quot; and is led thereby to make the strange suggestion that God is the subject, and what He has is the world.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="#241"></A>241.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Details of the measurements of the city are given, which suggest that the writer was familiar with that part of the world.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#242"></A>242.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> The obvious reference seems to be to Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, and her defeat by Aurelius. This would be a matter of recent history to the opponent of Macarius, if he dates from the beginning of the fourth century. Does it suggest that the answer was of the same date ?
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#243"></A>243.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> This is a very natural touch, and it is more easy to connect it with an actual disputation than merely with the writing of a book.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#244"></A>244.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> He places too late the words &quot;unto the coming of the Lord' and omits &quot;and remain&quot; after the second occurrence of &quot;we which are alive.&quot; &quot;Cloud&quot; for &quot;clouds&quot; is another unimportant inaccuracy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#245"></A>245.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> He does not intend to substitute an impersonal power for the Creator; indeed, further on he attributes creation to the Word of God.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#247"></A>247.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The story is taken from the Apocryphal part of Daniel, viz. xiv. 34-36 (Bel and the Dragon). The LXX gives the name as

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#248"></A>248.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The abbreviated form of the quotation is tacitly accepted by Macarius in his answer.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#249"></A>249.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> It is very remarkable that, wherever it is possible, the attack is made on Christ's followers, and not on Himself. Here it is only the Evangelist who is blamed for words which are attributed to Christ. See Introd., p. xv.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#250"></A>250.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> The previous objection has stated that only 300 years have passed, so that this cannot have been written later than the early part of the fourth century. To speak thus is therefore an exaggeration, as Macarius shows in his answer. But it is very significant that a heathen should regard Christianity as universally spread, even before it became a lawful religion.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#251"></A>251.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The way he locates these races gives some clue to the place of writing. See Introd., p. xxi.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#252"></A>252.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> These are also referred to in iii. 15 (see p. 79). Their name implies that they were &quot;long-lived.&quot;
</P>
<P><A NAME="#253"></A>253.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> This is probably a reference to 2 Peter iii. 8, but not necessarily so, as it may refer only to Ps. xc. 4. It is curious that elsewhere Macarius ignores <I>2 </I>Peter when its use was to be expected. See Introd., p. xxv. His very involved statement comes to this in the end, but it begins with the awkward words
<font face="SPIonic">

<P>
<A NAME="#254"></A>254.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> He thus echoes the Christian tradition that S. Paul was beheaded at Rome, but he shows the same desire to put his martyrdom at an impossibly early moment as in the case of S. Peter.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#255"></A>255.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> In iii. 22 he uses similar language about S. Peter's crucifixion, which he strangely places within a few months of his being charged to feed the lambs.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#256"></A>256.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> He adds that they also beat thereby the seed of the dragon, for by being beheaded Paul lured the serpent to greediness for blood and milk, while Peter beat him with his cross. For the legend of milk flowing from S. Paul's wound, see Introd., p. xxvi.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#257"></A>257.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> Apollonius of Tyana is here intended. He was mentioned by name, and this same incident referred to, in iii. 8. See also below, in the next objection.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#265"></A>265.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> He seems to think he is again quoting from the Apocalypse of Peter, though the word used is neuter. He gives no hint that he is quoting the Old Testament, but Macarius passes over the reference to an Apocryphal book in the previous question, as of doubtful authority, and proceeds to quote this as from Isaiah.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#266"></A>266.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> This is a misquotation for &quot;receive.&quot;

</P>
<P><A NAME="#269"></A>269.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> As he has made no previous reference to Isaiah, it would seem that the words are attributed to God.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#270"></A>270.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> With this cursory mention Macarius passes on from the words of that Apocryphal book, as quoted in the first objection he is answering (chapter vi.), and proceeds to Isaiah's similar words, adduced without acknowledgment in chapter vii. It is evident that he regarded this Apocalypse as quite outside the canon.

<P>
<A NAME="#281"></A>281.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> In this last brief paragraph Macarius answers a further objection, thus curtailing his own chapters for the second time in Book IV.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#282"></A>282.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Thus does Macarius run away from the point, and content himself with an allegorical interpretation.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#285"></A>285.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> It is only here that Macarius plainly refers to his method of arrangement, taking a number of objections to answer at the same time. The average number is seven, but this is not always strictly adhered to. The odd thing is that in this case the number of questions answered consecutively is only six.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#286"></A>286.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Macarius refers elsewhere to the Emperor as
<font face="SPIonic"> basileu&amp;j</font>. Apparently there had just been a &quot;royal progress&quot; in the East in his locality. It may be only a bit of sham realism, or an event which occurred when Macarius was writing his book ; but on the face of it, it seems to give some support to the theory of a real dialogue.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#287"></A>287.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The passage which begins here, and continues to the end of the paragraph (268 words in the Greek) is the only one where the inner doctrines of the Christian Creed are expounded. It is either a later interpolation, or an exception to the usual style of the book. In the latter case, it is not easy to reconcile with an early date for Macarius. See Introd., pp. xviii and xxviii.
</P>
<P><A NAME="#288"></A>288.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> It is to be noted that he here misquotes his text, and assists his argument by reading
<font face="SPIonic">
tou~ pneu&amp;matoj</font><I> </I>instead of <font face="SPIonic"> e0n tw~| pneu&amp;mati</font>,<I> </I>thus making &quot;in the name of&quot; refer to Him as well as to Christ.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#289"></A>289.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> This is the seemingly Post-Nicene phrase which has inclined so many critics to assign a late date to Macarius. But see Introd., p. xviii. n. 3, and p. 155 n. 1. The theory that the passage is a later interpolation is supported by the subject of the next objection. Could Macarius have chosen anything more unfortunate than the Three Persons to lend on to a defence of the Monarchy of God ?
</P>
<P><A NAME="#290"></A>290.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> This objection and the next, and also the answers contained in chapters xxvi., xxvii., and xxviii. are quoted by Nicephorus, in his <I>Antirrhetica, </I>and are to be found in D. Pitra's <I>Spicil. Solesm. </I>t. I. p. 309 et seq. See Introd., pp. x, xi, xxvii.
</P>
<P>
One interest of Nicephorus lies in the difference of his text from the Athens MS. The most notable in this chapter occurs in the first sentence, where he omits the words
<font face="SPIonic">

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#291"></A>291.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> The word Monarchia ( <font face="SPIonic"> monarxi/a</font> )<I> </I>seems to require translating thus, in order to bring it into contrast with the Polyarchia (

For it is on the question of image worship that he introduces it as supporting his own attitude.

</P>
<P><A NAME="#295"></A>295.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> These first sentences are placed by Nicephorus under the objection of the previous chapter. It is to be noted that the matter of naming was mentioned there, and answered by Macarius, whereas his answer to this question is silent on this point. It is therefore possible that Nicephorus preserves the right order.

For during the period that it was an unlawful religion (till A.D. 312), there were not the larger churches, which began to be built immediately afterwards. But the force of the argument is weakened by the many reasons there are for believing that the philosopher's date is earlier.

<P><A NAME="#302"></A>302.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> Nicephorus is answering the Iconoclastic party, who were utterly opposed to the use of Christian images. They had garbled the words of Macarius to suit their purpose, taking the words
<font face="SPIonic">
ou0 mh_n ei0ko&amp;naj e0kei/nwn tupw&amp;saj tw~| sxh&amp;mati k.t.l</font>., and referring them
to <I>Christian </I>images, and omitting the words just before them. Nicephorus (<I>op. cit. </I>p. 322) shows that Macarius is only speaking from the Greek point of view, as the words
<font face="SPIonic">
w9j fh_j au0to&amp;j</font><I> </I>prove, and that he would not be answering his opponent if they referred to Christian images.

<A NAME="#321"></A>321.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP>   <font face="SPIonic">  to_ prolabo_n kato&amp;rqwma</font><I>. </I>Like the fragment of Book I., the language is here linked with that of the rest of Macarius by the use of his favourite word, which occurs three times in this fragment.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#322"></A>322.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> Turrianus gives <font face="SPIonic"> fa&amp;blwn</font>,<I> </I>but his Latin rendering &quot;pravis&quot; shows it to have been
<font face="SPIonic">
fau&amp;lwn</font>.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="#323"></A>323.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> It is uncertain what form of attack Macarius is here answering. It does not seem. likely that he is simply dealing with the quotation from Genesis about Abraham's faith. And if the argument centres in the difference between the teaching of S. Paul and S. James on faith and works, it would be a return to the earlier objections of a detailed kind, whereas the latter part of Book IV. leads us to expect objections of a more general and doctrinal character. It would seem therefore as if Hierocles had gone on to attack the inner teachings of Christianity, and such difficulties within the faith as the reconciliation of justification by faith with the stress laid upon good works.
</P>
<P>
If this conclusion is correct, it shows us that the scope of the <I>Apocriticus </I>was wider than is supposed or its title would suggest, and the dialogue is seen to have had a much broader doctrinal range than the discussion of passages in the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
Internal evidence supports the genuineness of the fragment. The allegorical and Origenistic style of explanation is quite Macarian, and so is the language. His favourite word
<font face="SPIonic">
kato&amp;rqwma</font> occurs no less than three times.
