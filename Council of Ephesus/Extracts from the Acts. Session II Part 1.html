<P>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 609.)</P>

<P>The most pious and God-beloved bishops, Arcadius and Projectus, as also the most beloved-of-God Philip, a presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See, then entered and took their seats.<SUP><A HREF="#P4447_845745">1</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said: We bless the holy and adorable Trinity that our lowliness has been deemed worthy to attend your holy Synod. For a long time ago (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>pa/lai</FONT>) our most holy and blessed pope Coelestine, bishop of the Apostolic See, through his letters to that holy and most pious man Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, gave judgment concerning the present cause and affair (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>w\#risen</FONT>) which letters have been shown to your holy assembly. And now again for the corroboration of the Catholic (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kaqolikh=j</FONT>) faith, he has sent through us letters to all your holinesses, which you will bid (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kelou/sate</FONT>) to be read with becoming reverence (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>prepo/ntwj</FONT>) and to be entered on the ecclesiastical minutes.</P>

<P>Arcadius, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said: May it please your blessedness to give order that the letters l of the holy and ever-to-be-mentioned-with-veneration Pope Coelestine, bishop of the Apostolic See, which have been brought byus, be read, from which your reverence will be able to see what care he has for all the Churches.</P>

<P> Projectus, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said, May it please, etc. [The same as Arcadius had said verbatim&gt;</P>

<P> And afterwards the most holy and beloved-of-God Cyril, bishop of the Church of Alexandria, spoke as is next in order contained; Siricius, notary of the holy Catholic (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kaqolikh/j</FONT>) Church of Rome read it.</P>

<P> Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria said: Let the letter received from the most holy and altogether most blessed Coelestine, bishop of the Apostolic See of Rome be read to the holy Synod with fitting honour.</P>

<P> Siricius, notary of the holy Catholic (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kaqolikh=j</FONT>) Church of the city of Rome read it.</P>

<P>And after it was read in Latin, Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem said: Let the writings of the most holy and blessed bishop of great Rome which have just been Toad, be entered on the minutes.</P>

<P>And all the most reverend bishops prayedthat the letter might be translated and read.</P>

<P>Philip, the presbyter of the Apostolic See and Legate said: The custom has been sufficiently complied with, that the writingsof the Apostolic See should first be read inLatin.<SUP><A HREF="#P4457_848278">2</A></SUP> But now since your holiness has demanded that they be read in Greek also, it is necessary that your holiness's desire should be satisfied; We have taken care that this be done, and that the Latin be turned into Greek. Give order therefore that it be received and read in your holy hearing.</P>

<P>Arcadius and Projectus, bishops and legates said, As your blessedness ordered that the writings which we brought should be brought to the knowledge of all, for of our holy brethren bishops there are not a few who do not understand Latin, therefore the letter has been translated into Greek and if you so command let it be read.</P>

<P>Flavian, the bishop of Philippi said: Let the translation of the letter of the most holy and beloved of God, bishop of the Roman Church be received and read.</P>

<P>Peter, the presbyter of Alexandria and primicerius of the notaries read as follows:</P>


<br><br><sup id="P4447_845745">1</sup>: It should be noted that in the Acts Cyril is described as having "the place of the most holy and sacred Archbishop of the Roman Church C(lestine." Hefele says "that Cyril presided as Pope's vicar is asserted also by Mennas of Constantinople and other Greek bishops in their letter to Pope Vigilius, in Mausi, t. ix., p. 62; Hardouin,t . iii.. p.10." (Hef., Hist. of the Councils , Vol.111., p.46, n. 4.)
<br><br><sup id="P4457_848278">2</sup>: This seems to me to be the climax of improbable statements. There are many other things which will induce the curious reader to suspect that the Acts are not in good shape.
