Origenist monk (1922) pp.367-376</b></p>

<p align="center">[Translated by Herbert Thompson]</p>

<p align=left>These are the letters of the
Archbishop of
Alexandria, which he wrote to our aged Father, and these are their answers which our holy Father
wrote to him,</p>

<p align=left>Dioscorus writes to Sinuthius the
priest, the father of the monks, my beloved and him whom I desire in the Lord,
greeting We have praised the
admirable zeal of Psenthaesius the priest and
the monks who are with him; for they have put on them
the shield of the faith <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> and they have hated those who hate God
<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>, they
have accounted it as nothing to fight with enemies; moreover&nbsp; having
done this gladly they have received a stone of victory <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>, and they were elect
the more (in proportion?) as they were so. And further they will be (elect) as we believe, especially
because they have removed
the offence&nbsp; from the midst,
I mean Helias
who was a priest indeed for a time, but who was revealed as a
destroyer of souls and on this account we degraded him; on this account we
appointed and
ordained that he should not
be found, nor should he live from this
time forth either in the diocese of Shmin [Panopolis] or in any other city of
the Eparchy of
the Thebais, or in the monasteries, or in the caves in the desert; we being
anxious lest he should contaminate others so as to become zealots and
partakers of his heresy or
his evil teachings.
Hence the matter rests on your
affection to watch that the regulations which shall be ordained be not broken, those which the most
pious bishops will ordain [and
which Sabinus <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>] with Gennadius and Hermogenes will prescribe for the
monasteries of Panopolis. And do thou moreover inquire earnestly also
concerning the cities and monasteries of that diocese and convene them, and
further do thy best not to let any insolence assail the beloved priest
Psenthaesius and the worthy monks who are with him. For we will also care
specially for those convents,
searching into everything. Meanwhile the presence of your Reverence&nbsp; and the
care which you will exercise daily for them will greatly benefit the business.
It is on this account that I have written&nbsp; to you. I pray that you may keep
well, my loved one and worthy of love. May your Reverence make speed to have
the entire Memorandum translated&nbsp; into the Egyptian tongue, so that it may be
read in that form and none may be ignorant of the authority of the things that
are written therein.</p>

<p align=center>The Memorandum of the
Archbishop&nbsp; to the most pious Bishops Sabinus, Gennadius and Hermogenes.</p>

<p align=left>The reasons indeed for which
we degraded&nbsp; Helias the ex-priest&nbsp; it is superfluous for me to write to you,
especially as the bishop of the church of Shmin was with us here in Rakote
[Alexandria], he knowing everything that took place among us, and he having
been the first of all to give a decision with regard to him, as he was under
his authority at that time. It is necessary however that we should instruct
you that first of all it is meet that you should summon the entire congregation
in the great church of Shmin and that a service should be held at which all the
clergy and the whole body of monks&nbsp; in all that diocese should be present and
you should read out to them the memoranda which were drawn up here among us; so
that they may all he made acquainted with the degradation of Helias, as to
whom we have therefore prescribed that he shall not be seen from henceforth
either in Shmin or in the other cities of the entire eparchy of the Thebais,
nor in the monasteries,
nor in the caves and that neighbourhood. Let this matter then be enforced, and
do you execute it,
and let your Reverences&nbsp; seek after him and take care that he is not seen from
henceforth not only in the diocese of Shmin but also in all the other cities of the Thebais and also
their dioceses whether in the south country or the north. For it is no trifling
matter that we are in fear of; but they are matters of prime importance; and if
any one were [merely] to assert that Helias is a soul-destroying corrupter
he would not be able to alter him by what he says;
therefore we fear greatly that&nbsp; many may be polluted by him. The matter
therefore rests with you, if he be seen anywhere or you hear where he is,
to write to the bishop of that diocese and pursue him and expel him as a
heretic. But if
he persist, or resolve to conceal himself, it is lawful for you to apply to the
judges and inform them and hand him over and
let them condemn him
as an offender, seeing that, having anathematized Origen and his doctrines for a time he turned to
him again; and the word of the true proverb applied to him &quot;a dog who has
turned again to his vomit&quot; <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>; and moreover as to the convent which is
called the Parembole he is not to enter its door henceforth nor to remove anything
from, it either by himself or by another, nor is he to administer anything nor
to remove anything among the things that appertain to the monastery.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> For if
any&nbsp; such thing happen, we shall know, and nothing will be hidden from us. For
we shall search&nbsp;
into everything carefully,
and more especially whatever is done in Shmin from henceforth. And let this too be made clear
in order that he may not dare to
face &nbsp;any
monk whatever from this time, especially those of the Parembole, nor is anyone
among those who live in it to he allowed to speak to him or to communicate with
him, or on the other hand to let him communicate with them, nor shall they
associate with
him at all to the ruin of the monastery and its property. And whoever shall be found
associating with him,
let him be expelled from the holy places, the saying being applied to him
&quot;You shall be pure with the pure, you shall avoid sin with him that
avoids sin and you shall err with him who errs&quot; <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>, and further
&quot;These evil words corrupt hearts that are good&quot; <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>. These
then together with all those who wish to
be of one mind with us <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> must be strict regarding
Helias; and let the
memoranda which have been issued regarding him be placed in that church. But
since I have heard moreover that there are books and numerous treatises of the
pest named Origen and other heretics in that convent and in the former
temple of Shmin <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> and elsewhere, let your Reverences inquire after them
carefully and collect them and write&nbsp; their <span class="Greek">&#x03BA;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;</span>
(?) <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> and send them to us; for
it God has given us power to bind..................................</p>

<p align=left><A NAME="4"></A>4.&nbsp; These words seem to have
dropped out.</p>

<p align=left><A NAME="6"></A>6.&nbsp;
The language suggests that the writer may have had in his mind the thirty
fourth Canon of the Apostles (Lagarde, Aegyptiaca, p. 222).</p>

<p align=left><A NAME="8"></A>8.&nbsp; 1 Cor., 15:33.</p>



<p align=left><A NAME="9"></A>9.&nbsp;I suspect that
... the rendering would be &quot;These (i. e. monks) must be strict with regard
to Helias and those who sympathize with him&quot;.</p>

<p align=left><A NAME="10"></A>10.&nbsp;From this it
would seem that the temple of Panopolis &#8212; probably that of the god Min &#8212; had,
doubtless after a partial destruction, been converted to the uses of a
monastery, as happened elsewhere, e, g. at Deir-el-bahri. For Shenoute's
activities against the heathen temples, see Leipoldt, Schenoute von Atripe,
1903, p. 178
et suiv.</p>

<p align=left><A NAME="11"></A>11.&nbsp;I do not know what <span class="Greek">&#x03BA;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;</span>
means here. The word usually means
&quot;necklace&quot; and as such is found in Isai., 3:19 (sah. and boh.) It
occurs in a list of Church property in the Rylands Papyri (ed. Crum, p. 116) of about
the same date as our manuscript. Can it be that the original greek had the
phrase <span class="Greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x0315; &#x1F14;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>
&quot;write them one by one&quot;, and this has been corrupted?
